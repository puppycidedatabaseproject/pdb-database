He was standing in the driveway talking to another friend when Redwood City “Task Force” drove by the house.  They took notice of the men talking and recognized one of them.  They made a U-turn and got out of their vehicle with a very aggressive approach which startled him.  Since the Task Force drive around in an unmarked car the gentleman was confused and wasn’t sure who was approaching as such, so he fled down the driveway to the back gated yard in which our dogs are keep safely.  The police ran after him and entered the yard.  I heard the commotion and quickly ran out my room.  I heard my dog barking so I rushed to the back yard only to be stopped by the police. They had the man obtained as they were handcuffing him.  They would not let me through.  I saw my dog through the doorway and he was just staying in one place barking at the policeman across the yard from him.  At that moment I heard four gunshots.  My dog then fell to the ground.  I started screaming, I wanted to go see if he was alright.  They hurried me out to the other side of the fenced yard. He was out of my sight.  I was completely panicked and keep insisting for them to let me go to him.  Finally an officer came to me and yelled “your dog is dead!!”. They still would not let me see him.  They held me back with force.  It was at least 30 minutes before they finally let me see him, then they told my friend to take me away from the house.  When I was leaving they were also taking the man away (under arrest).  I yelled at him “they killed my dog!!!!”.  The police kept telling me the reason the dog was shot was because of that man.  They said that he had a warrant. A few days later, that man came to my house.  I didn’t want to see him, for I felt it was his fault, I was mad that he could come to my home with that pending situation of an out-standing warrant.  I felt that he brought the trouble to my home. \r\n\r\nI have found that the man had no warrant, in fact he wasn’t even on probation or parole.  He had a past history, but since has changed his lifestyle and has lived free of any criminal activity for several years.  The charges he received that day were “Trespassing” (on my property) and “Evading a police officer”.  He said that while he was at the station getting processed that the police man-handled him and told him that he should “move out of town”.  He had been harassed and actually arrested twice since this incident.\r\n\r\nI don’t understand this at all.  How can the police come on my property, chase an innocent man who was scared because of their approach, and shoot my dog from 22 feet away,  not once, but four times?  They didn’t even let anyone have a chance to put him away. All “Buddy” was doing was protecting our home.  The policeman said that he had to hold a lawn chair up to keep him from getting to him.  The lawn chair he was speaking about is made of solid wood.  It is too big and heavy, even for a strong man to hold with one arm and manage a loaded gun.  When in fact the lawn chair never was moved.  The imprints in the lawn were still under the legs of the chair.  The pillow that sits on the chair was also still sitting in place.  If he had picked up that chair the cushion would have fallen off. There is no way that with all the chaos going on could he have perfectly set that chair down in the exact same place as before.  The officer was right next to two huge redwood trees with enormous trunks.  He could have easily run for cover behind one of those trees.  Better yet he could have climbed over the fence without any problems.  There were many alternatives he could have done.  Buddy was not going after him.  My roommate was also right there.  She is a dog handler/trainer.  She has tons of experience handling dogs. She is also certified animal health technician, with knowledge of handling emergency situations with dogs.  She told the police this, and yet they still would not let her even go see if Buddy was still alive.  There was nobody there who checked to see if he had truly passed. This was just an assumption from an inexperienced police officer. A man that has no right to tell me anything in regards to my dog’s condition.  Buddy was rushed to the vet. His body was still warm. He passed when he was at the vet. He was shot through the spine, neck and abdomen. There was one casing that was never found.','http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:NsCvwI10zsgJ:redwoodcity-woodside.patch.com/blog_posts/police-shoot-and-kill-family-pet-059fc4f2+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us','Buddy','Unknown'),(4,'2012-12-06','California','Whittier','Pico Rivera Sheriffs',1,'On December 6, 2012, in the City of Pico Rivera, a Pet Pit Bull named Chico Blue was playing in his yard.

Owner is Brittany Preston. Owner\'s attorney is Chris Olson. Preston sued the city of St. Clair Shores, police officers David Jacquemain and Jeremy Moskwa, and animal control officer Tom Massey. The lawsuit alleges that in killing Lexie, the defendants violated Preston\'s Fourth Amendment rights and her civil rights. The events leading up to the shooting began in the early morning hours of Nov. 22 when Preston\'s grandfather, who reportedly suffers from dementia, accidentally left the dog outside. Authorities were called to the scene when the dog began to bark excessively. Much of what happened next was captured by dash cams on the responding police cruisers. Before even getting out of the car, an officer is heard saying The only thing Im gonna do is shoot it, anyway. I do not like dogs. Subsequent dash camera audio captured the officers discussing various methods of restraining the dog, at which point one of them can be heard saying, I don\'t do snares, I dont do dogs ... Ill shoot the fking thing. Authorities eventually make contact with Preston\'s grandfather. He initially states he does not know who the dog belongs to. Hey, here is what I\'m gonna tell you, if this isnt your dog, then you don\'t care if I shoot it because I\'m about to, an officer can be heard telling Preston\'s grandfather. Im very close to killing this dog, do you understand what Im telling you right now? I will kill this dog. So if this is your damn dog, bring it in the house. However, before Preston\'s grandfather could allow Lexie inside, the police officers shot at her four times, with three bullets making contact, according to police. Preston\'s grandfather can be heard on the dash cam audio confronting one of the police officers about the shooting. What the f--k, you shooting it right in front of me, he asked. The officer replied, It attacked us, sir, to which Preston\'s grandfather replied, I don\'t think so. You guys ought to go on TV. A short time later, an officer shot Lexie a fourth time. The dog can be heard crying out in pain again, but is still alive. The lawsuit alleges that when the animal control officer finally arrived on the scene, the officers can be heard on the dash cam video discussing with him how to deal with Lexie, who is still breathing despite her multiple wounds. Defendant police officers asked defendant Massey if he could choke it out, the lawsuit alleges. Another police officer suggested using a shovel to kill Lexie. Defendant Massey remarked that doing so would not be a good idea because, You know this s--t is going to be all over Facebook in about an hour, to which a police officer responded, yeah, unfortunately. The dash cam later captures Massey using a catch-pole to walk a badly wounded Lexie to the animal control truck. What happened next is also controversial, according to Olson. The lawsuit alleges a licensed veterinarian performed a gross necropsy on Lexie on Nov. 29. The findings allegedly contrast with the number of shots police say were fired at the scene. The necropsy, according to Olson, identified a total of 15 bullet holes in the dog. You do the math, he said.

However, responding officers were unable to locate the two dogs, which were said to be pit bulls. Later on Monday, officers responded at about 5:30 p.m. to the 700 block of South Norwood Avenue on a report of a vicious dog. Ashley said several people indicated two dogs — one a pit bull and the other an unknown mix — had been chasing people throughout the neighborhood. Officers spoke with a woman who lives at 6300 E. Fifth Place. The woman said she didn’t own the dogs, which were in her backyard. However, Ashley said, she wanted them out of her yard. The dogs aggressively barked at officers and showed their teeth, Ashley said. The officers split up, he said, and each dog charged one of the officers. The two fired shots, dropping one dog immediately. The other was hit and began to run off, Ashley said, so officers fired and struck it again out of concern it would attack someone. It wasn’t immediately known if the dogs in the two instances were the same ones. The dog bite victim declined to be taken by EMSA for medical care.
