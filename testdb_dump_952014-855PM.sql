He was standing in the driveway talking to another friend when Redwood City “Task Force” drove by the house.  They took notice of the men talking and recognized one of them.  They made a U-turn and got out of their vehicle with a very aggressive approach which startled him.  Since the Task Force drive around in an unmarked car the gentleman was confused and wasn’t sure who was approaching as such, so he fled down the driveway to the back gated yard in which our dogs are keep safely.  The police ran after him and entered the yard.  I heard the commotion and quickly ran out my room.  I heard my dog barking so I rushed to the back yard only to be stopped by the police. They had the man obtained as they were handcuffing him.  They would not let me through.  I saw my dog through the doorway and he was just staying in one place barking at the policeman across the yard from him.  At that moment I heard four gunshots.  My dog then fell to the ground.  I started screaming, I wanted to go see if he was alright.  They hurried me out to the other side of the fenced yard. He was out of my sight.  I was completely panicked and keep insisting for them to let me go to him.  Finally an officer came to me and yelled “your dog is dead!!”. They still would not let me see him.  They held me back with force.  It was at least 30 minutes before they finally let me see him, then they told my friend to take me away from the house.  When I was leaving they were also taking the man away (under arrest).  I yelled at him “they killed my dog!!!!”.  The police kept telling me the reason the dog was shot was because of that man.  They said that he had a warrant. A few days later, that man came to my house.  I didn’t want to see him, for I felt it was his fault, I was mad that he could come to my home with that pending situation of an out-standing warrant.  I felt that he brought the trouble to my home. \r\n\r\nI have found that the man had no warrant, in fact he wasn’t even on probation or parole.  He had a past history, but since has changed his lifestyle and has lived free of any criminal activity for several years.  The charges he received that day were “Trespassing” (on my property) and “Evading a police officer”.  He said that while he was at the station getting processed that the police man-handled him and told him that he should “move out of town”.  He had been harassed and actually arrested twice since this incident.\r\n\r\nI don’t understand this at all.  How can the police come on my property, chase an innocent man who was scared because of their approach, and shoot my dog from 22 feet away,  not once, but four times?  They didn’t even let anyone have a chance to put him away. All “Buddy” was doing was protecting our home.  The policeman said that he had to hold a lawn chair up to keep him from getting to him.  The lawn chair he was speaking about is made of solid wood.  It is too big and heavy, even for a strong man to hold with one arm and manage a loaded gun.  When in fact the lawn chair never was moved.  The imprints in the lawn were still under the legs of the chair.  The pillow that sits on the chair was also still sitting in place.  If he had picked up that chair the cushion would have fallen off. There is no way that with all the chaos going on could he have perfectly set that chair down in the exact same place as before.  The officer was right next to two huge redwood trees with enormous trunks.  He could have easily run for cover behind one of those trees.  Better yet he could have climbed over the fence without any problems.  There were many alternatives he could have done.  Buddy was not going after him.  My roommate was also right there.  She is a dog handler/trainer.  She has tons of experience handling dogs. She is also certified animal health technician, with knowledge of handling emergency situations with dogs.  She told the police this, and yet they still would not let her even go see if Buddy was still alive.  There was nobody there who checked to see if he had truly passed. This was just an assumption from an inexperienced police officer. A man that has no right to tell me anything in regards to my dog’s condition.  Buddy was rushed to the vet. His body was still warm. He passed when he was at the vet. He was shot through the spine, neck and abdomen. There was one casing that was never found.','http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:NsCvwI10zsgJ:redwoodcity-woodside.patch.com/blog_posts/police-shoot-and-kill-family-pet-059fc4f2+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us','Buddy','Unknown',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(4,'2012-12-06','California','Whittier','Pico Rivera Sheriffs',1,'On December 6, 2012, in the City of Pico Rivera, a Pet Pit Bull named Chico Blue was playing in his yard.

Cuevas said she understands that the officer felt threatened, but she questioned why they didnt let her know first that they needed to enter her yard.

Authorities were called to the scene when the dog began to bark excessively. Much of what happened next was captured by dash cams on the responding police cruisers. Before even getting out of the car, an officer is heard saying The only thing Im gonna do is shoot it, anyway. I do not like dogs. Subsequent dash camera audio captured the officers discussing various methods of restraining the dog, at which point one of them can be heard saying, I don\'t do snares, I dont do dogs ... Ill shoot the fking thing. Authorities eventually make contact with Preston\'s grandfather. He initially states he does not know who the dog belongs to. Hey, here is what I\'m gonna tell you, if this isnt your dog, then you don\'t care if I shoot it because I\'m about to, an officer can be heard telling Preston\'s grandfather. Im very close to killing this dog, do you understand what Im telling you right now? I will kill this dog. So if this is your damn dog, bring it in the house. However, before Preston\'s grandfather could allow Lexie inside, the police officers shot at her four times, with three bullets making contact, according to police. Preston\'s grandfather can be heard on the dash cam audio confronting one of the police officers about the shooting. What the f--k, you shooting it right in front of me, he asked. The officer replied, It attacked us, sir, to which Preston\'s grandfather replied, I don\'t think so. You guys ought to go on TV. A short time later, an officer shot Lexie a fourth time. The dog can be heard crying out in pain again, but is still alive. The lawsuit alleges that when the animal control officer finally arrived on the scene, the officers can be heard on the dash cam video discussing with him how to deal with Lexie, who is still breathing despite her multiple wounds. Defendant police officers asked defendant Massey if he could choke it out, the lawsuit alleges. Another police officer suggested using a shovel to kill Lexie. Defendant Massey remarked that doing so would not be a good idea because, You know this s--t is going to be all over Facebook in about an hour, to which a police officer responded, yeah, unfortunately. The dash cam later captures Massey using a catch-pole to walk a badly wounded Lexie to the animal control truck. What happened next is also controversial, according to Olson. The lawsuit alleges a licensed veterinarian performed a gross necropsy on Lexie on Nov. 29. The findings allegedly contrast with the number of shots police say were fired at the scene. The necropsy, according to Olson, identified a total of 15 bullet holes in the dog. You do the math, he said. Evidently, based on the number of bullet holes, they shot Lexie several more times once she was taken away.','http://rt.com/usa/175372-officer-dog-shot-lawsuit/','Lexie','police officers David Jacquemain and Jeremy Moskwa animal control officer Tom Massey',NULL,'No',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(39,'2014-07-24','Georgia','Unincorporated DeKalb County','Dekalb County Police',1,'Tim Theall owner.

Ashley said several people indicated two dogs — one a pit bull and the other an unknown mix — had been chasing people throughout the neighborhood. Officers spoke with a woman who lives at 6300 E.

Holst of Sonny Boy Lane, whose 5-year-old German shepherd, Jake, was killed by a single shot after the deputy reported that the animal lunged at him. &quot;We called them because we didn&#039;t want to lose an animal and it turned into a catastrophe,&quot; Holst said. Family members contend that Jake was shot when he wasn&#039;t a threat, but was hunkered down holding his ground 10 feet away. The deputy reported that the dog, which weighed more than 80 pounds, was only two feet away from him, snarling, barking and about to strike. &quot;At approximately two feet, I had no choice but to discharge my service weapon to protect myself from being bitten by the K-9,&quot; Deputy Michael Buenting wrote in his incident report. &quot;The K-9 received one wound to the top of the head and immediately fell to the ground.&quot; A Sheriff&#039;s Office spokesman said all signs point to the deputy following proper protocol, firing in response to danger and when an attack became imminent. &quot;We didn&#039;t see where he did anything wrong,&quot; said sheriff&#039;s Maj. John Clark, who added that the investigation is ongoing and will include an internal-affairs examination of the shooting site. Clark also confirmed that Sheriff Al Cannon met with family members Tuesday to hear their concerns. The incident unfolded May 25 after Gretchen Holst called the Sheriff&#039;s Office for help. The family had been having an ongoing problem with a neighboring family allowing its dog to get inside of the Holsts&#039; electric fence. &quot;They were careful to inform the Sheriff&#039;s Department that their call was not an emergency,&quot; said Mike Gruenloh, the family&#039;s attorney. The primary concern was the family&#039;s two adult German shepherds -- Jake and Sasha -- and their recent litter, Gruenloh said. Buenting arrived about 20 minutes after the family called, Gruenloh said.\r\nAccording to Buenting&#039;s incident report, he drove into the driveway of the Holsts&#039; three-acre property, where he saw a man escorting three large dogs to the backyard. A woman later identified as the dogs&#039; owner, Gretchen Holst, was holding her hands up in the direction of the deputy. After the dogs were out of sight, Buenting reported, he got out of his cruiser and prepared to speak with Gretchen Holst. He then saw one of the large German shepherds running toward him &quot;viciously barking.&quot; &quot;Several times Holst yelled at the K-9 to stop as the responding deputy backed up toward his patrol vehicle,&quot; the report states. The deputy gave several &quot;stop&quot; commands, as well, but the dog came &quot;extremely close&quot; and continued to bark viciously, the deputy wrote. He drew his service weapon and repeated his halt commands.\r\nThe dog continued approaching, snarling aggressively, he wrote. That&#039;s when Buenting said he fired. The family&#039;s version, as relayed by Gruenloh, is that Gretchen Holst tried to signal Buenting to wait in his patrol car while her son was putting away the family pets so the family could talk to the deputy about the problem with the neighbor. &quot;Unfortunately, he continued to drive directly up to the family&#039;s house and exited his vehicle before the family had a chance to put Jake and Sasha safely in the back,&quot; Gruenloh said. Jake reportedly became startled by Buenting&#039;s cruiser radio, Gruenloh said, and circled back, barking at the deputy.\r\n&quot;While Mrs. Holst was moving forward to secure Jake, Deputy Buenting drew his pistol and fired a single shot into the head of the family&#039;s pet, killing it,&quot; Gruenloh&#039;s account said. &quot;It was just a senseless, unnecessary use of force,&quot; Gretchen Holst said. &quot;It cost us something very dear to us. Jake&#039;s not there to greet us in the driveway every day. And I was within 18 inches of the officer when he fired the shot.&quot; Her husband said he thinks the deputy panicked and used poor judgment.\r\nGruenloh took issue with the deputy&#039;s version of the shooting. He said witnesses reported that the dog was as much as 10 feet away when it was shot. &quot;Jake was hunkered down on his back legs, holding his ground and doing exactly what he was supposed to do, barking at a stranger,&quot; Gruenloh said.\r\nAn autopsy performed by the family&#039;s veterinarian found that Jake was shot in the top of the head, Gruenloh said. &quot;Had the dog been advancing on the officer it is more likely that its head would have been up in an attacking position rather than down.&quot; Buenting remains on duty after the shooting, and that is one of several points Gruenloh said the family wants addressed by the Sheriff&#039;s Office. They also want deputies to be better trained on how to respond to animal issues, and they want compensation for their loss.v&quot;I think the officer used very poor judgment,&quot; E.L.

Police were called Saturday morning to the 700 block of South Grundy Street in southeast Baltimore for a report of a stray dog that had nipped someone trying to rescue it. Sarah Gossard told 11 News that her beloved 7-year-old shar-pei named Nala had somehow escaped the gate of her back yard that morning. While she searched for the dog, including posting pictures of Nala on a community Facebook page, nearby resident Sandy Fleischer said she found Nala a few blocks away looking confused and thirsty. &ldquo;The dog was more scared of not knowing where it was and being thirsty and disoriented. The dog bit me out of fear because I tried to touch it, which was my fault,&rdquo; Fleischer told 11 News reporter Kai Reed. Police were called, and Fleischer said she watched as several officers used sticks to try to contain Nala, who she said wasn&rsquo;t being aggressive. &ldquo;You could hear the dog screaming and crying in pain,&rdquo; Fleischer said. &ldquo;I did see one officer that had been extremely aggressive that did have his knee into her chest that was tightening the noose. It seemed (they were doing it) relentlessly and unnecessarily.&rdquo; Fleischer then went into an ambulance, so she didn&rsquo;t see what happened next. Police said the officers then secured Nala using a dog pole, and an officer assigned to the emergency services division, later identified as Officer Jeffrey Bolger, went much further. &ldquo;Unfortunately, at some point after the dog was contained, one of our officers used a knife and cut the dog&rsquo;s throat. This is outrageous and an unacceptable breach of our protocol,&rdquo; Baltimore Police Deputy Commissioner Dean Palmere said. &ldquo;We have no words to describe this. To say that we are appalled at the allegations, I think, is an understatement,&rdquo; said Baltimore Police Deputy Commissioner Jerry Rodriguez. Commanders said they know of no reason for Bolger to use such force on a dog that was under control. Nala later died. &ldquo;She was just the sweetest dog and would never hurt anyone. She was just scared that day, and through all of those events &mdash; being scared and lost, thirsty, hungry &mdash; yes I&rsquo;m very sure that she bit someone, but the actions after that were not OK,&rdquo; Gossard said. She told 11 News she didn&rsquo;t find out until Wednesday that her dog was killed in such a violent way. &ldquo;This dog had a collar around its neck with tags, with my phone number. It&rsquo;s not OK,&rdquo; Gossard said. Bolger, who was also charged with malfeasance in office, has been suspended without pay. He was released early Thursday on his own personal recognizance, 11 News learned Obviously, my anger is toward this police officer. I don&rsquo;t want him to have his job.

Lucy Crockett, a spokeswoman for the Wilmington Police Department, said officers shot the unleashed dog after it tried to attack a police K-9 team involved in the search. The incident began about 9:43 p.m. Tuesday when an officer ran a tag and the car&#039;s owner came back as having a suspended license. After the officer activated his blue lights, the driver pulled into a driveway in the 400 block of Evans Street, jumped out of the car and ran toward Clay Street, Crockett said. Police set up a perimeter. A K-9 team tracked the suspect to nearby Maides Avenue, where it encountered the unrestrained dog. The dog&#039;s breed was not immediately clear. Police reports describe it as a pit bull, however photographs provided to the StarNews suggest something else. In any case, the dog, Crockett said in a media advisory, &quot;went nose to nose with the K-9, as the handler tried to pull the K-9 away. &quot;Another officer tried to make the pit bull back off,&quot; she continued. &quot;But the pit bull attacked the K-9, going first for his face and then trying to bite his throat.&quot; So an officer shot the dog to stop the attack.

Leon Cordell Rosby, a 52-year-old man from Hawthorne, Calif., was walking his dog &ldquo;Max&rdquo; while watching a police response to a robbery on June 30. The California man was videotaping the showdown with his cell phone. Police accused him of disturbing the crime scene, and a video of the incident quickly went viral, garnering millions of views. As three officers approached him, Rosby put his Rottweiler in his car and allowed the police to apprehend him. But while he was being arrested, the dog jumped from an open car window, ran toward the officers and barked at them. One policeman shot the dog four times, causing the writhing Rottweiler to slowly bleed to death on the street. Rosby&rsquo;s knees buckled as he cried out for the dying animal. The incident outraged animal lovers and animal rights activists across the country, and the Hawthorne Police Department received letters of condemnation and death threats. In response, the police department released a second video of the incident, which showed more of the officer&rsquo;s actions before he shot the dog. More of Rosby&rsquo;s taunts to police could also be heard in the clip. After the release of that video, Rosby allegedly went to the home of the witness who recorded it and &ldquo;verbally confronted&rdquo; her and her son, police told KTLA. Now, Rosby is facing additional charges for his reaction, and is being held until his court date. Despite the public outcry against the actions of the officers, Rosby was on Tuesday charged with two counts of intimidating a witness, two counts of dissuading a witness from prosecuting a crime, and two counts of making criminal threats &ndash; all six of which are felonies. He was also charged with one misdemeanor count of resisting arrest. Mark Geragos, the attorney representing Rosby, told KTLA that police are trying to cover up the fact that they killed the Rottweiler by instead focusing on the wrongdoings of the defendant. &ldquo;The videos have shown that these cops killed this dog for absolutely no reason,&rdquo; Geragos said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s precisely why the cops now are scrambling to try to get him convicted, get him into custody and do anything else in order to try and turn the spotlight away from their actions.&rdquo; Rosby has sued the city of Hawthorne for the killing.

MacRoberts said it is standard procedure for the department to conduct an internal investigation of complaints regarding uses of force in any police matter. That investigation will look at whether police operated according to department standards. Christian Yepez and his family met with police Friday afternoon to discuss the matter, but MacRoberts said he could not share what was said because it relates to personnel matters. Yepez&#039;s mother, Pennie Yepez, said about 11 people went to the police station Friday afternoon to ask police why the family dog was killed. She said police did not offer much insight as to what happened to lead to the dog&#039;s death and family members left frustrated that their concerns were not being heard. MacRoberts said police entered the home to execute a search warrant as part of an investigation involving Yepez. He said the dog was shot after police entered, but it remained unclear what prompted police to fire on 5-year-old Nastradamus, a medium-sized mixed breed. &quot;Details beyond that are part of the internal investigation and not being released,&quot; MacRoberts said. Yepez was arrested after the raid and charged with misdemeanor possession of marijuana, possession of drug paraphernalia and maintaining a dwelling for controlled substances.

After jumping from the truck, the pit bull ran toward a man who had just gotten out of an SUV with his dog. The pit bull ran up to the man&#039;s dog but didn&#039;t attack the animal, Schamber said. The man, who lives nearby, scooped up his medium-sized dog and placed it back in his vehicle, inside a dog crate. The pit bull then jumped in the back of the SUV as well.\r\n&quot;Not necessarily at (my dog), just jumped in the car &mdash; but if you tried to get close to him he&#039;d growl. But I think by this time the dog is really confused,&quot; the resident, who asked that his name not be used, said. &quot;We tried to get him out of the car,&quot; said Schamber. &quot;I keep dog treats in the booth so I ran over and got some to try to coax him out.&quot; The dog jumped from the vehicle, only to bark and growl at the men.\r\nThat&#039;s when Schamber called police.\r\n&quot;The Fulton (Theater) was letting out and there were elderly people walking through the lot. (The dog) hadn&#039;t gone after anyone but I didn&#039;t want to risk the possibility,&quot; he said. For the next several minutes, until police arrived, the animal went back and forth from his owner&#039;s truck to the resident&#039;s SUV.\r\n&quot;He couldn&#039;t get back in his own truck but it seemed like he wanted to,&quot; Schamber said. &quot;He would keep walking over and looking up. Then he&#039;d go over and jump in the back of the other car again.&quot; The dog was in the back of the resident&#039;s SUV when police arrived.\r\n&quot;He&#039;s not scowling or growling but this one cop has a rifle and he&#039;s threatening to shoot that white dog next to (the resident&#039;s) dog in the back of the car,&quot; according to Meredith Wilterdink, who works at the nearby Carr&#039;s Restaurant.\r\nThe resident refused to allow the officer to fire, refusing the officer&#039;s command to move away from the car, Wilterdink said. Police eventually placed the resident in handcuffs but he later was released with no charges filed. The pit bull eventually jumped from the SUV at which time police unsuccessfully tried to subdue the animal with a Taser. Moments later, according to Schamber, a shot rang out.\r\n&quot;The dog was running around yelping, and then a second shot,&quot; Schamber said as his eyes welled with tears. &quot;I don&#039;t understand why they had to shoot him; he didn&#039;t hurt anybody.&quot; &quot;He didn&#039;t need to be shot,&quot; the resident said adamantly. &quot;What he needed was to be tethered and maybe tranquilized. But shot ... no.&quot;\r\nRegarding the use of a tranquilizer gun, Hickey said he wasn&#039;t sure if city police still had one. &quot;In the past I believe we did. That said, it&#039;s something that&#039;s kept under lock and key. It&#039;s not something you grab and go in the heat of the moment.&quot; He also said the department&#039;s dog law officer, who typically would&#039;ve responded to Wednesday&#039;s incident, had gone off duty about 30 minutes prior to the incident. &quot;There were a lot of factors here &mdash; rush hour in downtown, a busy street, a public parking lot &mdash; that made for an unfortunate outcome,&quot; Hickey said. &quot;We&#039;re dog owners too and nobody takes this sort of thing lightly. &quot;Yes, shooting the animal is an option but it&#039;s not the one any of us prefer. It&#039;s a last resort.&quot; The owner of the deceased animal returned to his vehicle after the incident had concluded.

Russ Boring with the Springfield Police Department said officers received a 911 call from a resident near 41st and Camellia in Springfield around 6:15 p.m. The caller reported a pit bull acting aggressively in the neighborhood and running around the street unleashed. Boring said the caller told police that the pit bull was acting in a threatening manner towards a young boy. &quot;It was aggressive enough to where there was a gentleman driving down the street who was honking his horn on his car, who placed his car between the dog and the boy, and ended up having the boy get in his car and drove him away from the scene,&quot; Boring said. An officer responded to the scene. According to Boring, the officer tried to coax the dog back into the home where it came from. At first the dog was friendly, Boring said, but then it became more aggressive as the officer tried to get it back on the property. Boring said the pit bull &quot;growled, it snarled, it showed it&#039;s teeth and it became pretty aggressive.&quot; As the dog approached the officer, Boring said the officer believed he was in danger. &quot;He had to make a decision right there,&quot; he said. &quot;I don&#039;t think a Taser would have been effective with this aggressive behavior and this dog.

The family was out for dinner when a friend called Kerr and otld her the dog broke free from its chain in the backyard and was loose. &quot;I pulled in my driveway and there were 5 or 6 cop cars,&quot; Kerr recalled, &quot;and my dog was cornered in my driveway and she had blood, like a gunshot to her head.&quot; \r\nPolice and Kerr took Kiki to the vet. The veterinarian who treated Kiki called where the bullet lodged &quot;somewhat of a miracle for this dog.&quot; Kiki didn&#039;t have a heavy active hemmorage and was discharged as stable patient who had received treatment, said Dr. Meg Schneck with the Emergency Veterinary Hospital.\r\nThe hospital donated services for treatment of the dog prior to discharge on Tuesday, she said. Schneck explained that she wouldn&#039;t propose surgery to remove the bullet. She said her &quot;recommendation is to leave it alone.&quot;\r\nTo remove the bullet, Schneck said a vet would have to use a bone saw and cut into fragile structures in the dog&#039;s head. Even leaving the bullet in place, she recommended antibiotics and pain medications. Kerr said her family doesn&#039;t have the money for Kiki&#039;s care. &quot;There&#039;s a chance that she could have to be put down or die from it,&quot; she said. \r\nKerr said they understand police officers need to protect themselves, but the family thinks the force was a little too excessive. &quot;People said she was trying to get back inside.

The officer found two people- one limping and one bleeding from the leg- saying they were bit by a dog. He was told both dogs belong to Ellis so he parked outside the owner&#039;s home and waited for animal control. The two pit bulls returned as he was questioning one of the bite victims.

After the officer yelled at the neighbor to &quot;watch out&quot; the dog turned toward the officer, growled and started running at him. Bella got less than 10-yards from the officer when he fired those fatal shots. &ldquo;They just got a call and seen my dog and thought it was it.&rdquo; Ellis believes another neighbor&rsquo;s pit bull was responsible for attacking two people, not his dog. &ldquo;I think it was a mistaken identity.&rdquo; But according to police reports, witnesses recognized Bella by a large tumor on her backside.

The yard is clearly marked by multiple &ldquo;Beware of Dog&rdquo; signs. Chamberlin said he&rsquo;s not sure if the officer saw the dog before he entered the yard. He also said he did not know why the officer had the son&rsquo;s keys.

He also was angered that police did not allow him to rush the dog to a veterinarian. &ldquo;It took him 30 to 40 minutes to die,&rdquo; Beck said.','http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2014/aug/27/spokane-valley-fficer-shoots-dog-attacked/','Cash','Unknown',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(137,'2014-07-25','New York','Springville','Erie County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department',1,'Megan Shimburski, 25, was spending a quiet afternoon with her children at her parents&rsquo; countryside East Concord residence on July 25, 2014. It was a normal day, she said, which involved watching her 5-year-old daughter play behind the house with their dog, as her infant son lied in a playpen inside the house. Ms. Shimburski&rsquo;s parents, John Shimburski and Martha Spaulding, were not at home when the day turned to chaos. At around 2:00 p.m., Ms. Shimburski recalled that she ducked inside the house for a moment to use the restroom. She became alerted to something occurring when the family&rsquo;s two dogs began barking; one was inside and one was outside the house. Ms. Shimburski said that she looked out the window and saw two vehicles parked outside &mdash; a car and an SUV &mdash; along with unidentified men, one of whom had a gun drawn. Panicked, she rushed outside toward danger to attend to her daughter, Makenna, who was accompanied by &ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; a 2-year-old Brindle Pit Bull. The Shimburski family&#039;s &quot;big baby,&quot; called Lady. (Source: Megan Shimburski) The Shimburski family&rsquo;s &ldquo;big baby,&rdquo; called Lady. (Source: Megan Shimburski)\r\n&ldquo;I heard 2 shots fired, and Lady yelp, and my daughter scream,&rdquo; Ms. Shimburski told Police State USA. The armed stranger had just shot the family&rsquo;s beloved pet in the head, with Makenna standing &ldquo;20 feet behind [the dog] in the exact same direction.&rdquo; &ldquo;He then proceeded to continue walking up the hill with his gun raised, and I screamed at him not to shoot his gun again,&rdquo; she added. Ms. Shimburski says that there was no clear indication of who the intruders were; there were no markings on the vehicles and the three men were not in uniforms. She described them as dressed in &ldquo;business attire&rdquo; &mdash; definitely not uniforms. &ldquo;I stated that I was going to call the police, and that&rsquo;s when they said, &lsquo;We are the Erie County Police,&rsquo;&rdquo; Ms. Shimburski recalled. The men began then began to request to enter her parents&rsquo; home. Ms. Shimburski declined, and tended to her children and dogs. Lady was bleeding profusely. Makenna was cowering nearby crying, &ldquo;The man shot Lady. He shot my dog.&rdquo; As Ms. Shimburski took her daughter inside, she discovered that two of the self-described &ldquo;officers&rdquo; had already entered her parents&rsquo; home, after she had explicitly told them to stay out. &ldquo;They were yelling at me to tell my daughter it was OK,&rdquo; she said. The young mom secured her daughter in a bedroom along with the second dog that had been indoors. Her parents quickly arrived after being notified about what had happened. The reason for the intrusion was finally made known when they announced that they were looking for the father of Ms. Shimburski&rsquo;s son. The family told the officers that the man they were seeking had never lived there, didn&rsquo;t receive mail at the address, and that they should have tried looking for him at his own home. The police had not brought a warrant, and said they only wanted to ask the man some questions. They continued to request a search of the home. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to GRAZE her.&rdquo;\r\nMeanwhile Lady, described as a &ldquo;67-pound big baby,&rdquo; was hiding under the deck, covered in blood. A bullet had traveled through the tissue on her head, neck, and shoulder. A large, open gash allowed blood to pour down her face into her eyes and nose. It was a shocking sight for the family. &ldquo;The officer stated that he had just &lsquo;grazed&rsquo; her, and that she would be fine,&rdquo; Ms. Shimburski recalled. &ldquo;I looked at him and said, &lsquo;You did not graze her!!&rsquo; His words were, &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to GRAZE her.&rsquo;&rdquo; The shooter &mdash; [later identified as Erie County Sheriff&#039;s Detective Greg McCarthy] &mdash; claimed he shot in self-defense because the dog was &ldquo;charging and barking.&rdquo; Ms. Shimburski says that he exaggerated the dog&rsquo;s actions and the distance he was standing from her when he fired.  No one was bitten or in danger, she said, and the dog was coming from the back to the front of the house to investigate the strange visitors. &ldquo;My child could have been shot,&rdquo; Ms. Shimburski said to Police State USA. &ldquo;She now has the idea that these people who were there to protect people are bad people,&rdquo; and added that she may need counseling. &ldquo;I stated that not all cops are bad but at this point I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s going to trust them.&rdquo; Lady ultimately survived, after an emergency surgery, 60 metal stitches, and $1,200.00 in veterinarian bills. &ldquo;The police did not leave names or numbers, nor did they show any remorse,&rdquo; Ms. Shimburski said. In fact, she had been left with no paperwork; no business card; no record whatsoever of what had happened. Regardless, the family attempted to get past the incident.  Young Makenna dealt with confused feelings about the shooting and Lady slowly recovered from her injuries at home.  Ms. Shimburski did not even have a confirmed phone number to call regarding the incident.  Until 11 days later&hellip; A &ldquo;Dangerous Animal&rdquo;\r\nThe family found that their troubles were not yet over on August 5th, when police returned for another visit.  This time, they brought paperwork: a document that read &ldquo;Order to Seize Dog.&rdquo; The Erie County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office, unsatisfied that Lady had survived the first encounter, had sought out another legal method of killing her.  Describing Lady as &ldquo;dangerous dog &mdash; pit bull,&rdquo; the document authorized deputies to &ldquo;seize the said dog harbored by the said Megan Shimburski&rdquo; and to &ldquo;hold, care for, or dispose of&rdquo; Lady, pursuant to New York&rsquo;s Agriculture and Markets Law, Article 7, Section 123. The deputy and an animal control officer took Lady away to the animal warden, leaving her with an uncertain fate.  Pending a court date on August 12th, Lady may be euthanized if found to be a &ldquo;dangerous dog.&rdquo; The document was signed by Gene R. Heintz, Justice of the Town of Sardina.  It also confirms that the men at the property on July 25th were Erie County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office detectives Graham, Noecher, and McCarthy.  The man who shot Lady was Detective Greg McCarthy. &ldquo;I am outraged and disgusted by their behavior,&rdquo; Ms. Shimburski said in an interview.  &ldquo;They put my child&rsquo;s life in danger because of their negligence.

Officer Brian Thierbach was forced to resign and has been charged with aggravated animal cruelty, a felony charge. He turned himself in on June 6. Brandon Carpenter, 28, told The Huffington Post Tuesday that he and 21-year-old Logan Laliberte, both of Maine, had hopped off a freight train and were walking through the town of Sulphur, Louisiana, with Carpenter&#039;s dog -- a 14-month-old Labrador, Newfoundland, golden retriever mix named Arzy Kensington -- when it started raining. The men were on their way to visit friends in Lake Charles. They climbed into the back of a parked box truck in the near-empty parking lot of the Southwest Daily News to take shelter, Carpenter said. Before long, a police car pulled up and an officer, gun drawn, ordered them out of the truck. The officer, Brian Thierbach of the Sulphur Police Department, spotted Arzy and told the men to &quot;get your dog,&quot; according to Carpenter. He said the officer watched him tie Arzy to a nearby fence with a 3 1/2-foot leash before Thierbach handcuffed both men, ordered them to the ground facing away from Arzy, and asked, &quot;Is this dog going to bite me or attack me?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; Carpenter said he responded. &quot;He is an incredibly friendly dog.&quot; Twenty seconds later, Carpenter told HuffPost, he heard a single shot. Eric Midkiff, Southwest Daily News circulation manager, said his boss phoned him around 7 a.m., asking if he knew anything about the men in the parking lot. Midkiff &quot;took off&quot; and headed to the office, and by the time he arrived, &quot;the officer already had Brandon and the other guy on the ground.&quot; Midkiff, 33, told HuffPost he stayed about 20 feet from the men, and heard Thierbach asking if the dog was going to attack. Midkiff said Thierbach was standing on the bumper of the box truck petting Arzy. &quot;The dog was rubbing up against the cop,&quot; Midkiff said. &quot;He would rub the dog&#039;s back and then push him away. All of a sudden, he just jumped down and shot the dog in the head.&quot; Midkiff said he could see both Thierbach and the dog clearly. &quot;That dog did not bite that officer,&quot; he said. &quot;The dog was wagging his tail, his tongue was hanging out.&quot; Carpenter said he spun around when he heard the gunshot. &quot;I see my dog kind of start shaking and batting at his head,&quot; he said. &quot;I saw the blood start to run down his face. &hellip; I&#039;m watching my dog die while I&#039;m sitting in cuffs.&quot; Thierbach, Carpenter told HuffPost, &quot;seemed to be fighting back a smile.&quot; He said he asked the cop why he was smiling, and that Thierbach &quot;smirked&quot; and replied, &quot;Well, he nipped at my foot.&quot; Backup officers put Arzy&#039;s body in a trash bag and threw it into the back of a vehicle, Carpenter said. According to the Southwest Daily News, police charged Carpenter and Laliberte with trespassing and kept them in jail for a few hours.\r\nMidkiff said he watched as other officers questioned Thierbach about the shooting. Within about 15 minutes, he said, Thierbach&#039;s story changed. He first claimed to have been bitten on the calf, then on the back of his heel. Later, another officer took a photograph of his toe.

Owners Ryan and Toni Walker. \r\nThe sheriff&rsquo;s office received a call of dogs, belonging to Ryan and Toni Walker, running loose and on a neighbor&rsquo;s property in the area of the 22000 block of FM 1541. In May one of the Walkers&rsquo; other dogs had bitten a 16-year-old boy who lived in the complaining party&rsquo;s residence. Upon leaving the Walker&rsquo;s home, the investigating deputy, John Vaught, shot and killed a charging dog, an Australian Shepherd named Blue, at the Walker&rsquo;s residence in the front yard. &ldquo;This was an unfortunate incident, and I want to publicly express my sympathy and condolences to the dog&rsquo;s owners, Ryan and Toni Walker, as I know they considered Blue to be a member of their family,&rdquo; Richardson said. &ldquo;After reviewing the discharge of a firearm report, I have decided to change our policy regarding canine encounters. The new policy will be in effect after review by legal counsel. It will outline some specific actions and strategies that should help officers avoid using deadly force against canines.&rdquo;\r\nBecause deputies frequently come into contact with dogs each day, from making traffic stops, serving warrants and conducting interviews, Jim Osorio of Canine Encounters Law Enforcement Training of Arlington will conduct a training Oct. 13-14 at the Randall County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office. Osorio&rsquo;s program includes factors contributing to a dog bite, types of aggressive dogs, dog body language, encountering dogs on the job, report writing, use of force continuum, tools of the trade and self-defense against dogs. &ldquo;This training will give officers option and strategies in dealing with aggressive and dangerous dogs and the tools on how to best deescalate these situations,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It will also provide our officers with knowledge and tactics so they can better protect themselves, the citizens we serve and the dogs that officers encounter.&rdquo; Richardson said that the Facebook page &ldquo;Justice for Blue&rdquo; contains false statements regarding the incident. Because of those statements, Richardson showed the dash camera video from the incident to press during the conference. &ldquo;Specific statements indicating that the dog was &lsquo;shot just for barking&rsquo; and that a &lsquo;child was endangered&rsquo; by the shots that were fired, are both inaccurate,&rdquo; Richardson said. When Vaught arrived at the complainant&rsquo;s house, the dogs were no longer there, according to a copy of the incident report provided by the Randall County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office. The deputy then went to the Walkers&rsquo; home, and when he attempted to exit the vehicle two dogs appeared with one charging aggressively, according to the report. Vaught reported that he used pepper spray to protect himself, but it &ldquo;had little effect on the dog.&rdquo; He wrote that once he made contact with Toni Walker, the two dogs &ldquo;became very friendly.&rdquo; The law states that dogs can run unconfined and without leashes if the owners provide a plot of land of at least 5 acres. The Walkers&rsquo; property meets that requirement, but a violation still occurs if the dogs leave the property, Richardson said. The video shows the officer coming out the home, veer out the frame to avoid going near the dog, which was under a parked vehicle. The dog runs toward the officer, which is when shots were fired. However, the officer using his firearm cannot be seen in the video. Richardson said the officer fired five times and shot the dog twice. Toni Walker then comes out of the home holding a small child. Richardson said the dog was still alive, but Walker asked the officer to shoot Blue once more to humanely kill the animal.\r\n&ldquo;The next inaccuracy on the Facebook page is that I provided an &lsquo;edited&rsquo; version of the dash camera footage to the Walkers. Be design the dash camera footage cannot be edited, or it would be of no evidentiary value,&rdquo; Richardson said.\r\nIn the video Toni Walker can be heard apologizing for being extremely upset, to which the officer replies that he understands. Before leaving the scene, Vaught can be heard asking Walker if she would like him to move the dog. She responded that she wanted to move him, and then asked Vaught to hold her 7-month-old son. Walker can then be seen picking up the dog and carrying it behind the home while Vaught follows her with the baby. Vaught then provided Walker with a card for the sheriff&rsquo;s office should she need anything or have other concerns. &ldquo;The question isn&rsquo;t whether or not this was a justified use of force; the question is &lsquo;was it avoidable.&rsquo; My answer to that question is yes,&rdquo; Richardson said. Richardson said he was saddened by the incident, especially witnessing on the video a very upset Toni Walker carry Blue behind the house. He also said that he offered to buy the Walkers&rsquo; a new dog, but was told their other dog was pregnant with puppies fathered by Blue. Richardson said he went to the Walkers&rsquo; home and gave Toni Walker a $500 check to cover veterinary expenses. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been pretty blasted over that, but I did it out of the goodness of my heart,&rdquo; Richardson said. The Walkers have stated they have no intention on cashing the check, but are looking into acquiring legal counsel.','http://www.myplainview.com/canyon/c_top_stories/article_14e54b22-2245-11e4-84ae-001a4bcf887a.html','Blue','John Vaught','No','No','No','Not Sure','Uniform','Yes','Not Sure','No','No','Not \r\nSure','No'),(146,'2014-07-27','Missouri','Columbia','Howard County Sheriff Department',1,'Victim King pitbull mix, shot with a 12 gauge shotgun.

Wynston said Yayo &quot;was walking toward the officer, but she was not aggressive or nothing until he pulled his gun.&quot; The dog, she said, &quot;wasn&#039;t an aggressive dog, but when people came in our yard, even if she knew them, she&#039;d bark.&quot; Police said their records show neither dog as being licensed or vaccinated, and that Yayo&#039;s license had been revoked in Howard County in 2008. The dog was sent to New York to live with a family member, and there was no record of her having been re-licensed in the county, Llewellyn said.

Wynston&#039;s other dog was allowed to stay at the home, as officers did not see them running loose, Llewellyn said. A citation was issued for failure to license and vaccinate the dog.

The dog, named Cream, was shot and killed by Anderson police, who arrived at their home to investigate a stolen cell phone. Police tell FOX Carolina they were forced to shoot the dog to protect themselves. Adrien Best, who had two adults, three teens and three young children at her home Monday evening on East Franklin Street, said she heard the shots. She was inside the house when one of her sons told her police were pulling up the driveway. She said by the time she reached the front door, she heard two shots fired. She said she was immediately worried about her children playing outside. Then she realized one of her family&#039;s dogs had been shot by officers. &quot;I tried to gather the kids up to put them in the house because apparently you&#039;re not safe outside with officers where we should be because they&#039;re protecting and serve,&quot; Best said. &quot;If you show up with a gun and you&#039;re irate, then you&#039;re not protecting me so I did not feel safe.&quot; Within moments, she found out why police were at her house. They were investigating a cell phone stolen from T.L. Hanna High School. The report was initiated by the school&#039;s resource officer, who is an Anderson County deputy.\r\nThe phone had been tracked by GPS to Best&#039;s house and was being carried by a friend of her son&#039;s, who told her he had found it at school. The school resource officer called for back-up from Anderson police because the East Franklin Street is in the city. A spokesman for the Anderson County Sheriff&#039;s Office said the resource officer was not on scene yet when the dog was shot. FOX Carolina called the Anderson Police Department, who provided an incident report of the dog shooting. It was written by Officer Joseph Chapman. Part of the report said, &quot;A brown and white large dog charged myself and Captain Aman. Officers did draw duty issue weapons and felt in fear that the dog was going to attack, due to the threatening manner it was coming at officers. Captain Aman did shoot the dog with one shot, at which time the dog went into some bushes and was not a threat.&quot; But the family gave a different story, calling their dog a gentle giant. Adrian Gaines, one of Best&#039;s sons, was in the driveway when he saw officers arrive and witnessed the shooting. &quot;The dog didn&#039;t bark, show any teeth, it didn&#039;t rush them, didn&#039;t growl or anything,&quot; Gaines said. &quot;Once he shot him the first time, I&#039;m sure he was scared and that&#039;s how he got up in the bushes and he ran up in the bushes and that&#039;s when you shoot him again. He&#039;s in the bushes bleeding already and you shoot him again.&quot; The shooting of the dog was witnessed by four children, including a 13-year-old named Jeremiah. He cried for hours after the dog was killed. He and others in the family want to know why this happened.\r\n&quot;He was a good dog,&quot; Jeremiah said. &quot;He didn&#039;t deserve to die. They shouldn&#039;t have shot him. There was no point to it.&quot; Now, the family plans to file a formal complaint with Anderson police. In the meantime, the department indicates they did what they had to do to make sure their officers were safe. They said because the dog was not in a fence or tethered, there was no option. For Jeremiah, that&#039;s not good enough, saying, &quot;Something needs to happen.

Zaley was taken out of school Friday morning where she is a second grader at Forrest Hunt Elementary School so her parents could tell her the fate of her playmate of six years, Raccoon. Thursday afternoon Raccoon was found dead of a gunshot wound between her eyes in the woods about 150 yards from Mike, Christy and Zaley Packett&#039;s home off Valley View Drive in Forest City. Forest City Police Officer Sean Brooks, who also lives on Valley View Drive, was placed on paid suspension from his duties regarding shooting the neighbor&#039;s dog while off-duty. \r\nBrooks has been an officer with the Forest City Police Department since January 2013.

Another staff member at the Forest City Police Department learned from Mike the dog was missing. Mike had filed a report and also offered a reward for Raccoon&#039;s return. On Thursday afternoon the staff member put the case together and Mike was called to meet police officers in a wooded area near his house. Mike said he met them about 150 yards from his house. Raccoon was in a bag. \r\n&quot;I asked them if that was my dog. They told me he had been shot between the eyes,&quot; Mike said. &quot;Why would somebody shoot this kind gentle soul? There is no reason for this.&quot; &quot;He was an off duty officer, used his own personal weapon and said the dog was aggressive with him . . . he never came to us to tell us he had to shoot my dog,&quot; Mike said. Raccoon went missing at about 3 p.m. Wednesday after she and the family&#039;s other bulldog, Dufus, had been playing outdoors. Raccoon didn&#039;t return when she was called, Mike explained. He said that was very unusual so the search for her began. The dogs had just received a bath and Mike did not put their electronic collars on them because they were still wet. For the next 24 hours the dog was missing. Mike said he and others combed their neighborhood covering about 200 acres searching and calling for Raccoon. &quot;The worst part is we went right past them and never once did they tell us,&quot; Mike said of Brooks&#039; family. &quot;We spent a lot of time looking for our dog,&quot; Christy Packett said. Brooks was eventually fired and pled guilty to misdemeanor cruelty to animals and misdemeanor resisting a police officer. District Court Judge Laura Powell sentenced Brooks to 30 days in jail, suspended sentence, unsupervised probation for 12 months, 24 hours of community service within the next 30 days, cost of court and community service fees.

Moses&#039; 13-month-old blue pit bull, Gracie, was euthanized early Monday because of the gunshots, Moses said. Her other dog, a 3-year-old bulldog mix named Rocky, was shot in the leg but is recovering at the couple&#039;s home. On Tuesday, the couple said they had barely slept or eaten and had not attempted to clean up the bed and several rooms of the home that are spattered with blood from both dogs.\r\nNeither Moses nor Nicholas had been arrested as of Tuesday night in the incident. The Sheriff&#039;s Office provided limited information and said an investigation is continuing. A sheriff&#039;s news release stated that deputies believed that a suspect in an armed disturbance earlier in the evening on the couple&#039;s street, Flynn Drive near Corry Station, frequented the home where Moses and Nicholas lived. Several witnesses reported a man toting a gun and threatening people during the evening, according to an incident report. One witness reported the man&#039;s name as Travis. Nicholas denied that he either had a gun or made any threats. While checking the perimeter of the home, deputies found an upside-down bucket with a footprint on it beneath an open window, indicating a possible unlawful entry into the home, the release says. &quot;Repeated attempts were made to get someone to open the door, with no success,&quot; the release states. &quot;Deputies entered the house through the open window in an effort to locate the suspect and to assure the safety of the occupants.&quot; How many deputies came in through the window is not clear. Under the law, officers can enter a house without a search warrant, or under so-called exigent circumstances, only if they think people are in imminent danger, evidence faces immediate destruction or a suspect will escape. &quot;There is no ready litmus test for determining whether such circumstances exist, and in each case, the extraordinary situation must be measured by the facts known by officials,&quot; according to a California case that lays out parameters for warrantless entry. The sheriff&#039;s new release reported that the two dogs did not appear aggressive at first. But then, according to the release, &quot;Upon encountering the people in the house, the dogs became aggressive. One dog bit at one of the deputy&#039;s leg. He pushed the dog away, but it came at him again so he shot the dog in self-defense, at which time the second dog began to run towards him. For his personal safety, he shot the second dog.&quot; The release stops short of saying the first dog bit the officer, who was not identified. Moses and Nicholas say the dogs did not bite an officer, and they also give a different account of what happened. She said she and her fianc&eacute; were asleep when they heard a commotion and the dogs inside the bedroom with them started barking. &quot;I opened the door and there were six police officers pointing guns at me and flashlights, saying &#039;Show me your hands. Get on the ground,&#039;&quot; Moses said. &quot;I went to the ground when they told me to and then they said, &#039;Is there anybody else in the room?&#039; and Travis said &#039;Yes, I am,&#039; and they put him on the ground, told him &#039;Show me your hands. Show me your hands.&#039;&quot; At that point, Moses and Nicholas said, officers pulled them onto the ground of the hallway, cuffing Nicholas, and placing their boots on the couple&#039;s backs and arms. &quot;The cops threw Cristina on the ground, cussing,&quot; Nicholas said. &quot;It was obvious that I&#039;m not armed because I&#039;m in my boxers.&quot; The couple said that as they were lying on the ground, a deputy went back into the bedroom. &quot;And I&#039;m in the doorway so I can see into the bedroom, and I see him shooting across the bed ... to my dogs that are on the opposite side of a queen-sized bed,&quot; Moses said. &quot;I heard five shots go off. Around the third shot, I hopped up and I went, &#039;No stop. No.&#039; And he continued to fire a couple more shots after that,&quot; she said.\r\nShortly, after that, Moses said she and Nicholas were taken outside by deputies and placed on a curb. She was then placed in a patrol car for more than an hour because she &quot;wouldn&#039;t shut up.&quot; &quot;All I did was keep asking if they could tell me what happened to my dogs,&quot; she said. &quot;All they said was &#039;We&#039;ll take care of that later.&#039;&quot; Moses said she suffered a minor hand injury during the ordeal, and paramedics showed up to treat it. Sheriff&#039;s deputies took the dogs to a veterinary hospital.

The report says Wayde Morris, 22, got into an argument with his ex-girlfriend and her father and approached them with a bat and a machete. Morris was arrested on a charge of aggravated &shy;assault. He remains in the Escambia County Jail on a $10,000 bond.

The police chief says the shooting was justified, but the family says the action was excessive and unnecessary. Four-year-old Kenya was a German Shepherd Lab mix. She&#039;s been known to roam her Irmo neighborhood from time to time. But her family says she&#039;s never gone far and never hurt anyone. &quot;She&#039;s probably gotten out about three or four times and usually a neighbor comes by [and says] &#039;Hey, your dog&#039;s in my yard,&#039; and we go get her,&quot; said Kenya&#039;s owner Jared Mann. &quot;It&#039;s never been a big deal.&quot; When her family returned to their Charring Cross Road home after Labor Day fun, Kenya was not there. &quot;We found a note on the front door saying that our dog has been shot by Irmo PD,&quot; said Mann. &quot;We found the blood right after we found the note in our front yard.&quot; Several neighbors say they heard gun shots. &quot;My husband and me were both talking to the police officers that were here,&quot; said the neighbor. &quot;And the one who shot the dog said that she had charged him. But we had seen that dog before in our backyard and she&#039;s never shown any aggression ever.&quot; Irmo Police say they received a call from a jogger who says Kenya chased this person down the street. When officers arrived, the dog was back on its property -- in the front yard, near the steps. Mann says they&#039;ve tried many different methods to restrain Kenya, including building a fence just for the dog and putting in an electrical fence as well. There&#039;s also a chair attached to the back steps, but somehow Kenya escaped. Police say when one of the officers tried to go to the front door to find the owners, the dog charged at him. The officer says he felt threatened by the dog&#039;s aggressive behavior so he fired two shots at the dog. &quot;He charged me,&quot; said the officer in the incident report. &quot;I had to shoot him.&quot; &quot;She was still moving 30 minutes later and I asked if I could take her to the vet and they said no,&quot; said a neighbor. &quot;And that&#039;s when one of the police officers asked the other police officer to get a tarp and just covered her up.&quot; Irmo Police deny that. The report goes on to say the officer fired a third and final shot to &quot;end the dog&#039;s misery.&quot; Family and neighbors do not understand why a gun had to be fired and why the officer killed Kenya. &quot;With the dog being that close to the house, if it was in the middle of the street, it&#039;d be a little bit different I think. But the dog was on its own property so I felt he could have left the dog alone,&quot; said a neighbor. In a statement provided by the jogger, he praises the officer&#039;s candor in regard to the incident. &quot;[He] seemed equally concerned about the dog as he was about the safety of the neighborhood. It was clear that he did not want anyone or the dog to get hurt. He seemed like a true professional in control of the situation,&quot; said the statement. Irmo Police Chief Brian Buck says the officer acted in self-defense. According to an Irmo ordinance, it is illegal for any domestic animal to run at large on the streets or in public places. When asked if the officer could have tasered the dog instead of shooting it, Buck said the officer used the weapon he thought would guarantee his safety.','http://www.wistv.com/story/23324440/irmo-family-unhappy-officer-shot-and-killed-their-dog','Kenya','Unknown','Yes','No','No','Not Sure','Uniform','NA','NA','No','No','Not \r\nSure','No'),(166,'2013-05-21','Nevada','Las Vegas','Las Vegas Police Department',1,'Shouting, &ldquo;Justice for Freckles,&rdquo; about a dozen people at the Regional Justice Center on Thursday protested canine killings by Las Vegas police officers. Led by Las Vegan Sarah Hecht, whose 45-pound Australian shepherd hybrid was run down by a two-ton police cruiser earlier this year, the protestors asked for better training for police officers dealing with animals. A police spokeswoman declined to comment on the case because there was an ongoing internal affairs investigation into the incident. The investigation is expected to take several more months. Hecht, 22, was overcome with emotion while speaking of her beloved pet who was a birthday present for getting straight As in high school. An officer told Hecht he purposefully ran over the dog after it had escaped her backyard and was heading toward children playing on May 21. Freckles was dragged by the police cruiser, but lived. Hecht rushed the canine to a veterinarian. The dog licked his owner during the trip. Once there, Hecht made the difficult decision to euthanize the animal. Hecht believes Freckles escaped her backyard after he was taunted by neighborhood children. She insisted her dog would never hurt anyone and had no history of biting humans. While she was at the veterinarian&rsquo;s office, Hecht&rsquo;s father was cited with having an unrestrained dog. Following the protest Thursday, Hecht wept before Las Vegas Justice of the Peace Karen Bennett-Haron as she explained what police had done to her dog and how she had no money left after paying $1,000 to try and save her &ldquo;son&rsquo;s&rdquo; life. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have children. He was my son,&rdquo; Hecht told the judge.\r\nBennett-Haron and prosecutors quickly agreed to dismiss the charges. She has been cited twice for animal code violations, including not obtaining a permit or sterilizing her dogs. Both matters were also dismissed, court records show.

Wayne said he had to call police because local vets and animal services were closed since it was late at night on Friday, November 11th. He tried to comfort the cat until the officer arrived. They discussed what to do, and when the officer offered to put the cat out of its misery, using a night stick was the last thing Wayne expected. &quot;I went inside expecting a gun shot and then I heard it happening on my front porch. I heard at least 15-20 hits,&quot; Wayne says. The officer removed the body, but he had to clean the rest.\r\n&quot;It was nasty to say the least. I was sick to my stomach the whole time doing it. I tried to wash it off as best as I could,&quot; Wayne says. The officer told him to contact police because of damage to the house. There are stains and smashed siding around the porch. Wayne did contact police, but says they didn&#039;t get back to him. However, the department offered WHSV this statement saying they did receive the complaint.\r\n&quot;An internal investigation was conducted into this matter and appropriate action has been taken internally. In addition, the department continues to review the current procedures in handling animal complaints is to determine if any changes or modifications need to be made.&quot; Wayne says he was so shocked to act at the time, but hopes this never happens again. &quot;The only thing I wished I had done differently is as soon as I saw that nightstick I would&#039;ve ran out and stopped him. That&#039;s what I wished I would have done,&quot; Wayne says. A Harrisonburg police officer accused of killing an injured cat with a baton has been convicted of animal cruelty. Media outlets report that a judge found 25-year-old Jonathan Snoddy guilty of the misdemeanor charge Thursday in Rockingham County General District Court. Retired Judge Steven Helvin of Charlottesville ordered Snoddy to pay a $50 fine. Snoddy was charged in January following a Virginia State Police investigation. Resident Wayne Meadows told investigators that he took the cat home on Nov. 11, 2011, after a car hit the animal and called Harrisonburg authorities. Police department policy calls for an officer to euthanize an animal by shooting it, after getting supervisor&#039;s permission. Instead, Meadows said Snoddy hit the cat up to 20 times with his baton. Snoddy&#039;s attorneys say they will appeal the verdict.','http://www.timesdispatch.com/news/harrisonburg-police-officer-convicted-of-beating-cat-to-death/article_83efd3bf-ea2c-55a6-abb9-3a4f1dd360bb.html','Unknown','Jonathan Snoddy','Yes','No','NA','NA','Not Sure','NA','NA','Not Sure','Not Sure','No','Yes'),(170,'2014-08-31','Colorado','Colorado Springs','Colorado Springs Police Department&rsquo;s Gold Hill Division',1,'Claire Herrera was worried after she heard some commotion next door to walk outside and find her neighbor, Patrick Lawrence, nearly passed out on her back steps. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s holding his head, he&rsquo;s hyperventilating,&rdquo; Herrera said.  &ldquo;I went into the house and called 911 and was simply calling for a medic.&rdquo; But Colorado Springs Police arrived next door first.\r\nThis is what happened next according to the incident report filed by officers: &ldquo;On 08/31/14 at approximately 1225 hours, Officers with the Colorado Springs Police Department&rsquo;s Gold Hill Division were dispatched to a residence in the 800 block of E. Cimarron St. to investigate a possible disturbance. Upon arrival, officers were walking up to the residence&rsquo;s rear facing door. While doing so a large pit bull aggressively and quickly ran from the house and towards the officers. Noting the dog&rsquo;s aggressive behavior and stance, one of the officers fired several rounds at the animal as it continued approaching them. One of these rounds struck the dog in the rear leg, causing the dog to briefly end its advance and flee towards the house. Officers were then able to retreat and while doing so the dog again began aggressively and quickly approaching the officers. Prior to being forced to discharge their weapon again, the officers were able to close and hold the gate shut until the dog&rsquo;s owner, Patrick Lawrence (a 49 year-old resident of Colorado Springs), was able to contain the animal in a dog crate. During the subsequent investigation, officers were unable to develop probable cause to arrest anyone for the original disturbance call for service but Mr. Lawrence was arrested for possessing a dangerous animal.&rdquo; Lawrence says the only fact he agrees with in the report was that his dog was wounded. &ldquo;If the dog was aggressively trying to get at him, why&rsquo;s the dog shot in the butt?&rdquo; Lawrence asked. Lawrence believes this was a case of a dog protecting its territory.\r\n&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how he do man because he protective, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; Lawrence said.
