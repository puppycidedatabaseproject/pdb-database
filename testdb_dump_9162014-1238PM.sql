He was standing in the driveway talking to another friend when Redwood City “Task Force” drove by the house.  They took notice of the men talking and recognized one of them.  They made a U-turn and got out of their vehicle with a very aggressive approach which startled him.  Since the Task Force drive around in an unmarked car the gentleman was confused and wasn’t sure who was approaching as such, so he fled down the driveway to the back gated yard in which our dogs are keep safely.  The police ran after him and entered the yard.  I heard the commotion and quickly ran out my room.  I heard my dog barking so I rushed to the back yard only to be stopped by the police. They had the man obtained as they were handcuffing him.  They would not let me through.  I saw my dog through the doorway and he was just staying in one place barking at the policeman across the yard from him.  At that moment I heard four gunshots.  My dog then fell to the ground.  I started screaming, I wanted to go see if he was alright.  They hurried me out to the other side of the fenced yard. He was out of my sight.  I was completely panicked and keep insisting for them to let me go to him.  Finally an officer came to me and yelled “your dog is dead!!”. They still would not let me see him.  They held me back with force.  It was at least 30 minutes before they finally let me see him, then they told my friend to take me away from the house.  When I was leaving they were also taking the man away (under arrest).  I yelled at him “they killed my dog!!!!”.  The police kept telling me the reason the dog was shot was because of that man.  They said that he had a warrant. A few days later, that man came to my house.  I didn’t want to see him, for I felt it was his fault, I was mad that he could come to my home with that pending situation of an out-standing warrant.  I felt that he brought the trouble to my home. \r\n\r\nI have found that the man had no warrant, in fact he wasn’t even on probation or parole.  He had a past history, but since has changed his lifestyle and has lived free of any criminal activity for several years.  The charges he received that day were “Trespassing” (on my property) and “Evading a police officer”.  He said that while he was at the station getting processed that the police man-handled him and told him that he should “move out of town”.  He had been harassed and actually arrested twice since this incident.\r\n\r\nI don’t understand this at all.  How can the police come on my property, chase an innocent man who was scared because of their approach, and shoot my dog from 22 feet away,  not once, but four times?  They didn’t even let anyone have a chance to put him away. All “Buddy” was doing was protecting our home.  The policeman said that he had to hold a lawn chair up to keep him from getting to him.  The lawn chair he was speaking about is made of solid wood.  It is too big and heavy, even for a strong man to hold with one arm and manage a loaded gun.  When in fact the lawn chair never was moved.  The imprints in the lawn were still under the legs of the chair.  The pillow that sits on the chair was also still sitting in place.  If he had picked up that chair the cushion would have fallen off. There is no way that with all the chaos going on could he have perfectly set that chair down in the exact same place as before.  The officer was right next to two huge redwood trees with enormous trunks.  He could have easily run for cover behind one of those trees.  Better yet he could have climbed over the fence without any problems.  There were many alternatives he could have done.  Buddy was not going after him.  My roommate was also right there.  She is a dog handler/trainer.  She has tons of experience handling dogs. She is also certified animal health technician, with knowledge of handling emergency situations with dogs.  She told the police this, and yet they still would not let her even go see if Buddy was still alive.  There was nobody there who checked to see if he had truly passed. This was just an assumption from an inexperienced police officer. A man that has no right to tell me anything in regards to my dog’s condition.  Buddy was rushed to the vet. His body was still warm. He passed when he was at the vet. He was shot through the spine, neck and abdomen. There was one casing that was never found.','http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:NsCvwI10zsgJ:redwoodcity-woodside.patch.com/blog_posts/police-shoot-and-kill-family-pet-059fc4f2+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us','Buddy','Unknown','No','No',0,0,0,'Yes','Yes','Plain Clothes','No','Not Sure','Not Sure','Not Sure','Not Sure','Not Sure'),(4,'2012-12-06','California','Whittier','Pico Rivera Sheriffs',1,30,1,'Pit Bull','On December 6, 2012, in the City of Pico Rivera, a Pet Pit Bull named Chico Blue was playing in his yard.

But when the officer jumped into the yard, he saw a dog charging at him. In a statement, police said, The officer felt he was in danger of great bodily injury and fired one time at the dog. The dog was transported to a nearby animal hospital, and was later released to the owner. Police never caught the burglars. Cuevas said she understands that the officer felt threatened, but she questioned why they didnt let her know first that they needed to enter her yard. If they would have just called me, I would have helped them out, she said. Cuevas said a police officer stopped by on Thursday to give her instructions on how to seek reimbursement from the city.

One eyewitness, Charlene Dezego, told FOX 32 News that she heard the officer warned Phillips about the dog being loose, but the officer never sounded like he was in danger. All of sudden I heard him say, get your dog, and then the next statement was get your dog, and then he just pulled out his gun and shot twice, says Dezengo. Colonel was rushed to an emergency vet. Five hours of surgery saved his life. As for the officer who shot at Colonel, Al, his wife, Barbara, and Morgan said (and witnesses confirmed in TV reports) that he calmly finished writing the ticket, as if nothing out of the ordinary had occurred. While FOX 32\'s Larry Yellen was interviewing the dog\'s owners three days after the shooting, two police officers drove by the home. 90 minutes later, they came back, asked why Phillips why he had contacted the media and gave him a ticket for not keeping Colonel on a leash. Owner Al Phillips  has a pending lawsuit against the city of Chicago.','http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2012/12/04/chicago-family-says-police-officer-shot-their-puppy/','Colonel','Brandon Pettigrew','No','Yes',0,0,0,'No','Yes','Uniform','NA','NA','No','No','Yes','No'),(37,'2009-02-01','Illinois','Chicago','Chicago Police Department',1,50,0,'Labrador','Teenage brothers Thomas and Darren Russell were in their second-floor apartment in the 9200 block of South Justine Street in February 2009 when officers announced they had a warrant to search both units of the two-flat.

Owner is Brittany Preston. Owner\'s attorney is Chris Olson. Preston sued the city of St. Clair Shores, police officers David Jacquemain and Jeremy Moskwa, and animal control officer Tom Massey. The lawsuit alleges that in killing Lexie, the defendants violated Preston\'s Fourth Amendment rights and her civil rights. The events leading up to the shooting began in the early morning hours of Nov. 22 when Preston\'s grandfather, who reportedly suffers from dementia, accidentally left the dog outside. Authorities were called to the scene when the dog began to bark excessively. Much of what happened next was captured by dash cams on the responding police cruisers. Before even getting out of the car, an officer is heard saying The only thing Im gonna do is shoot it, anyway. I do not like dogs. Subsequent dash camera audio captured the officers discussing various methods of restraining the dog, at which point one of them can be heard saying, I don\'t do snares, I dont do dogs ... Ill shoot the fking thing. Authorities eventually make contact with Preston\'s grandfather. He initially states he does not know who the dog belongs to. Hey, here is what I\'m gonna tell you, if this isnt your dog, then you don\'t care if I shoot it because I\'m about to, an officer can be heard telling Preston\'s grandfather. Im very close to killing this dog, do you understand what Im telling you right now? I will kill this dog. So if this is your damn dog, bring it in the house. However, before Preston\'s grandfather could allow Lexie inside, the police officers shot at her four times, with three bullets making contact, according to police. Preston\'s grandfather can be heard on the dash cam audio confronting one of the police officers about the shooting. What the f--k, you shooting it right in front of me, he asked. The officer replied, It attacked us, sir, to which Preston\'s grandfather replied, I don\'t think so. You guys ought to go on TV. A short time later, an officer shot Lexie a fourth time. The dog can be heard crying out in pain again, but is still alive. The lawsuit alleges that when the animal control officer finally arrived on the scene, the officers can be heard on the dash cam video discussing with him how to deal with Lexie, who is still breathing despite her multiple wounds. Defendant police officers asked defendant Massey if he could choke it out, the lawsuit alleges. Another police officer suggested using a shovel to kill Lexie. Defendant Massey remarked that doing so would not be a good idea because, You know this s--t is going to be all over Facebook in about an hour, to which a police officer responded, yeah, unfortunately. The dash cam later captures Massey using a catch-pole to walk a badly wounded Lexie to the animal control truck. What happened next is also controversial, according to Olson. The lawsuit alleges a licensed veterinarian performed a gross necropsy on Lexie on Nov. 29. The findings allegedly contrast with the number of shots police say were fired at the scene. The necropsy, according to Olson, identified a total of 15 bullet holes in the dog. You do the math, he said. Evidently, based on the number of bullet holes, they shot Lexie several more times once she was taken away.','www.freep.com/assets/freep/pdf/C4222331718.PDF','Lexie','police officers David Jacquemain and Jeremy Moskwa animal control officer Tom Massey','Yes','No',0,0,0,'No','Not Sure','Uniform','NA','NA','Yes','No','Yes','No'),(39,'2014-07-24','Georgia','Unincorporated DeKalb County','Dekalb County Police',1,50,0,'German Shepherd 9yo','Tim Theall owner.

Later on Monday, officers responded at about 5:30 p.m. to the 700 block of South Norwood Avenue on a report of a vicious dog. Ashley said several people indicated two dogs — one a pit bull and the other an unknown mix — had been chasing people throughout the neighborhood. Officers spoke with a woman who lives at 6300 E. Fifth Place. The woman said she didn’t own the dogs, which were in her backyard. However, Ashley said, she wanted them out of her yard. The dogs aggressively barked at officers and showed their teeth, Ashley said. The officers split up, he said, and each dog charged one of the officers. The two fired shots, dropping one dog immediately. The other was hit and began to run off, Ashley said, so officers fired and struck it again out of concern it would attack someone. It wasn’t immediately known if the dogs in the two instances were the same ones. The dog bite victim declined to be taken by EMSA for medical care.

Holst of Sonny Boy Lane, whose 5-year-old German shepherd, Jake, was killed by a single shot after the deputy reported that the animal lunged at him. &quot;We called them because we didn&#039;t want to lose an animal and it turned into a catastrophe,&quot; Holst said. Family members contend that Jake was shot when he wasn&#039;t a threat, but was hunkered down holding his ground 10 feet away. The deputy reported that the dog, which weighed more than 80 pounds, was only two feet away from him, snarling, barking and about to strike. &quot;At approximately two feet, I had no choice but to discharge my service weapon to protect myself from being bitten by the K-9,&quot; Deputy Michael Buenting wrote in his incident report. &quot;The K-9 received one wound to the top of the head and immediately fell to the ground.&quot; A Sheriff&#039;s Office spokesman said all signs point to the deputy following proper protocol, firing in response to danger and when an attack became imminent. &quot;We didn&#039;t see where he did anything wrong,&quot; said sheriff&#039;s Maj. John Clark, who added that the investigation is ongoing and will include an internal-affairs examination of the shooting site. Clark also confirmed that Sheriff Al Cannon met with family members Tuesday to hear their concerns. The incident unfolded May 25 after Gretchen Holst called the Sheriff&#039;s Office for help. The family had been having an ongoing problem with a neighboring family allowing its dog to get inside of the Holsts&#039; electric fence. &quot;They were careful to inform the Sheriff&#039;s Department that their call was not an emergency,&quot; said Mike Gruenloh, the family&#039;s attorney. The primary concern was the family&#039;s two adult German shepherds -- Jake and Sasha -- and their recent litter, Gruenloh said. Buenting arrived about 20 minutes after the family called, Gruenloh said.\r\nAccording to Buenting&#039;s incident report, he drove into the driveway of the Holsts&#039; three-acre property, where he saw a man escorting three large dogs to the backyard. A woman later identified as the dogs&#039; owner, Gretchen Holst, was holding her hands up in the direction of the deputy. After the dogs were out of sight, Buenting reported, he got out of his cruiser and prepared to speak with Gretchen Holst. He then saw one of the large German shepherds running toward him &quot;viciously barking.&quot; &quot;Several times Holst yelled at the K-9 to stop as the responding deputy backed up toward his patrol vehicle,&quot; the report states. The deputy gave several &quot;stop&quot; commands, as well, but the dog came &quot;extremely close&quot; and continued to bark viciously, the deputy wrote. He drew his service weapon and repeated his halt commands.\r\nThe dog continued approaching, snarling aggressively, he wrote. That&#039;s when Buenting said he fired. The family&#039;s version, as relayed by Gruenloh, is that Gretchen Holst tried to signal Buenting to wait in his patrol car while her son was putting away the family pets so the family could talk to the deputy about the problem with the neighbor. &quot;Unfortunately, he continued to drive directly up to the family&#039;s house and exited his vehicle before the family had a chance to put Jake and Sasha safely in the back,&quot; Gruenloh said. Jake reportedly became startled by Buenting&#039;s cruiser radio, Gruenloh said, and circled back, barking at the deputy.\r\n&quot;While Mrs. Holst was moving forward to secure Jake, Deputy Buenting drew his pistol and fired a single shot into the head of the family&#039;s pet, killing it,&quot; Gruenloh&#039;s account said. &quot;It was just a senseless, unnecessary use of force,&quot; Gretchen Holst said. &quot;It cost us something very dear to us. Jake&#039;s not there to greet us in the driveway every day. And I was within 18 inches of the officer when he fired the shot.&quot; Her husband said he thinks the deputy panicked and used poor judgment.\r\nGruenloh took issue with the deputy&#039;s version of the shooting. He said witnesses reported that the dog was as much as 10 feet away when it was shot. &quot;Jake was hunkered down on his back legs, holding his ground and doing exactly what he was supposed to do, barking at a stranger,&quot; Gruenloh said.\r\nAn autopsy performed by the family&#039;s veterinarian found that Jake was shot in the top of the head, Gruenloh said. &quot;Had the dog been advancing on the officer it is more likely that its head would have been up in an attacking position rather than down.&quot; Buenting remains on duty after the shooting, and that is one of several points Gruenloh said the family wants addressed by the Sheriff&#039;s Office. They also want deputies to be better trained on how to respond to animal issues, and they want compensation for their loss.v&quot;I think the officer used very poor judgment,&quot; E.L. Holst said. &quot;I am heartbroken, devastated over what I&#039;ve lost.&quot;','http://www.postandcourier.com/news/2011/jun/02/fatal-shooting-of-dog-by-deputy-investigated/','Jake','Michael Buenting','Not Sure','No',0,0,0,'No','Not Sure','Uniform','NA','Not Sure','No','No','Not Sure','No'),(86,'2014-06-14','Maryland','Baltimore','Baltimore City Police Department',1,50,0,'Shar Pai','Jeffrey Bolger, Baltimore City police officer, was arrested and charged with aggravated animal cruelty and other charges after cutting the throat of a dog, police officials announced Wednesday afternoon. Police were called Saturday morning to the 700 block of South Grundy Street in southeast Baltimore for a report of a stray dog that had nipped someone trying to rescue it. Sarah Gossard told 11 News that her beloved 7-year-old shar-pei named Nala had somehow escaped the gate of her back yard that morning. While she searched for the dog, including posting pictures of Nala on a community Facebook page, nearby resident Sandy Fleischer said she found Nala a few blocks away looking confused and thirsty. &ldquo;The dog was more scared of not knowing where it was and being thirsty and disoriented. The dog bit me out of fear because I tried to touch it, which was my fault,&rdquo; Fleischer told 11 News reporter Kai Reed. Police were called, and Fleischer said she watched as several officers used sticks to try to contain Nala, who she said wasn&rsquo;t being aggressive. &ldquo;You could hear the dog screaming and crying in pain,&rdquo; Fleischer said. &ldquo;I did see one officer that had been extremely aggressive that did have his knee into her chest that was tightening the noose. It seemed (they were doing it) relentlessly and unnecessarily.&rdquo; Fleischer then went into an ambulance, so she didn&rsquo;t see what happened next. Police said the officers then secured Nala using a dog pole, and an officer assigned to the emergency services division, later identified as Officer Jeffrey Bolger, went much further. &ldquo;Unfortunately, at some point after the dog was contained, one of our officers used a knife and cut the dog&rsquo;s throat. This is outrageous and an unacceptable breach of our protocol,&rdquo; Baltimore Police Deputy Commissioner Dean Palmere said. &ldquo;We have no words to describe this. To say that we are appalled at the allegations, I think, is an understatement,&rdquo; said Baltimore Police Deputy Commissioner Jerry Rodriguez. Commanders said they know of no reason for Bolger to use such force on a dog that was under control. Nala later died. &ldquo;She was just the sweetest dog and would never hurt anyone. She was just scared that day, and through all of those events &mdash; being scared and lost, thirsty, hungry &mdash; yes I&rsquo;m very sure that she bit someone, but the actions after that were not OK,&rdquo; Gossard said. She told 11 News she didn&rsquo;t find out until Wednesday that her dog was killed in such a violent way. &ldquo;This dog had a collar around its neck with tags, with my phone number. It&rsquo;s not OK,&rdquo; Gossard said. Bolger, who was also charged with malfeasance in office, has been suspended without pay. He was released early Thursday on his own personal recognizance, 11 News learned Obviously, my anger is toward this police officer. I don&rsquo;t want him to have his job. I don&rsquo;t want him to be able to go out on calls and react like that to a person, to a dog, to anything. That&rsquo;s not OK,&rdquo; Gossard said. Police are also investigating whether other officers who knew of the incident followed procedure to report it. Commanders said they &ldquo;caught wind of it Monday,&rdquo; two days later. Bolger has been with Baltime PD since 1992. Following Bolgers arrest, Thomas Schmidt, 52, of Abingdon, was also arrested, charged and released Thursday in the case. According to charging documents, Schmidt is accused of holding down the dog while the other officer, Jeffrey Bolger, killed it.','http://www.wbaltv.com/news/police-dogs-throad-cut-officer-charged-with-animal-cruelty/26553714#!0Zozx','Nala','Jeffrey Bolger and Thomas Schmidt','Yes','No',0,0,0,'No','No','Uniform','No','NA','Yes','Not Sure','Not Sure','Yes'),(88,'2013-06-30','California','Hawthorne','Hawthorne Police Department',1,100,0,'Rottweiler','Victim Max 2 year old Rottweiler. Leon Cordell Rosby, a 52-year-old man from Hawthorne, Calif., was walking his dog &ldquo;Max&rdquo; while watching a police response to a robbery on June 30. The California man was videotaping the showdown with his cell phone. Police accused him of disturbing the crime scene, and a video of the incident quickly went viral, garnering millions of views. As three officers approached him, Rosby put his Rottweiler in his car and allowed the police to apprehend him. But while he was being arrested, the dog jumped from an open car window, ran toward the officers and barked at them. One policeman shot the dog four times, causing the writhing Rottweiler to slowly bleed to death on the street. Rosby&rsquo;s knees buckled as he cried out for the dying animal. The incident outraged animal lovers and animal rights activists across the country, and the Hawthorne Police Department received letters of condemnation and death threats. In response, the police department released a second video of the incident, which showed more of the officer&rsquo;s actions before he shot the dog. More of Rosby&rsquo;s taunts to police could also be heard in the clip. After the release of that video, Rosby allegedly went to the home of the witness who recorded it and &ldquo;verbally confronted&rdquo; her and her son, police told KTLA. Now, Rosby is facing additional charges for his reaction, and is being held until his court date. Despite the public outcry against the actions of the officers, Rosby was on Tuesday charged with two counts of intimidating a witness, two counts of dissuading a witness from prosecuting a crime, and two counts of making criminal threats &ndash; all six of which are felonies. He was also charged with one misdemeanor count of resisting arrest. Mark Geragos, the attorney representing Rosby, told KTLA that police are trying to cover up the fact that they killed the Rottweiler by instead focusing on the wrongdoings of the defendant. &ldquo;The videos have shown that these cops killed this dog for absolutely no reason,&rdquo; Geragos said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s precisely why the cops now are scrambling to try to get him convicted, get him into custody and do anything else in order to try and turn the spotlight away from their actions.&rdquo; Rosby has sued the city of Hawthorne for the killing.

A neighbor called 911 just after noon to report the dog was out, but did not say it was posing a threat to anyone. Police arrived at the Wrights home one hour later to find Rosie sitting in her owners&rsquo; driveway.

The Wrights say Rosie never bit anyone and had never been declared vicious or dangerous or violated any animal control regulation.

The 4-year-old male pit bull, named Pup-pup, was shot in the back yard of a home that he was trained to protect. &quot;I just heard gunshots as I was walking back to the house,&quot; said dog owner Antonio Williamson. It happened just after Williamson came outside to ask why so many police officers were parked in front of his house. They were looking for a man who had punched another guy in the face and stole his bike in front of a convenience store on Pembroke Road and 22nd Avenue. A witness followed the suspect to the area on Wiley Street and called 911. &quot;The police suspected the robber may have gone into the back yard so they entered through a side gate. &quot;When they got to the back yard, they were confronted by a pit bull,&quot; said Hollywood Police Sgt. Lester Cochenour.\r\nThe dog was shot multiple times and died in the back yard. Williamson was angry that officers didn&#039;t knock first. He said Pup-pup was a humble dog and was great with kids, but was also trained to protect to his property. &quot;There have been a lot of break ins around here, in this area for the last year and a half or so, and I have my dog out here just for that purpose,&quot; Williamson told Local 10&#039;s Roger Lohse. Lohse reported that there are no signs on the side of Williamson&#039;s house indicating that a dog was in the backyard. Under the law, police are allowed to enter private property if they are pursuing or searching for a felony suspect.','http://www.local10.com/news/Hollywood-police-searching-for-robber-shoot-kill-dog/-/1717324/16749718/-/emiqfx/-/index.html','Pup-pup','Unknown','Yes','No',0,0,0,'No','No','Uniform','No','No','No','No','Not Sure','No'),(92,'2012-09-21','North Carolina','Fayetteville','Fayetteville Police Department',1,30,0,'Mixed Breed','Victim 5 year old mixed breed. A family whose dog was shot when Fayetteville police raided their Clarendon Street home on Wednesday morning has filed a complaint against the officers. Department spokesman Gavin MacRoberts said the incident remained under investigation Friday. MacRoberts said it is standard procedure for the department to conduct an internal investigation of complaints regarding uses of force in any police matter. That investigation will look at whether police operated according to department standards. Christian Yepez and his family met with police Friday afternoon to discuss the matter, but MacRoberts said he could not share what was said because it relates to personnel matters. Yepez&#039;s mother, Pennie Yepez, said about 11 people went to the police station Friday afternoon to ask police why the family dog was killed. She said police did not offer much insight as to what happened to lead to the dog&#039;s death and family members left frustrated that their concerns were not being heard. MacRoberts said police entered the home to execute a search warrant as part of an investigation involving Yepez. He said the dog was shot after police entered, but it remained unclear what prompted police to fire on 5-year-old Nastradamus, a medium-sized mixed breed. &quot;Details beyond that are part of the internal investigation and not being released,&quot; MacRoberts said. Yepez was arrested after the raid and charged with misdemeanor possession of marijuana, possession of drug paraphernalia and maintaining a dwelling for controlled substances. MacRoberts said police seized less than 1.5 ounces of marijuana and two guns from the home. Pennie Yepez said she was not home during the raid. Her son was upstairs sleeping when police kicked in the front door about 7 a.m. and threw flash grenades, she said. The dog was sleeping on the couch by the front door, and, after police entered, the dog moved away from the door. &quot;He was in the kitchen and (police) shot him three times,&quot; she said. Pennie Yepez said the family had Nastradamus&#039; body examined by a local veterinarian with x-rays to view the full scope of his injuries. She said there was a visible bullet hole in the dog&#039;s neck, unexplained leg injuries and several broken bones.','http://www.fayobserver.com/articles/2012/09/21/1205829/?sac=fo.local','Nastradamus','Unknown SWAT team','No','No',0,0,0,'Yes','Yes','Uniform','Yes','Not Sure','Not Sure','Not Sure','Not Sure','Not Sure'),(95,'2013-04-09','South Carolina','Myrtle Beach','Horry County Police Department',1,100,0,'Retriever','Victim Hayden 10 year old retriever. A Myrtle Beach area woman, whose dog was shot and killed by an Horry County police officer, said her dog was not an aggressive animal. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an absolute tragedy and it should have never happened,&rdquo; said Christine Orlando, whose dog, Hayden, a 10-year-old rescue retriever was killed Tuesday morning when police were called to her apartment for a civil dispute. &ldquo;He started nipping at one of the officer&rsquo;s feet. That&rsquo;s what he does. That&rsquo;s his way of saying just back up. Not in a threatening way. He never lunged,&rdquo; Orlando said Thursday morning. &ldquo;He had never done any harm to anyone in his life. He was one of the most amazing animals. He did not need to die.&rdquo; Horry County police were called about 5:15 a.m. Tuesday to an apartment at 913 Marshfield Circle for a civil complaint between two roommates regarding electricity being turned off, according to the report. The dog&rsquo;s owner was arguing with her roommate because he shut off the power to their apartment.\r\nWhen the officer&rsquo;s arrived, one officer knocked on the door and heard a dog barking, according to the report. When the dog owner opened the door, the black retriever, weighing about 100 pounds, charged out into the breezeway and attacked one of the officers, according to the report. The report stated the dog bit the other officer&rsquo;s foot, while he yelled for the woman to get her dog, but the dog continued and ignored &ldquo;any verbal or physical attempts of the complaint to restrain it,&rdquo; according to the report. The officer tried to draw his gun, but was unable to do so because the woman &ldquo;pushed down on his holster,&rdquo; according to the report. Another officer asked the woman to restrain her dog and the dog briefly ran back into the open door of the apartment. Then it ran back out into the breezeway. One of the officers used his gun and shot the dog once in the head, which killed it, according to the report. The officers did not suffer any injuries during the incident and they called Horry County Environmental Services to take the dog for proper disposal. Horry County police Sgt. Robert Kegler said the incident was not under investigation. Orlando disputed the account in the police report and said she argued with her roommate about some money due on Thursday, so he shut off the power to the apartment. Orlando said instead of continuing the argument, she called police. The apartment was dark and Orlando said she was unaware her dog followed her from her bedroom when she went to answer the door for police. Orlando said her dog did not return to the apartment and she did not grab at an officer&rsquo;s gun. &ldquo;There was a lot of yelling involved with the officers, which heightened the circumstance,&rdquo; Orlando said and noted her dog took note of the officer drawing his gun. &ldquo;I immediately acted on impulse and jumped in front of the officer and begged please do not shoot my dog. . . As soon as a he had a clear shot, he shot my dog in the head.&rdquo; Orlando said no blood was drawn and the officer&rsquo;s uniforms were not damaged by her dog nipping at their feet. &ldquo;My dog never returned back into that house. The only time my dog turned to come back into the house was when he came back in to die. I never pushed anybody&rsquo;s gun back into the holster,&rdquo; Orlando said. &ldquo;This is just insane.

There was a puddle of blood on the floor and bullet holes in the door of a bedroom where Prada slept. But it was not a burglar who broke in. Hairston found a search warrant, signed by a judge, issued to the Erie County Sheriff&#039;s Department, on her kitchen floor.

Hairston said she rents another home she owns to Thompson, who dates her daughter, but he does not live in her residence and she has absolutely no connection to his alleged illegal activities. A spokesperson for the sheriff&#039;s office said they had probable cause to search Hairston&#039;s residence because Thompson&#039;s alleged drug activities were suspected to take place from Hairston&#039;s house on occasion.

Patton was shot in front of his owners James Smoak and his wife, Pamela and 17-year-old son Brandon, all of whom were handcuffed and ordered onto their knees. The family was stopped in relationship to a robbery that they had no involvement with. The event was caught on video. The tape shows the Smoaks pleaded with officers to close the doors of their car so their two dogs would not escape, but the officers did not heed them.\r\n\r\nPamela Smoak is seen on the tape looking up at an officer, telling him slowly, &quot;That dog is not mean. He won&#039;t hurt you.&quot;\r\n\r\nHer husband says, &quot;I got a dog in the car. I don&#039;t want him to jump out.&quot; The tape then shows the Smoaks&#039; medium-size brown dog romping on the shoulder of the Interstate, its tail wagging. As the family yells, the dog, named Patton, first heads away from the road, then quickly circles back toward the family.\r\nAn officer in a blue uniform aims his shotgun at the dog and fires at its head, killing it immediately. Patton made no aggressive or furtive movements toward the officer who killed him. A federal court jury in 2008 awarded the family 9K in compensatory damages and 192K in attorneys fees, and the Smoaks settled with the City of Cookeville for 77,500 dollars in a separate lawsuit. After the Smoaks settled with the City of Cookeville, their lawsuit against the THP officers remained. The troopers argued in court that they were entitled to qualified immunity for their actions that day, and though a Tennessee district court denied them that status, they appealed, and a higher court granted it. But the higher court also found that Bush and Trooper Lt. Jerry Andrews did use excessive force against the handcuffed man that day. Since then, the case has been slowly making its way through the appeals court system, and a jury concluded that Andrews did not use excessive force that day, but that Bush did. Bush appealed that decision, and the latest ruling is a denial of that appeal. Noting that a jury has already ruled that Bush used excessive force that day and that essentially, no new evidence to the contrary has been presented, the 6th Circuit ruling says that Bush is asking us to do what the law flatly forbids to substitute our opinion for that of the jury based on a re-weighing and reinterpreting of the evidence.

It all started at a home on the 4900 block of Bell Street in Fort Myers. That&#039;s where police responded to a call for help Monday night. &quot;It was a call to burglary in progress and possibly a sexual assault that had occurred,&quot; said Capt. Jim Mulligan, Fort Myers Police Department. When officers arrived they found a woman screaming someone was in the house with a gun. As they tried to go inside, three large pit bulls rushed them at the door. &quot;One officer, fearing that he was in jeopardy from the dog biting him, drew his weapon and fired one round striking one of the dogs,&quot; Mulligan said. It was a quick decision Mulligan says the officers are trained to make. &quot;He&#039;s there to protect himself the other officers and whoever else if the dog happens to run past him so its about protecting himself first because the dog is bearing down on him and he doesn&#039;t want to get hurt,&quot; Mulligan said. We tried the residence to see if anyone would talk to us about what happened, but no one was home. In the end, officers arrested the man they found inside the house. Officers say he was carrying a loaded gun and he was later Baker Acted. After he was taken into custody he told cops his dogs were trained to attack. The other two dogs are now with Lee County Animal Services. Officials say it&#039;s too early to tell their temperaments. The shelter will be their new home until they can be evaluated and possibly put up for adoption. We looked up some stats on how often Fort Myers officers discharge their weapons.

The incident was witnessed by numerous bystanders, some of whom questioned the lethal tactics taken by police. The animal barked and growled when approached but attacked no one, they said. &quot;To me &mdash; I felt like it was scared more than anything,&quot; said Randy Schamber, an employee of the Hager Parking Lot where the incident occurred around 4:30 p.m.\r\n&quot;I feel like (police) could&#039;ve done more to catch the dog. I don&#039;t understand why they had to shoot it.&quot; Police, however, said the animal was shot only after all other efforts had failed. Officers tried placing a snare around the dog&#039;s neck and attempted to subdue the animal with a Taser. Both efforts failed and only seemed to make the animal more agitated, Sgt. Bill Hickey said Wednesday night.\r\n&quot;In that moment, the officer felt he wasn&#039;t able to control the situation and believed the dog to be a danger,&quot; Hickey added. He declined to release the name of the officer, stating that an internal review will be conducted to determine if the use of force was justified. Hickey said police responded to the West King Street lot for a report of a loose dog that had chased people and another dog.\r\nWitnesses said the animal didn&#039;t go after anyone. They said the white pit bull had jumped from the partially-covered bed of a pickup truck that was parked in the lot. Schamber said the animal and another dog, which one witness said appeared to be a spaniel-type, had been in the back of the truck for at least a half-hour. He said the animals got his attention because the white dog would bark when people walked by the vehicle. After jumping from the truck, the pit bull ran toward a man who had just gotten out of an SUV with his dog. The pit bull ran up to the man&#039;s dog but didn&#039;t attack the animal, Schamber said. The man, who lives nearby, scooped up his medium-sized dog and placed it back in his vehicle, inside a dog crate. The pit bull then jumped in the back of the SUV as well.\r\n&quot;Not necessarily at (my dog), just jumped in the car &mdash; but if you tried to get close to him he&#039;d growl. But I think by this time the dog is really confused,&quot; the resident, who asked that his name not be used, said. &quot;We tried to get him out of the car,&quot; said Schamber. &quot;I keep dog treats in the booth so I ran over and got some to try to coax him out.&quot; The dog jumped from the vehicle, only to bark and growl at the men.\r\nThat&#039;s when Schamber called police.\r\n&quot;The Fulton (Theater) was letting out and there were elderly people walking through the lot. (The dog) hadn&#039;t gone after anyone but I didn&#039;t want to risk the possibility,&quot; he said. For the next several minutes, until police arrived, the animal went back and forth from his owner&#039;s truck to the resident&#039;s SUV.\r\n&quot;He couldn&#039;t get back in his own truck but it seemed like he wanted to,&quot; Schamber said. &quot;He would keep walking over and looking up. Then he&#039;d go over and jump in the back of the other car again.&quot; The dog was in the back of the resident&#039;s SUV when police arrived.\r\n&quot;He&#039;s not scowling or growling but this one cop has a rifle and he&#039;s threatening to shoot that white dog next to (the resident&#039;s) dog in the back of the car,&quot; according to Meredith Wilterdink, who works at the nearby Carr&#039;s Restaurant.\r\nThe resident refused to allow the officer to fire, refusing the officer&#039;s command to move away from the car, Wilterdink said. Police eventually placed the resident in handcuffs but he later was released with no charges filed. The pit bull eventually jumped from the SUV at which time police unsuccessfully tried to subdue the animal with a Taser. Moments later, according to Schamber, a shot rang out.\r\n&quot;The dog was running around yelping, and then a second shot,&quot; Schamber said as his eyes welled with tears. &quot;I don&#039;t understand why they had to shoot him; he didn&#039;t hurt anybody.&quot; &quot;He didn&#039;t need to be shot,&quot; the resident said adamantly. &quot;What he needed was to be tethered and maybe tranquilized. But shot ... no.&quot;\r\nRegarding the use of a tranquilizer gun, Hickey said he wasn&#039;t sure if city police still had one. &quot;In the past I believe we did. That said, it&#039;s something that&#039;s kept under lock and key. It&#039;s not something you grab and go in the heat of the moment.&quot; He also said the department&#039;s dog law officer, who typically would&#039;ve responded to Wednesday&#039;s incident, had gone off duty about 30 minutes prior to the incident. &quot;There were a lot of factors here &mdash; rush hour in downtown, a busy street, a public parking lot &mdash; that made for an unfortunate outcome,&quot; Hickey said. &quot;We&#039;re dog owners too and nobody takes this sort of thing lightly. &quot;Yes, shooting the animal is an option but it&#039;s not the one any of us prefer. It&#039;s a last resort.&quot; The owner of the deceased animal returned to his vehicle after the incident had concluded.

Russ Boring with the Springfield Police Department said officers received a 911 call from a resident near 41st and Camellia in Springfield around 6:15 p.m. The caller reported a pit bull acting aggressively in the neighborhood and running around the street unleashed. Boring said the caller told police that the pit bull was acting in a threatening manner towards a young boy. &quot;It was aggressive enough to where there was a gentleman driving down the street who was honking his horn on his car, who placed his car between the dog and the boy, and ended up having the boy get in his car and drove him away from the scene,&quot; Boring said. An officer responded to the scene. According to Boring, the officer tried to coax the dog back into the home where it came from. At first the dog was friendly, Boring said, but then it became more aggressive as the officer tried to get it back on the property. Boring said the pit bull &quot;growled, it snarled, it showed it&#039;s teeth and it became pretty aggressive.&quot; As the dog approached the officer, Boring said the officer believed he was in danger. &quot;He had to make a decision right there,&quot; he said. &quot;I don&#039;t think a Taser would have been effective with this aggressive behavior and this dog. I mean, he felt that he was going to be attacked.&quot; The officer shot the dog once in the head as other officers responded. &quot;The dog was basically at his feet when he shot the dog,&quot; he said. The dog survived. Breonna Kerr, Kiki&#039;s owner, said the dog is a rescue, and they&#039;ve had it since it was a puppy. The family was out for dinner when a friend called Kerr and otld her the dog broke free from its chain in the backyard and was loose. &quot;I pulled in my driveway and there were 5 or 6 cop cars,&quot; Kerr recalled, &quot;and my dog was cornered in my driveway and she had blood, like a gunshot to her head.&quot; \r\nPolice and Kerr took Kiki to the vet. The veterinarian who treated Kiki called where the bullet lodged &quot;somewhat of a miracle for this dog.&quot; Kiki didn&#039;t have a heavy active hemmorage and was discharged as stable patient who had received treatment, said Dr. Meg Schneck with the Emergency Veterinary Hospital.\r\nThe hospital donated services for treatment of the dog prior to discharge on Tuesday, she said. Schneck explained that she wouldn&#039;t propose surgery to remove the bullet. She said her &quot;recommendation is to leave it alone.&quot;\r\nTo remove the bullet, Schneck said a vet would have to use a bone saw and cut into fragile structures in the dog&#039;s head. Even leaving the bullet in place, she recommended antibiotics and pain medications. Kerr said her family doesn&#039;t have the money for Kiki&#039;s care. &quot;There&#039;s a chance that she could have to be put down or die from it,&quot; she said. \r\nKerr said they understand police officers need to protect themselves, but the family thinks the force was a little too excessive. &quot;People said she was trying to get back inside.

East Peoria Police shot and killed that dog, Bella, an eight-year-old pit bull last week. The dog allegedly attacked two people and charged at an officer. Now more than 2,500 people have signed a petition demanding justice for the dog. &ldquo;She loved people. She loved attention. She was a really happy dog,&rdquo; said dog owner Shane Ellis. That&rsquo;s how Shane Ellis described Bella, his pit bull that was shot and killed by an East Peoria Police officer August 21st. He and a friend started a Facebook page and an online petition calling for an investigation of the shooting. &ldquo;I hope we get justice. Cause I do not think it&#039;s right.&rdquo; Police didn&#039;t want to talk about the issue on camera, but according to their report, here&#039;s what happened. On the afternoon of August 21st an East Peoria officer responded to a call of two dogs running loose in the Quail Trail area. The officer found two people- one limping and one bleeding from the leg- saying they were bit by a dog. He was told both dogs belong to Ellis so he parked outside the owner&#039;s home and waited for animal control. The two pit bulls returned as he was questioning one of the bite victims. They circled the officer before heading towards Ellis&#039;s home. That&#039;s when a neighbor, two doors up the road, walked out of his house and headed towards his car. The Police Report says one of the dogs, Bella, started walking toward the neighbor. After the officer yelled at the neighbor to &quot;watch out&quot; the dog turned toward the officer, growled and started running at him. Bella got less than 10-yards from the officer when he fired those fatal shots. &ldquo;They just got a call and seen my dog and thought it was it.&rdquo; Ellis believes another neighbor&rsquo;s pit bull was responsible for attacking two people, not his dog. &ldquo;I think it was a mistaken identity.&rdquo; But according to police reports, witnesses recognized Bella by a large tumor on her backside. Ellis tells us he secures his dogs behind a chain linked fence. &ldquo;They do occasionally get out, but most generally I guess they&rsquo;re put up,&quot; says another neighbor.And whether it was Bella biting people or not, one neighbor just asks one thing\r\n&ldquo;To see my neighborhood safe.

James Clark says he plans to file a formal complaint against the two police officers who were captured on video using force on his two barking dogs. Clark told the station he wasn&#039;t home when one of his Labrador retrievers, Max, got out of his yard and was reported to be chasing children at a nearby school. When officers arrived, a neighbor captured one of them on video shooting Max with a bean bag. &quot;My heart broke. My heart still breaks every time I hear him whimper,&quot; Clark said. &quot;You know, it&#039;s like my son here falling and getting hurt.&quot; Police say the video only tells part of the story. &quot;The officers acted very appropriately. They kept that dog from hurting them,&quot; West Covina police Lt. Ken Plunkett said, according to the station. Because the camera is so shaky, only the audio of the bean-bag shot going off can be heard, he said. The video viewer does not show the moments leading up to it. &quot;At that point, that&#039;s when the dog became aggressive and charged at him,&quot; Lt. Plunkett said. Witnesses, however, say the dogs were not being as aggressive as police claim. &quot;He was barking but not like all dramatic,&quot; witness Anna Estrada said, according to the station. &quot; &#039;Ruff, ruff.&#039; Like a dog would bark. It was a normal bark...I think the cop was being more dramatic, calling more attention on himself.&quot; After Max was shot with the bean bag, police say the officers tried to get him back in the yard, where his sister Chloe was barking behind the fence. The video also shows one of the officers using a fire extinguisher on Chloe. While watching the video, the dog owner, Clark points out where the officers use the fire extinguisher. &quot;He sprays her.

Ms. Shimburski&rsquo;s parents, John Shimburski and Martha Spaulding, were not at home when the day turned to chaos.

Ms. Shimburski said that she looked out the window and saw two vehicles parked outside &mdash; a car and an SUV &mdash; along with unidentified men, one of whom had a gun drawn. Panicked, she rushed outside toward danger to attend to her daughter, Makenna, who was accompanied by &ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; a 2-year-old Brindle Pit Bull.

(Source: Megan Shimburski)\r\n&ldquo;I heard 2 shots fired, and Lady yelp, and my daughter scream,&rdquo; Ms. Shimburski told Police State USA. The armed stranger had just shot the family&rsquo;s beloved pet in the head, with Makenna standing &ldquo;20 feet behind [the dog] in the exact same direction.&rdquo; &ldquo;He then proceeded to continue walking up the hill with his gun raised, and I screamed at him not to shoot his gun again,&rdquo; she added. Ms. Shimburski says that there was no clear indication of who the intruders were; there were no markings on the vehicles and the three men were not in uniforms. She described them as dressed in &ldquo;business attire&rdquo; &mdash; definitely not uniforms. &ldquo;I stated that I was going to call the police, and that&rsquo;s when they said, &lsquo;We are the Erie County Police,&rsquo;&rdquo; Ms. Shimburski recalled. The men began then began to request to enter her parents&rsquo; home. Ms. Shimburski declined, and tended to her children and dogs. Lady was bleeding profusely. Makenna was cowering nearby crying, &ldquo;The man shot Lady. He shot my dog.&rdquo; As Ms. Shimburski took her daughter inside, she discovered that two of the self-described &ldquo;officers&rdquo; had already entered her parents&rsquo; home, after she had explicitly told them to stay out. &ldquo;They were yelling at me to tell my daughter it was OK,&rdquo; she said. The young mom secured her daughter in a bedroom along with the second dog that had been indoors. Her parents quickly arrived after being notified about what had happened. The reason for the intrusion was finally made known when they announced that they were looking for the father of Ms. Shimburski&rsquo;s son. The family told the officers that the man they were seeking had never lived there, didn&rsquo;t receive mail at the address, and that they should have tried looking for him at his own home. The police had not brought a warrant, and said they only wanted to ask the man some questions. They continued to request a search of the home. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to GRAZE her.&rdquo;\r\nMeanwhile Lady, described as a &ldquo;67-pound big baby,&rdquo; was hiding under the deck, covered in blood. A bullet had traveled through the tissue on her head, neck, and shoulder. A large, open gash allowed blood to pour down her face into her eyes and nose. It was a shocking sight for the family. &ldquo;The officer stated that he had just &lsquo;grazed&rsquo; her, and that she would be fine,&rdquo; Ms. Shimburski recalled. &ldquo;I looked at him and said, &lsquo;You did not graze her!!&rsquo; His words were, &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to GRAZE her.&rsquo;&rdquo; The shooter &mdash; [later identified as Erie County Sheriff&#039;s Detective Greg McCarthy] &mdash; claimed he shot in self-defense because the dog was &ldquo;charging and barking.&rdquo; Ms. Shimburski says that he exaggerated the dog&rsquo;s actions and the distance he was standing from her when he fired.  No one was bitten or in danger, she said, and the dog was coming from the back to the front of the house to investigate the strange visitors. &ldquo;My child could have been shot,&rdquo; Ms. Shimburski said to Police State USA. &ldquo;She now has the idea that these people who were there to protect people are bad people,&rdquo; and added that she may need counseling. &ldquo;I stated that not all cops are bad but at this point I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s going to trust them.&rdquo; Lady ultimately survived, after an emergency surgery, 60 metal stitches, and $1,200.00 in veterinarian bills. &ldquo;The police did not leave names or numbers, nor did they show any remorse,&rdquo; Ms. Shimburski said. In fact, she had been left with no paperwork; no business card; no record whatsoever of what had happened. Regardless, the family attempted to get past the incident.  Young Makenna dealt with confused feelings about the shooting and Lady slowly recovered from her injuries at home.  Ms. Shimburski did not even have a confirmed phone number to call regarding the incident.  Until 11 days later&hellip; A &ldquo;Dangerous Animal&rdquo;\r\nThe family found that their troubles were not yet over on August 5th, when police returned for another visit.  This time, they brought paperwork: a document that read &ldquo;Order to Seize Dog.&rdquo; The Erie County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office, unsatisfied that Lady had survived the first encounter, had sought out another legal method of killing her.  Describing Lady as &ldquo;dangerous dog &mdash; pit bull,&rdquo; the document authorized deputies to &ldquo;seize the said dog harbored by the said Megan Shimburski&rdquo; and to &ldquo;hold, care for, or dispose of&rdquo; Lady, pursuant to New York&rsquo;s Agriculture and Markets Law, Article 7, Section 123. The deputy and an animal control officer took Lady away to the animal warden, leaving her with an uncertain fate.  Pending a court date on August 12th, Lady may be euthanized if found to be a &ldquo;dangerous dog.&rdquo; The document was signed by Gene R. Heintz, Justice of the Town of Sardina.  It also confirms that the men at the property on July 25th were Erie County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office detectives Graham, Noecher, and McCarthy.  The man who shot Lady was Detective Greg McCarthy. &ldquo;I am outraged and disgusted by their behavior,&rdquo; Ms. Shimburski said in an interview.  &ldquo;They put my child&rsquo;s life in danger because of their negligence.  Lady did not deserve this in any way because she is not in any way a dangerous or aggressive dog.&rdquo;  Police returned to the residence to seize Lady, the detectives declaring her a dangerous dog and ordering her to be euthanized. At Ladys court hearing, the Judge declared Lady to in fact be dangerous. The ruling forces the family to keep Lady in a muzzle, posts signs at their home warning visitors of Ladys dangerous dog status, and other penalties and requirements. The Shimburski family attorney, Matt Albert, was nearly held in contempt of court after he admittedly mouthed off to the judge because he upset with how the hearing unfolded.','http://www.policestateusa.com/2014/justice-for-lady-erie-county-ny/','Lady','Det Greg McCarthy Det Graham and Det Noecher','Yes','Yes',1,0,0,'No','Yes','Plain Clothes','No','Not Sure','Not Sure','Not Sure','Not Sure','Not Sure'),(139,'2014-08-27','Kansas','Hutchinson','Hutchinson City Police Department',1,2,1,'Unconfirmed','The following is based entirely on an uncorroborated police statement: Hutchinson police officer shot and killed a pit bull Wednesday that had already bitten another officer and then appeared to charge the officer who shot it.

He said the officer watched him tie Arzy to a nearby fence with a 3 1/2-foot leash before Thierbach handcuffed both men, ordered them to the ground facing away from Arzy, and asked, &quot;Is this dog going to bite me or attack me?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; Carpenter said he responded. &quot;He is an incredibly friendly dog.&quot; Twenty seconds later, Carpenter told HuffPost, he heard a single shot. Eric Midkiff, Southwest Daily News circulation manager, said his boss phoned him around 7 a.m., asking if he knew anything about the men in the parking lot. Midkiff &quot;took off&quot; and headed to the office, and by the time he arrived, &quot;the officer already had Brandon and the other guy on the ground.&quot; Midkiff, 33, told HuffPost he stayed about 20 feet from the men, and heard Thierbach asking if the dog was going to attack. Midkiff said Thierbach was standing on the bumper of the box truck petting Arzy. &quot;The dog was rubbing up against the cop,&quot; Midkiff said. &quot;He would rub the dog&#039;s back and then push him away. All of a sudden, he just jumped down and shot the dog in the head.&quot; Midkiff said he could see both Thierbach and the dog clearly. &quot;That dog did not bite that officer,&quot; he said. &quot;The dog was wagging his tail, his tongue was hanging out.&quot; Carpenter said he spun around when he heard the gunshot. &quot;I see my dog kind of start shaking and batting at his head,&quot; he said. &quot;I saw the blood start to run down his face. &hellip; I&#039;m watching my dog die while I&#039;m sitting in cuffs.&quot; Thierbach, Carpenter told HuffPost, &quot;seemed to be fighting back a smile.&quot; He said he asked the cop why he was smiling, and that Thierbach &quot;smirked&quot; and replied, &quot;Well, he nipped at my foot.&quot; Backup officers put Arzy&#039;s body in a trash bag and threw it into the back of a vehicle, Carpenter said. According to the Southwest Daily News, police charged Carpenter and Laliberte with trespassing and kept them in jail for a few hours.\r\nMidkiff said he watched as other officers questioned Thierbach about the shooting. Within about 15 minutes, he said, Thierbach&#039;s story changed. He first claimed to have been bitten on the calf, then on the back of his heel. Later, another officer took a photograph of his toe. A Sulphur Police Department public information officer told the Southwest Daily News that the department has launched an internal investigation. The department did not return a request for comment from The Huffington Post.','http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/08/brian-thierbach-quits-cop-shot-dog-arzy-brandon-carpenter_n_5289294.html','Arzy Kensington','Brian Thierbach','Yes','No',0,0,0,'Yes','Yes','Uniform','NA','NA','Yes','Yes','Not \r\nSure','Yes'),(144,'2014-04-18','Texas','Unincorporated Rains County','Rains County Sheriffs Department',1,30,0,'Blue Healer','Owners name Cole Middleton and wife Jayna, a third generation dairy East Texas farmer.

Owners Ryan and Toni Walker. \r\nThe sheriff&rsquo;s office received a call of dogs, belonging to Ryan and Toni Walker, running loose and on a neighbor&rsquo;s property in the area of the 22000 block of FM 1541. In May one of the Walkers&rsquo; other dogs had bitten a 16-year-old boy who lived in the complaining party&rsquo;s residence. Upon leaving the Walker&rsquo;s home, the investigating deputy, John Vaught, shot and killed a charging dog, an Australian Shepherd named Blue, at the Walker&rsquo;s residence in the front yard. &ldquo;This was an unfortunate incident, and I want to publicly express my sympathy and condolences to the dog&rsquo;s owners, Ryan and Toni Walker, as I know they considered Blue to be a member of their family,&rdquo; Richardson said. &ldquo;After reviewing the discharge of a firearm report, I have decided to change our policy regarding canine encounters. The new policy will be in effect after review by legal counsel. It will outline some specific actions and strategies that should help officers avoid using deadly force against canines.&rdquo;\r\nBecause deputies frequently come into contact with dogs each day, from making traffic stops, serving warrants and conducting interviews, Jim Osorio of Canine Encounters Law Enforcement Training of Arlington will conduct a training Oct. 13-14 at the Randall County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office. Osorio&rsquo;s program includes factors contributing to a dog bite, types of aggressive dogs, dog body language, encountering dogs on the job, report writing, use of force continuum, tools of the trade and self-defense against dogs. &ldquo;This training will give officers option and strategies in dealing with aggressive and dangerous dogs and the tools on how to best deescalate these situations,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It will also provide our officers with knowledge and tactics so they can better protect themselves, the citizens we serve and the dogs that officers encounter.&rdquo; Richardson said that the Facebook page &ldquo;Justice for Blue&rdquo; contains false statements regarding the incident. Because of those statements, Richardson showed the dash camera video from the incident to press during the conference. &ldquo;Specific statements indicating that the dog was &lsquo;shot just for barking&rsquo; and that a &lsquo;child was endangered&rsquo; by the shots that were fired, are both inaccurate,&rdquo; Richardson said. When Vaught arrived at the complainant&rsquo;s house, the dogs were no longer there, according to a copy of the incident report provided by the Randall County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office. The deputy then went to the Walkers&rsquo; home, and when he attempted to exit the vehicle two dogs appeared with one charging aggressively, according to the report. Vaught reported that he used pepper spray to protect himself, but it &ldquo;had little effect on the dog.&rdquo; He wrote that once he made contact with Toni Walker, the two dogs &ldquo;became very friendly.&rdquo; The law states that dogs can run unconfined and without leashes if the owners provide a plot of land of at least 5 acres. The Walkers&rsquo; property meets that requirement, but a violation still occurs if the dogs leave the property, Richardson said. The video shows the officer coming out the home, veer out the frame to avoid going near the dog, which was under a parked vehicle. The dog runs toward the officer, which is when shots were fired. However, the officer using his firearm cannot be seen in the video. Richardson said the officer fired five times and shot the dog twice. Toni Walker then comes out of the home holding a small child. Richardson said the dog was still alive, but Walker asked the officer to shoot Blue once more to humanely kill the animal.\r\n&ldquo;The next inaccuracy on the Facebook page is that I provided an &lsquo;edited&rsquo; version of the dash camera footage to the Walkers. Be design the dash camera footage cannot be edited, or it would be of no evidentiary value,&rdquo; Richardson said.\r\nIn the video Toni Walker can be heard apologizing for being extremely upset, to which the officer replies that he understands. Before leaving the scene, Vaught can be heard asking Walker if she would like him to move the dog. She responded that she wanted to move him, and then asked Vaught to hold her 7-month-old son. Walker can then be seen picking up the dog and carrying it behind the home while Vaught follows her with the baby. Vaught then provided Walker with a card for the sheriff&rsquo;s office should she need anything or have other concerns. &ldquo;The question isn&rsquo;t whether or not this was a justified use of force; the question is &lsquo;was it avoidable.&rsquo; My answer to that question is yes,&rdquo; Richardson said. Richardson said he was saddened by the incident, especially witnessing on the video a very upset Toni Walker carry Blue behind the house. He also said that he offered to buy the Walkers&rsquo; a new dog, but was told their other dog was pregnant with puppies fathered by Blue. Richardson said he went to the Walkers&rsquo; home and gave Toni Walker a $500 check to cover veterinary expenses. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been pretty blasted over that, but I did it out of the goodness of my heart,&rdquo; Richardson said. The Walkers have stated they have no intention on cashing the check, but are looking into acquiring legal counsel.','http://www.myplainview.com/canyon/c_top_stories/article_14e54b22-2245-11e4-84ae-001a4bcf887a.html','Blue','John Vaught','No','No',1,0,0,'No','Not Sure','Uniform','Yes','Not Sure','No','No','Not \r\nSure','No'),(146,'2014-07-27','Missouri','Columbia','Howard County Sheriff Department',1,50,1,'Pit Bull','Victim King pitbull mix, shot with a 12 gauge shotgun.

A Howard County police officer shot and fatally wounded a pit bull in late February, upsetting the dog&#039;s owner, who said the shooting was not necessary.\r\nHoward County police, however, say the dog not only approached an officer aggressively, but charged toward him as well. &quot;I&#039;m a nervous wreck,&quot; said the dog&#039;s owner, Patty Wynston, a 71-year-old who lives in the 9200 block of Whiskey Bottom Road. &quot;She was my dog. She slept with me every night.&quot; Police were called Feb. 26 to Whiskey Bottom Road for reports of two pit bulls running loose. When they got to the owner&#039;s home, the dogs were inside, according to police spokeswoman Sherry Llewellyn. Wynston said the pit bulls, an 8-year-old named Yayo and Yayo&#039;s daughter, 3-year-old Pebbles, had accidentally gotten out earlier. She said police asked Wynston to leash the dogs and bring them out, but she didn&#039;t have enough time to do so before officers again knocked on her door &quot;The doors went open,&quot; Wynston said, &quot;and of course the dogs went out.&quot; Police said that an officer was approaching the home when one of the dogs charged out of the house toward the officer, barking aggressively. &quot;The officer backed away from the dog, which continued to charge and gain speed,&quot; Llewellyn said. &quot;When the dog was approximately three feet from the officer, he drew his weapon and fired at the dog, wounding it.&quot; That pit bull was Yayo, who later had to be euthanized. Wynston said Yayo &quot;was walking toward the officer, but she was not aggressive or nothing until he pulled his gun.&quot; The dog, she said, &quot;wasn&#039;t an aggressive dog, but when people came in our yard, even if she knew them, she&#039;d bark.&quot; Police said their records show neither dog as being licensed or vaccinated, and that Yayo&#039;s license had been revoked in Howard County in 2008. The dog was sent to New York to live with a family member, and there was no record of her having been re-licensed in the county, Llewellyn said. Police policy allows officers to fire their weapons at an animal if doing so will prevent the officer or another person from substantial harm, or if an animal is so badly injured that shooting it will keep it from suffering any further, Llewellyn said. Wynston&#039;s other dog was allowed to stay at the home, as officers did not see them running loose, Llewellyn said. A citation was issued for failure to license and vaccinate the dog. Wynston says Yayo has been cremated and her ashes are now on the mantle. &quot;I was very attached to her,&quot; she said.','http://www.baltimoresun.com/explore/howard/news/crime/ph-ho-cf-dog-shooting-0315-20120313,0,5655392.story','Yayo','Unknown','Not \r\nSure','No',0,0,0,'No','Yes','Uniform','NA','Not Sure','No','No','Not \r\nSure','No'),(148,'2014-07-23','Texas','Cedar Park','Cedar Park Police Department',1,2,1,'Mixed Breed 10yo','Victim is repeatedly reported as a pitbull or pitbull mix following statements by police.

She was inside the house when one of her sons told her police were pulling up the driveway. She said by the time she reached the front door, she heard two shots fired. She said she was immediately worried about her children playing outside. Then she realized one of her family&#039;s dogs had been shot by officers. &quot;I tried to gather the kids up to put them in the house because apparently you&#039;re not safe outside with officers where we should be because they&#039;re protecting and serve,&quot; Best said. &quot;If you show up with a gun and you&#039;re irate, then you&#039;re not protecting me so I did not feel safe.&quot; Within moments, she found out why police were at her house. They were investigating a cell phone stolen from T.L. Hanna High School. The report was initiated by the school&#039;s resource officer, who is an Anderson County deputy.\r\nThe phone had been tracked by GPS to Best&#039;s house and was being carried by a friend of her son&#039;s, who told her he had found it at school. The school resource officer called for back-up from Anderson police because the East Franklin Street is in the city. A spokesman for the Anderson County Sheriff&#039;s Office said the resource officer was not on scene yet when the dog was shot. FOX Carolina called the Anderson Police Department, who provided an incident report of the dog shooting. It was written by Officer Joseph Chapman. Part of the report said, &quot;A brown and white large dog charged myself and Captain Aman. Officers did draw duty issue weapons and felt in fear that the dog was going to attack, due to the threatening manner it was coming at officers. Captain Aman did shoot the dog with one shot, at which time the dog went into some bushes and was not a threat.&quot; But the family gave a different story, calling their dog a gentle giant. Adrian Gaines, one of Best&#039;s sons, was in the driveway when he saw officers arrive and witnessed the shooting. &quot;The dog didn&#039;t bark, show any teeth, it didn&#039;t rush them, didn&#039;t growl or anything,&quot; Gaines said. &quot;Once he shot him the first time, I&#039;m sure he was scared and that&#039;s how he got up in the bushes and he ran up in the bushes and that&#039;s when you shoot him again. He&#039;s in the bushes bleeding already and you shoot him again.&quot; The shooting of the dog was witnessed by four children, including a 13-year-old named Jeremiah. He cried for hours after the dog was killed. He and others in the family want to know why this happened.\r\n&quot;He was a good dog,&quot; Jeremiah said. &quot;He didn&#039;t deserve to die. They shouldn&#039;t have shot him. There was no point to it.&quot; Now, the family plans to file a formal complaint with Anderson police. In the meantime, the department indicates they did what they had to do to make sure their officers were safe. They said because the dog was not in a fence or tethered, there was no option.

Police said the officer &mdash; a one-year veteran of the force who was not identified &mdash; was canvassing a neighborhood looking for witnesses around 4 p.m. Saturday. When the officer went to a home in 900 block of Lombardee Circle in Glen Burnie the dog &mdash; a male Chesapeake Bay Retriever named Vern &mdash; &quot;confronted&quot; the officer in the front yard, police said. The officer then fired his weapon twice, killing the dog, police said. Tim Reeves &mdash; one of Vern&#039;s owners &mdash; said he had been in the basement of his Pasadena house setting up for a Super Bowl party when his girlfriend called him from upstairs, saying she&#039;d seen a police officer in the front yard. &quot;I said to him &#039;How can I help you, officer?&#039;&quot; Tim Reeves said. &quot;He looked at me and said &#039;I unloaded on your dog.

The Reeves family was not involved in the burglary investigation that brought the officer to their neighborhood. Vern barked and ran toward the officer, prompting the shooting, the family said.

When 8-year-old Zaley, daughter of Mike and Christy Packett, went to bed at night, Raccoon Baby was always beside her. Zaley was taken out of school Friday morning where she is a second grader at Forrest Hunt Elementary School so her parents could tell her the fate of her playmate of six years, Raccoon. Thursday afternoon Raccoon was found dead of a gunshot wound between her eyes in the woods about 150 yards from Mike, Christy and Zaley Packett&#039;s home off Valley View Drive in Forest City. Forest City Police Officer Sean Brooks, who also lives on Valley View Drive, was placed on paid suspension from his duties regarding shooting the neighbor&#039;s dog while off-duty. \r\nBrooks has been an officer with the Forest City Police Department since January 2013. Today he awaits news from a mid-week meeting with Forest City Police Chief Jay Jackson, District Attorney Brad Greenway and detectives regarding the shooting and any charges. According to Jackson, Brooks admitted shooting the six-year-old boxer and said it was &quot;in self-defense of his family and wife.&quot; However, there was no police incident report of any dog being aggressive and no police report was filed of shooting an animal inside city limits, which is unlawful. Another staff member at the Forest City Police Department learned from Mike the dog was missing. Mike had filed a report and also offered a reward for Raccoon&#039;s return. On Thursday afternoon the staff member put the case together and Mike was called to meet police officers in a wooded area near his house. Mike said he met them about 150 yards from his house. Raccoon was in a bag. \r\n&quot;I asked them if that was my dog. They told me he had been shot between the eyes,&quot; Mike said. &quot;Why would somebody shoot this kind gentle soul? There is no reason for this.&quot; &quot;He was an off duty officer, used his own personal weapon and said the dog was aggressive with him . . . he never came to us to tell us he had to shoot my dog,&quot; Mike said. Raccoon went missing at about 3 p.m. Wednesday after she and the family&#039;s other bulldog, Dufus, had been playing outdoors. Raccoon didn&#039;t return when she was called, Mike explained. He said that was very unusual so the search for her began. The dogs had just received a bath and Mike did not put their electronic collars on them because they were still wet. For the next 24 hours the dog was missing. Mike said he and others combed their neighborhood covering about 200 acres searching and calling for Raccoon. &quot;The worst part is we went right past them and never once did they tell us,&quot; Mike said of Brooks&#039; family. &quot;We spent a lot of time looking for our dog,&quot; Christy Packett said. Brooks was eventually fired and pled guilty to misdemeanor cruelty to animals and misdemeanor resisting a police officer. District Court Judge Laura Powell sentenced Brooks to 30 days in jail, suspended sentence, unsupervised probation for 12 months, 24 hours of community service within the next 30 days, cost of court and community service fees. Brooks was also ordered by Powell not to have contact with Mike Packett or any member of his family. Owner Mike Packet was charged with violating a town ordinance in Forest City by allowing his dog to run loose. The charge was dismissed, as the dog had run away and was not &quot;allowed&quot; to run loose.

The police chief says the shooting was justified, but the family says the action was excessive and unnecessary. Four-year-old Kenya was a German Shepherd Lab mix. She&#039;s been known to roam her Irmo neighborhood from time to time. But her family says she&#039;s never gone far and never hurt anyone. &quot;She&#039;s probably gotten out about three or four times and usually a neighbor comes by [and says] &#039;Hey, your dog&#039;s in my yard,&#039; and we go get her,&quot; said Kenya&#039;s owner Jared Mann. &quot;It&#039;s never been a big deal.&quot; When her family returned to their Charring Cross Road home after Labor Day fun, Kenya was not there. &quot;We found a note on the front door saying that our dog has been shot by Irmo PD,&quot; said Mann. &quot;We found the blood right after we found the note in our front yard.&quot; Several neighbors say they heard gun shots. &quot;My husband and me were both talking to the police officers that were here,&quot; said the neighbor. &quot;And the one who shot the dog said that she had charged him. But we had seen that dog before in our backyard and she&#039;s never shown any aggression ever.&quot; Irmo Police say they received a call from a jogger who says Kenya chased this person down the street. When officers arrived, the dog was back on its property -- in the front yard, near the steps. Mann says they&#039;ve tried many different methods to restrain Kenya, including building a fence just for the dog and putting in an electrical fence as well. There&#039;s also a chair attached to the back steps, but somehow Kenya escaped. Police say when one of the officers tried to go to the front door to find the owners, the dog charged at him. The officer says he felt threatened by the dog&#039;s aggressive behavior so he fired two shots at the dog. &quot;He charged me,&quot; said the officer in the incident report. &quot;I had to shoot him.&quot; &quot;She was still moving 30 minutes later and I asked if I could take her to the vet and they said no,&quot; said a neighbor. &quot;And that&#039;s when one of the police officers asked the other police officer to get a tarp and just covered her up.&quot; Irmo Police deny that. The report goes on to say the officer fired a third and final shot to &quot;end the dog&#039;s misery.&quot; Family and neighbors do not understand why a gun had to be fired and why the officer killed Kenya. &quot;With the dog being that close to the house, if it was in the middle of the street, it&#039;d be a little bit different I think. But the dog was on its own property so I felt he could have left the dog alone,&quot; said a neighbor. In a statement provided by the jogger, he praises the officer&#039;s candor in regard to the incident. &quot;[He] seemed equally concerned about the dog as he was about the safety of the neighborhood. It was clear that he did not want anyone or the dog to get hurt. He seemed like a true professional in control of the situation,&quot; said the statement. Irmo Police Chief Brian Buck says the officer acted in self-defense. According to an Irmo ordinance, it is illegal for any domestic animal to run at large on the streets or in public places. When asked if the officer could have tasered the dog instead of shooting it, Buck said the officer used the weapon he thought would guarantee his safety.','http://www.wistv.com/story/23324440/irmo-family-unhappy-officer-shot-and-killed-their-dog','Kenya','Unknown','Yes','No',0,0,0,'No','Not Sure','Uniform','NA','NA','No','No','Not \r\nSure','No'),(166,'2013-05-21','Nevada','Las Vegas','Las Vegas Police Department',1,30,0,'Australian Shepherd','Shouting, &ldquo;Justice for Freckles,&rdquo; about a dozen people at the Regional Justice Center on Thursday protested canine killings by Las Vegas police officers. Led by Las Vegan Sarah Hecht, whose 45-pound Australian shepherd hybrid was run down by a two-ton police cruiser earlier this year, the protestors asked for better training for police officers dealing with animals. A police spokeswoman declined to comment on the case because there was an ongoing internal affairs investigation into the incident. The investigation is expected to take several more months. Hecht, 22, was overcome with emotion while speaking of her beloved pet who was a birthday present for getting straight As in high school. An officer told Hecht he purposefully ran over the dog after it had escaped her backyard and was heading toward children playing on May 21. Freckles was dragged by the police cruiser, but lived. Hecht rushed the canine to a veterinarian. The dog licked his owner during the trip. Once there, Hecht made the difficult decision to euthanize the animal. Hecht believes Freckles escaped her backyard after he was taunted by neighborhood children. She insisted her dog would never hurt anyone and had no history of biting humans. While she was at the veterinarian&rsquo;s office, Hecht&rsquo;s father was cited with having an unrestrained dog. Following the protest Thursday, Hecht wept before Las Vegas Justice of the Peace Karen Bennett-Haron as she explained what police had done to her dog and how she had no money left after paying $1,000 to try and save her &ldquo;son&rsquo;s&rdquo; life. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have children.

They discussed what to do, and when the officer offered to put the cat out of its misery, using a night stick was the last thing Wayne expected. &quot;I went inside expecting a gun shot and then I heard it happening on my front porch. I heard at least 15-20 hits,&quot; Wayne says. The officer removed the body, but he had to clean the rest.\r\n&quot;It was nasty to say the least. I was sick to my stomach the whole time doing it.

Media outlets report that a judge found 25-year-old Jonathan Snoddy guilty of the misdemeanor charge Thursday in Rockingham County General District Court. Retired Judge Steven Helvin of Charlottesville ordered Snoddy to pay a $50 fine. Snoddy was charged in January following a Virginia State Police investigation. Resident Wayne Meadows told investigators that he took the cat home on Nov. 11, 2011, after a car hit the animal and called Harrisonburg authorities. Police department policy calls for an officer to euthanize an animal by shooting it, after getting supervisor&#039;s permission.

While doing so a large pit bull aggressively and quickly ran from the house and towards the officers. Noting the dog&rsquo;s aggressive behavior and stance, one of the officers fired several rounds at the animal as it continued approaching them. One of these rounds struck the dog in the rear leg, causing the dog to briefly end its advance and flee towards the house. Officers were then able to retreat and while doing so the dog again began aggressively and quickly approaching the officers. Prior to being forced to discharge their weapon again, the officers were able to close and hold the gate shut until the dog&rsquo;s owner, Patrick Lawrence (a 49 year-old resident of Colorado Springs), was able to contain the animal in a dog crate. During the subsequent investigation, officers were unable to develop probable cause to arrest anyone for the original disturbance call for service but Mr. Lawrence was arrested for possessing a dangerous animal.&rdquo; Lawrence says the only fact he agrees with in the report was that his dog was wounded. &ldquo;If the dog was aggressively trying to get at him, why&rsquo;s the dog shot in the butt?&rdquo; Lawrence asked. Lawrence believes this was a case of a dog protecting its territory.\r\n&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how he do man because he protective, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; Lawrence said.

The dog&rsquo;s body was still there Thursday afternoon when KOB Eyewitness News 4 arrived. Baca said the dog&rsquo;s body was too heavy for her to move. &ldquo;My four year old&rsquo;s response was did they shoot our dog my son walked up the stairs and started shaking her, trying to wake her up,&rdquo; Baca said. Baca was heartbroken and furious demanding answers from police. She said her property clearly has signs warning trespassers of guard dogs and the officer should never have trespassed. &ldquo;I called for help and instead I ended up with the loss of a family member,&rdquo; Baca said. State Police are investigating the shooting but said the officer was simply responding to a call when he hopped the fence. They said he was acting in self defense and there is no training for this kind of situation. &ldquo;Was there things that could have done different? Absolutely however that&rsquo;s the situation that occurred and so now we&rsquo;ll deal with it,&rdquo; said New Mexico State Police spokesman, Lt. Robert McDonald. State police said they sympathize with Baca and apologize to her. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late for an apology. She&rsquo;s gone, an apology isn&rsquo;t going to bring her back,&rdquo; said Baca. State Police said the officer wasn&rsquo;t hurt in the attack and so far there is no cause for disciplinary action. Baca said she is hiring an attorney.','http://www.dogmurderers.com/woman-seeking-attorney-state-police-officer-shoots-dog-video/','Jilly','Unknown','No','No',0,0,0,'No','Not Sure','Uniform','No','Yes','No','No','Not \r\nSure','No'),(174,'2012-09-16','Illinois','El Dorado','Eldorado Police Department and Saline County Sheriffs Office ',1,50,0,'German Sheperd 6yo','Eldorado officer approches wrong house, kills 6-year-old German shepherd','www.dailyamericannews.com/article/20121010/NEWS/121019958/1001/NEWS?template=printart','Smokey','Ryan Ward','Not Sure','No',0,0,0,'No','Not Sure','Uniform','No','Not Sure','Not Sure','No','Not Sure','No'),(175,'2012-09-16','Georgia','Smyrna','Cobb County Police',1,50,0,'Labrador 6yo','Police responding to false alarm for buglary kill 6-year-old chocolate lab.

Shannon Underwood, the teenage daughter of the dogs owner Kathy Sheffield, was breaking the dogs up with sticks. Crank claims that all three dogs were pit bulls. Sheffield reported that the dogs were English Bulldogs. Crank proceeded to use mace on the dogs. Unsatisfied with the results from the Mace, he shot each dog in the head. One of the three dogs was owned by Charvelle Hudson. It is unclear what Hudsons relationship to Sheffield is. Both Sheffield and Hudson arrived on the scene, where Crank advised them that they had violated city ordinances by keeping vicious dogs. The child, Shannon Underwood, had been bit on the hand and leg by the dogs. She was taken to the Medical Center of Southeastern Oklahoma Emergency.

Around 9 p.m., a DeKalb officer went to her home on Silva Court in response to a domestic dispute call with a possibly armed person. The officer said the family&rsquo;s German shepherd lunged at him, so he killed the dog. The recently rescued animal was chained in the garage when the shooting happened. Currie&rsquo;s husband, Anthony, said the officer also pointed his gun at him and told him to put his hands up. &ldquo;I said, &lsquo;Why [did] you shoot my dog?&rsquo; And he said, &lsquo;Well, I&#039;ll blow your brains out.&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;Hold on a minute, you just killed my dog.

The Curries said they don&rsquo;t like what happened but can understand it. &ldquo;Now that I know what he was dealing with and there&#039;s human error, I can understand why it happened,&rdquo; Bobbie Currie said.

City officials fail to enforce existing state and local laws regarding animals. The case involves a Bloomfield police officer, who admitted that on January 21, he trapped Larry, a two-year-old neutered cat who belonged to a local resident, shot him immediately and dumped his body behind a city maintenance shed.&ldquo;The Officer openly admitted this series of events took place, and was given a mere written warning.

According to local residents, this law is routinely violated, Robinson said.\r\n\r\nAdditional local and state laws broken by the Officer&rsquo;s action:\r\n\r\nBloomfield ordinance &sect; 6-106&mdash;states that owners of cats and dogs found outside &ldquo;shall be notified in writing by the Police Department of their violation,&rdquo; meaning Larry should have been impounded and the owners notified that he was at large. Bloomfield ordinance &sect; 6-107&mdash;authorizes the killing by officers of dogs and cats whose &ldquo;capture is impossible.&rdquo; Because the Officer was able to trap Larry, clearly capture was not &ldquo;impossible,&rdquo; and the killing was not authorized. Nebraska State Law R.R.S. Neb. &sect; 28-1009, which states that &ldquo;a person who cruelly mistreats an animal is guilty of a Class I misdemeanor for the first offense and a Class IV felony for any subsequent offense;&rdquo; and defines cruel mistreatment as &ldquo;knowingly and intentionally kill[ing], maim[ing[, disfigure[ing],&rdquo; and otherwise harming an animal.','http://www.lifewithcats.tv/2014/03/07/call-for-action-after-police-officer-traps-and-kills-pet-cat/','Larry','Wally Holz','Yes','No',0,0,0,'No','No','Not Sure','NA','NA','No','No','Not \r\nSure','No'),(687,'2008-03-22','Pennsylvania','Cecil Township','Cecil Township Police Department',1,1,0,'Cat 10yo','as shot and killed by a police officer.It happened on Saturday after the cat wandered away from its Cecil Township home.

Lebanon City Manager Pat Clements issued a statement clearing the police department of any wrongdoing. Based on the information I have received, it appears that the officers actions were necessary and in compliance with departmental policies, Clement said. There are currently no local or county agencies equipped to respond to sick or injured stray cats, and our options are limited. Lebanon Police Department policy is to destroy sick or injured stray cats where they are found and under no circumstances is an officer to transport the animal in a city vehicle. The policy, however, appears to violate Ohio Revised Code. Cats are one of a number of animals protected by the code that says no one shall ?maliciously, or willfully and without consent of the owner? injure animals. The violation is a first-degree misdemeanor. Clements did not comment on the apparent violation, the Western Star reported.','http://www.officer.com/news/10342180/family-wants-policy-changed-after-ohio-police-kill-cat','Haze','Unknown','Yes','No',0,0,0,'No','Not Sure','Uniform','NA','NA','No','No','Not \r\nSure','No'),(689,'2012-06-23','South Dakota','Rapid City','Rapid City Police Department and Game Fish &amp; Parks',1,100,0,'Mountain Lion','A Rapid City family received an unwelcome guest on Saturday morning -- a mountain lion.\r\n\r\nRapid City police were called to the residence on Reservoir Road to find the lion hiding in a machine shed.

A Village of Stryker resident&rsquo;s complaint brought about an investigation and court case, and led to the issue becoming news. Ada Pierson, who has three cats of her own, took it upon herself to feed several strays she felt were in need help.  Ada told Channel 13 news, &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not being fed and they&rsquo;re not being taken care of,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I felt sorry for them.&rdquo; The cats disappeared in January  after a neighbor complained about cat feces and urine on their property, and Ms. Pierson claimed the local police trapped and killed them, then disposed of their bodies. &ldquo;They were either shot or they were drowned,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s horrible, they did not deserve what got. Why Stryker Police thought it was their duty to do something, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; A cat belonging to neighbor Carol Seehand was inadvertently caught up in the sweep and was shot and killed along with the feral cats.  Ms. Seehand filed a complaint against the police chief. Ms. Pierson contacted the Williams County Humane Society with allegations of animal cruelty, and a Humane Officer lodged a complaint. The Fulton County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department opened an investigation of police practices and the matter was turned over to the prosecutor&rsquo;s office in Bryan for review. Charges were brought against Stryker Police Chief Steve Schlosser. Prosecutors said Schlosser ordered officers to trap stray cats and shoot them.  Officers then dumped the dead animals&rsquo; bodies in the river. In a court appearance last month, Chief Schlosser pleaded no contest to animal cruelty saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m taking responsibility for my actions and my officers&rsquo; actions because that&rsquo;s what leaders do.&rdquo; The judge sentenced Schlosser to pay a $500 fine.   When asked for a comment on the sentence outside the courtroom, Ada Pierson &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he should keep his job.&rdquo; On the night of Monday June 10 the Stryker Village Council voted to suspend Schlosser for two weeks without pay. Public reaction continues to be mixed, with those who were outraged at the killings and dumpings feeling that justice was not served and punishment should have been greater, and those who felt the killing of &ldquo;just cats&rdquo; was no big deal saying greater punishment was not warranted.

Police were called to the scene in the 3900 block of Columbia Street about 9:30 a.m. by the homeowner who spotted the cat under plants in his back yard. The scene is about two blocks north of Euclid Avenue in a Highland Park neighborhood. Police said an officer shot the mountain lion near a greenhouse in the back yard of the home.  It was 6 feet 3 inches long, police said. &quot;The officers knew, due to the size of the mountain lion, that its escape would be of great danger to the public. The lion made a dashing move leaving officers no choice but to shoot the lion,&quot; said police spokesman Sgt. Christopher Scott in a news release. Police said that approximately two hours before the shooting that there were reports of a mountain lion around Madison Elementary School. The scene is close to two Des Moines schools: two blocks north of Harding Middle School and four blocks west of Madison Elementary School. The investigation into the incident is under way. Jeff Swearngin is a conservation officer from the Department of Natural Resources.  He said it appears the animal was just roaming the area. On July 12, a mountain lion was spotted in an area west of where the cat was shot Thursday.  A resident of a Norwoodville neighborhood, which is just southeast of the eastern mixmaster reported a mountain lion in the 3200 block of NE 46th Street on July 12. Children at the Norwoodville Rec Center were told to go inside as a precaution. Two police cars were sent to check out the report, but never found the cat during the July incident.

A monkey believed to be infected with Herpes-B was the last holdout, but police say it could have been eaten by one of the other escaped animals. &quot;We&#039;re convinced that we do not have any animals running at large,&quot; the Sheriff&#039;s office told NBC4. Sheriffs in Zanesville, Ohio, a  mostly rural area about 55 miles east of Columbus, have been working with zoo officials and wildlife expert Jack Hanna and agreed on a shoot-to-kill order, considering the immediate danger presented to the community. &quot;If you had 18 Bengal tigers running around this area, you folks wouldn&#039;t want to see what would happen,&quot; Hanna said at a press conference. The deceased animals include a wolf, six black bears, two grizzly bears, nine male lions, eight lionesses, a baboon, three mountain lions and 18 tigers, authorities said. They were buried at the location they were killed. Authorities were able to transport six animals to the Columbus Zoo, a grizzly bear, three leopards and two monkeys. The animals escaped from the Muskingum County Animal Farm in Zanesville after the owner threw their cages open and committed suicide, authorities said. Mike Dodd with the Muskingum County Sheriff&#039;s Office told FoxNews.com that authorities are urging the public to &quot;keep your eyes open.&quot; Schools were also closed, parents were warned to keep children and pets indoors and flashing signs along highways told motorists, &quot;Caution exotic animals&quot; and &quot;Stay in vehicle.&quot; Neighbor Danielle White, whose father&#039;s property abuts the Muskingum County Animal Farm, said she didn&#039;t see loose animals this time but did in 2006, when a lion escaped. &quot;It&#039;s always been a fear of mine knowing (the owner) had all those animals,&quot; she said. &quot;I have kids. I&#039;ve heard a male lion roar all night.&quot; The owner of the preserve, Terry Thompson, left the cages open and the fences unsecured, releasing dozens of animals, including lions, tigers, bears and wolves, before committing suicide, said Muskingum County Sheriff Matt Lutz. His body was discovered in the driveway. Authorities would not say how he killed himself and no suicide note was found. Lutz wouldn&#039;t speculate on why he committed suicide. But Thompson had had repeated run-ins with the law, and Lutz said the sheriff&#039;s office had received numerous complaints since 2004 about animals at the property. Authorities had difficulty entering the property because wild animals could be seen at its entrance, authorities said.

At approximately 3:12 p.m. Sunday, officers were dispatched to 905 N. Court, in reference to a domestic disturbance. When the officer arrived, he observed a pit bull that did not have on a collar. The officer asked the female, at the residence, if the dog belonged to her and she said it did. According to Ottumwa Police Chief Tom McAndrew, the situation escalated quickly almost immediately after the officer asked who owned the dog. &ldquo;The dog began to charge the officer and attempted to bite him. The officer drew his service weapon and discharged one round at the dog, striking it once in its front right leg near the elbow,&rdquo; said Chief McAndrew. The gunshot did not kill the dog and it was transported to a local veterinarian clinic.  &ldquo;The police officer transported the dog and the dog&rsquo;s owner to the vet, because the owner did not have a vehicle,&rdquo; said McAndrew. Sunday&rsquo;s incident was, reportedly, not the first time the Ottumwa Police encountered this pit bull. \r\n&ldquo;The dog had been ordered out of Ottumwa a few weeks ago, due to the city&rsquo;s ordinance against keeping pit bulls inside the city limits. The owner had advised that the dog had been removed from the city limits,&rdquo; said McAndrew. &ldquo;Our Community Service Officer Jeff Williams is actually in Arizona for training right now. When he returns, we will be able to determine the date that the pit bull was ordered out of the city and then we will determine if there will be any charges filed against the owner.&rdquo; The dog will remain at the veterinary clinic until Officer Williams returns from training. &ldquo;Once the dog was treated, the police department decided that the dog would be impounded at the veterinarian&rsquo;s office until we decide what we will do with the dog,&rdquo; said McAndrew. \r\nThe officer, who shot the dog, is not on administrative leave. However, the police department will take steps to determine that the officer took the correct action, in shooting the pit bull. &ldquo;We will look at the incident and determine whether he acted appropriately and go from there,&rdquo; said McAndrew. &ldquo;Looking at the reports, it looks like the officer did an outstanding job and did what he was supposed to. It looks to me that he was justified in shooting the dog and we are lucky that it didn&rsquo;t kill the dog, fortunately for the dog.&rdquo; Although the dog lived through the incident, it is unclear what his fate will be. &ldquo;What we have to decide now is whether we are going to let the owner have the dog or if we are going to put the dog down. We had reports from some of the neighbors, after the shooting, who stated that they had been chased by and attacked by the dog as well. It appears that the dog is vicious,&rdquo; said McAndrew. &ldquo;We gave the owner a chance to get the dog out of the city limits and she did not do that, so we will be conferring with our city attorney and decide what we are going to do with the dog.&rdquo; ','http://www.ottumwaeveningpost.com/9470/87459/a/ottumwa-police-officer-shoots-pit-bull','Unknown Pit Bull','Unknown','Yes','Yes',0,0,0,'Not Sure','Not Sure','Uniform','Yes','Not Sure','No','No','Not \r\nSure','No'),(711,'2012-03-09','California','Redding','Redding Police Department',2,10,1,'Chihuahua pregnant 2yo and Boxer Puppy 8 months old','Police killed a pregnant 2-year-old chihuahua and an 8 month old boxer.

The rat terrier and shih tzu mix isn&#039;t using her custom-made ramp to get to her fenced side yard, either.\r\nHer death, reportedly from a bullet fired by a Chaffee police officer Feb. 19, has prompted the Missouri Department of Agriculture to order a shutdown of Chaffee&#039;s animal impound and a separate investigation by the Scott County Sheriff&#039;s Department involving Chaffee police, the town&#039;s mayor and city workers. Police chief Jim Chambers was fired by the city council in a closed meeting, but members won&#039;t say why. According to a copy of the incident report about the dog&#039;s shooting obtained by the Southeast Missourian, it was the mayor who suggested that city employees shoot the dog and dispose of its body. A dispatch log shows that a dispatcher was later ordered to not tell the dog&#039;s owners about the fate of their pet. But it appears that no criminal charges will be filed in connection with the dog&#039;s death. According to a news release from Scott County Prosecuting Attorney Paul Boyd&#039;s office issued Thursday, the sheriff&#039;s department submitted probable-cause affidavits to Boyd on Feb. 28 requesting that Chaffee Mayor Steve Loucks be charged with animal abuse and making a false declaration. The sheriff&#039;s department also requested a false declaration charge for Chambers. Boyd turned the request over to Butler County prosecutor Kevin Barbour a short time later to avoid a conflict of interest, since he often works with the Chaffee Police Department. Boyd&#039;s office received a letter Thursday from Butler County that stated that upon review of evidence, a criminal conviction could not be supported and the Elfrink family would be &quot;better suited to seek civil damages.&quot; A copy of the Feb. 19 incident report and a dispatch log of the Chaffee Police Department from the same date was obtained Wednesday by the Southeast Missourian. Robert Ludwig, the officer who shot the dog, writes that on the day the dog was picked up by a city worker, the mayor and the police chief told him to take it out to the city compost site and shoot it, and that Chambers advised him to &quot;keep it quiet and not tell anyone.&quot; The report says the police department received a call around 1 p.m. from a Chaffee resident who said a dog had been outside the resident&#039;s apartment for most of the day and appeared to have mange. Ludwig responded to 537 W. Yoakum St. and then called the station to have a dispatcher request the city&#039;s animal control officer, Jerry Laxton. Ludwig also thought the dog had mange. The dispatcher could not reach Laxton, so Ludwig drove to Rhodes 101 store in Chaffee, where Laxton works part time. As they talked about the dog, Loucks entered the store and was told about the dog and that the officers weren&#039;t sure what to do with it. It was then, Ludwig wrote, that he suggested taking to the dog to a veterinarian, but Loucks said no and to take the dog out to the city compost site and shoot it. Ludwig and Mark Lueder, a city employee who picked up the dog, met at the compost site around 3 p.m. Ludwig wrote that he went to the site because Lueder left a message at the police station that he did not have a gun. When Ludwig arrived, Lueder had already dug a hole. &quot;I then loaded a range round into my service weapon and then Mark placed the dog into the hole. At that time I took aim and shot the dog once in the head,&quot; Ludwig wrote. According to the report, Lueder covered the hole, and the two men left. Dispatcher logs show Jennifer Elfrink called the police station at 4:30 p.m. and reported her 14-year-old dog, which was blind and deaf with back legs that did not work properly and looked like it had mange, was missing. She told the dispatcher the dog did not have mange but suffered from another virus and was on medication. The log says Ludwig was advised of the call. At 6:15 p.m., logs show, Elfrink called back and said she was worried someone would find the dog and think it was sick or abused. The dispatcher wrote he advised Elfrink that he was not aware of a dog being located. Close to midnight, Elfrink called back a third time and said she was driving around looking for the dog with her children in the car and that she was worried. The dispatcher checked the log, saw a dog was found and disposed of, and called Chambers. At midnight, Chambers is listed on the log as telling the dispatcher not to tell Elfrink anything. Chambers could not be reached at his home number Thursday. Acting police chief Dustin Jarrell was not at the police station Thursday and would not return to work until this morning, according to a communications employee at the department. Loucks was reached by phone Thursday at Chaffee City Hall before the Boyd&#039;s release was sent to media. Loucks said he could not comment because the incident was under investigation and that he was advised not to. He also wouldn&#039;t comment on who was advising him. The Southeast Missourian requested the city&#039;s ordinances relating to dogs during the call and received the documents at city hall Thursday afternoon. State law requires all incorporated cities or towns to collect dogs found running at large without collars and place them in a pound. The city shall keep dogs for five business days and allows euthanasia using humane methods if the animal is not claimed by its owner by the end of that period. Section 270.150 of Chaffee city ordinances state an animal not redeemed within seven days becomes city property and shall be placed for adoption or humanely euthanized. The city&#039;s pound was found to be unlicensed under the Animal Care Facilities Act during a March 6 investigation by the Department of Agriculture. In a March 5 email to Loucks, Animal Care program manager Matt Rold wrote that a complaint filed by a Chaffee resident prompted the investigation. Loucks said Thursday that the city&#039;s pound could not receive animals but that police could still deal with animals if one caused harm or threatened to cause harm, per instruction of the Agriculture Department. The investigation found numerous issues, including that the impound did not meet requirements for cleaning, food storage, waste disposal, shelter, construction of facilities, identification of impounded animals, record keeping, handling of animals or minimum holding period. The inspection report also says the city must go through the application process and meet all requirements by April 6. &quot;We won&#039;t be back open until some changes are made,&quot; Loucks said. Scott County Sheriff Rick Walter said the probable-cause affidavit requesting charges for Loucks and Chambers could not be released unless a prosecutor filed charges. Walter said he was aware that Jennifer Elfrink had contacted the Agriculture Department to file a complaint and that she shared with him an initial recommendation from the department. The department advised her that normally she could contact law enforcement, but that in this case, Walter said Elfrink was told, &quot;the local police are probably not going to help you.&quot; Elfrink&#039;s husband Wayne was contacted Thursday afternoon at their home. He said what happened to their dog was &quot;a sad situation.&quot; Several city council members reached by the Southeast Missourian declined to comment.

But before the officer got to the door, he shot and killed the family pet. At the quiet country home east of Goshen, you can seldom hear anything but the wind blowing through the trees. But that peace and quiet was shattered by the bullet from the gun of an Elkhart County sheriff&#039;s deputy. The aftermath was caught on a cellphone video. You can hear a friend of the dog owner asking why the dog was shot and the police officer replying that the dog had attacked him. The officer then asks if he should leave and the homeowner tells him yes. &quot;It&#039;s a family member and to just see something like that is something you&#039;re just not going to forget,&quot; said the owner of the dog, Josh Bender, &quot;My dog&#039;s name was Charlie. He was a red heeler lab mix dog. He was a pretty cool little guy. He loved to play fetch. He was always playing fetch, always.&quot; Bender watched as Charlie died from a gunshot. Only minutes earlier he was sitting down to eat lunch when he heard his two dogs barking in his driveway. His wife told him a police officer was pulling up. But before Josh could walk outside, Charlie had been shot. &quot;I was just getting ready to come out the door and I heard a pop,&quot; Bender said, &quot;I looked out the door and saw my dog flailing around here with blood everywhere and a police officer standing there with a look on his face like &#039;what did I do?&#039;&quot; The Benders live about a quarter mile off of CR 36 and the officer, Mike Daly, had to drive the entire way down their driveway to their house. According to the Elkhart County Sheriff&#039;s Department, Daly had first observed the dogs to be friendly, but shortly after they became aggressive. As he tried to back up to his car, he claims one of the dogs charged &ndash; that&#039;s when he shot it.

Just a really sad situation, it could have been totally avoided if he would have just thought about it.&quot; According to the Elkhart County Sheriff&#039;s Department, Daly is a veteran officer. The sheriff&#039;s department says they have a protocol for this type of thing. The department says it is investigating the incident and is taking it very seriously. It has been nearly a week since an Elkhart County sheriff&#039;s deputy shot and killed someone&#039;s dog. After an investigation, the department is sticking by the officer&#039;s actions. On Saturday the officer went to a home in the 16400 block of CR 36 to investigate a traffic incident that had occurred earlier in the day.

Chris Clark, 44, said he was walking his Rottweiler, Quincy, and his landlord&#039;s Chesapeake Bay retriever, Missy, about 10 p.m. He was in the 4600 block of Sixth Avenue North when he noticed a golden retriever being walked behind him without a leash. He said he decided to speed up to put some distance between his leashed dogs and the retriever. That&#039;s when he noticed Officer Slobodan Juric walking toward him. Juric was in the area responding to a complaint about a suspicious person, according to police reports. Clark said Juric was yelling, trying to find two kids who were allegedly casing cars. &quot;He was real Joe Macho,&quot; Clark said of Juric. Then Clark heard Missy and the unleashed dog growling at each other. By the time he turned to look, Quincy&#039;s leash had wrapped around him. He fell and the dogs started fighting. Clark said he was grabbing his dogs&#039; collars, trying to pull them away, when Juric yelled &quot;mad dog&quot; and pointed the gun at Missy. Clark said the gun was 3 inches from his ear when Juric fired one shot into the dog. Then the officer pointed the gun at Quincy and fired another round, Clark said. Then two more into Missy. Clark said he was in shock and started yelling at the officer, who still had his gun out. &quot;What the hell did you do that for?&quot; Clark said he yelled. &quot;You curse at me one more time and I&#039;m going to arrest you,&quot; Clark remembers Juric saying. The St. Petersburg Police Department declined to comment on the specifics of Clark&#039;s allegations, said spokesman Mike Puetz. &quot;We&#039;ve begun an internal affairs investigation,&quot; he said. &quot;There will be a statement taken from (Clark) and from everybody who was a witness in the case, to try and discern the totality of the events and the appropriateness of the (officer&#039;s) action.&quot; Juric, 25, has been with the department for more than a year.

Some worried they would get big enough to hop the small fence that bordered the yard. But no one foresaw what happened Saturday. About 3 p.m., one of the dogs apparently managed to escape and attacked a person walking in front of a house next door, according to St. Petersburg police. A neighbor helped escort the person to safety and officers soon arrived. They tried to coax the dog back into the yard, but it charged, police said. An officer fired a shot from his service pistol and wounded the dog. The dog was taken to a local animal hospital with a non-life-threatening injury, and its owner was notified, police said. It was unclear how badly the person who was attacked was hurt. The police did not release identities of the bite victim, the officer involved or the dog&#039;s owner.

Elizabeth Feichter and her family adopted Ciarra and her sister, Molly, from Georgia Lab Rescue when they were 10 weeks old. According to Feichter, Ciarra was a sweet and docile 65-pounder &ldquo;who&rsquo;s never even come close to harming anyone.&rdquo; Atlanta police spokeswoman Sgt. Lisa Keyes said the shooting is under investigation, adding, &ldquo;We emphathize with the homeowner&rsquo;s loss.&rdquo; Keyes said she could provide no furher information. Feichter, her husband, and their two sons were visiting family in North Carolina when the shooting happened in the backyard of their Howard Street home. Feichter, 33, who runs a philanthropic consulting firm, said she can&rsquo;t believe the officer had no choice but to shoot Ciarra. &ldquo;He could have said &lsquo;Stop!&rsquo;, he could have said &lsquo;Wait!&rsquo;, he could have pulled out Mace, he could have just stepped behind our garden fence, he could have fired into the ground,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Ciarra would have taken off and sat shivering in a corner. She&rsquo;s very timid.&rdquo; It was about 9 a.m. Saturday when the family got a call from the alarm company saying the alarm was going off. They couldn&rsquo;t immediately reach their house sitter, who had gone out for breakfast, so they called 911. Soon they reached the sitter, Hilary Stewart, who returned to find the front and back doors locked. Apparently, it was a false alarm. &ldquo;The officer pulled up at that moment, so I said, &lsquo;Let me talk to him,&rsquo;&rdquo; Feichter said. &ldquo;We spent a few moments joking because he was the officer who had come out when our cars got broken into six months ago. He said, &lsquo;No big deal, I don&rsquo;t mind coming out.&rsquo; &ldquo;Then he said he was just going to take a look around and make sure everything was safe.&rdquo;\r\nHe gave the phone back to Stewart. Feichter heard her say the dogs had gotten out into the backyard. &ldquo;Then she said, &lsquo;Oh my God! He just shot her,&rsquo;&rdquo; Feichter recalled.\r\nNeighbors rushed over. Ashley Derrick and Alison Grounds picked up Ciarra and drove her to the vet, but it was too late. In an email to members of the East Lake Neighbors Community Association, Derrick wrote that she arrived to find the officer beside the dog. &ldquo;I asked why he had to shoot her,&rdquo; she wrote. &ldquo;He could give me no answer.&rdquo;\r\nStewart could not immediately be reached; she left Sunday on a scheduled mission trip. And Feichter did not recall the officer&rsquo;s name. Feichter said her two sons, 12 and 8, are traumatized.

She walks back over to Peeples and does it again. She&rsquo;s got sparkly purple polish on her nails. Two days earlier, Peeples&rsquo; dog Egypt, also an American Staffordshire Terrier, was shot by San Diego police officers who say the dog came at them in a threatening manner. Egypt was hit three times&mdash;in the paw, lower leg and shoulder&mdash;and less than an hour later, she was euthanized by San Diego County Animal Control officers, who say Peeples gave them permission to put Egypt down. Peeples said he did no such thing. &ldquo;I told them over and over, &lsquo;Do not euthanize my dog,&rsquo;&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty sure she knows&rdquo; about Egypt&rsquo;s death, Meyer said, commenting on Mali&rsquo;s behavior toward Peeples.\r\nUsually lumped in with Pit Bull Terriers, American Staffordshire Terriers, or AmStaffs, have a reputation not as fighters but as loyal family pets. Peeples said he never had any problems with Egypt, except a complaint from a neighbor that she barked too loud. Egypt loved to play with Peeples&rsquo; 7-year-old son and 6-year-old nephew and would sit at the edge of Peeples&rsquo; front yard, waiting for neighbors to come over to give her treats. Like her dog pal Mali, she often had polish on her nails&mdash;Meyer&rsquo;s mom&rsquo;s idea&mdash;and a matching collar. She didn&rsquo;t so much like the manicures, but after they were over, &ldquo;she&rsquo;d run around with a little pep in her step,&rdquo; Peeples said. &ldquo;She was the delightful nuisance of the neighborhood,&rdquo; said Chris Victor, who lives across the street from Peeples. &ldquo;She&rsquo;d see you and she&rsquo;d wag from head to toe.&rdquo; But for all their friendliness, AmStaffs are inclined to protect their owners and property, which could be the reason Egypt went running toward the cops. Around noon on Tuesday, Dec. 2, Peeples was watching TV at home when he heard a knock at the front door. When he looked out the door&rsquo;s top window, he saw a group of men standing on his porch wearing jeans and T-shirts, a couple of them looking a little ratty. To get a better look, he went to a side window and peeked through the drawn blinds. &ldquo;Honestly, they looked like they were transients,&rdquo; he said. The men, it ends up, were undercover narcotics officers who were there on a complaint about drug activity at that address&mdash;Peeples was later told that it had to do with a &ldquo;chemical smell.&rdquo; Peeples said the men&mdash;he estimates there were six&mdash;never announced who they were. He decided not to open the door and watched as two broke off from the group and walked up the driveway that runs alongside the one-story bungalow he shares with his mom. The men opened a gate leading to the backyard and walked up to the back door. They started knocking and yelling &ldquo;Hello?&rdquo; through the locked security door, Peeples recalled. Peeples was standing in the doorway of a front bedroom where he could see the men but they couldn&rsquo;t see him. &ldquo;It looked like they were trying to case my house,&rdquo; Peeples said. Egypt ran to the security door and started to bark at the strangers. Eventually the two men left the back door and returned to the front of the house. Peeples opened the back door to take a look around; when he did, Egypt ran out. Normally, she&rsquo;d stop at the backyard gate, he said, but the men had left the gate&rsquo;s door open. With nothing to stop her, Egypt went running down the driveway and Peeples went after her. He heard gunshots and saw two men with guns drawn. Wounded, Egypt ran to the backyard. The men pulled out their badges, told Peeples they were undercover narcotics agents, handcuffed him and told him he was being charged with assault with a deadly weapon. A police cruiser pulled up, and Peeples was stuffed in the back. &ldquo;Charge him with everything you can charge him with,&rdquo; he remembers one of the officers saying. San Diego Police Department spokesperson Monica Mu&ntilde;oz confirmed that Egypt didn&rsquo;t attack the officers, but she said they were within policy to shoot her. &ldquo;The animal was charging the officers,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They weren&rsquo;t going to wait to see if [she] was actually going to bite them.&rdquo; Mu&ntilde;oz disputed Peeples&rsquo; claim that there were six officers, saying that narcotics officers work in teams of four. As to their attire&mdash;Peeples said he would have opened the door immediately and kept Egypt at bay if he saw a uniformed officer at his door&mdash;Mu&ntilde;oz said that&rsquo;s not the way narcotics officers operate. &ldquo;Narcotics teams work undercover, work in plainclothes,&rdquo; she said. She referred to what they were doing as a &ldquo;knock-and-talk&rdquo; and confirmed that officers didn&rsquo;t have a search warrant. &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t do any surveillance&hellip;. They went out to check out the complaint.&rdquo; Mike Marrinan, a San Diego attorney who specializes in police use-of-force cases, questioned the officers&rsquo; decisions, starting with having two undercover cops enter an enclosed backyard. &ldquo;People have an expectation of privacy in their backyard that they might not have in their front,&rdquo; Marrinan said. And, obviously, leaving the gate open was a mistake, Marrinan noted. Peeples told CityBeat that if the officers had closed the gate, Egypt would never have run out. Even more troubling, Marrinan said, is the fact that officers were so quick to draw their weapons in a residential area. Meyer, Peeples&rsquo; neighbor, said he heard five shots. According to a police dispatch log, a 911 call reported four or five shots. &ldquo;Bullets can ricochet,&rdquo; Marrinan said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got one relatively small dog, and we&rsquo;re shooting our guns five times?&rdquo; Handcuffed and in the back of the police cruiser, Peeples watched as an animal-control officer led Egypt, covered in blood, out from the backyard. From the trail of blood she left behind, Peeples later determined that Egypt had run up to the back door and then took refuge under some shrubs. Peeple&rsquo;s was approached by an animal-control officer who asked for permission to put Egypt to sleep, telling him it was the humane thing to do. Animal Control spokesperson Dan DeSousa said Peeples&rsquo; verbal authorization to euthanize Egypt was witnessed by a second officer, but Peeples insists he never gave permission. &ldquo;Do not kill my dog; do everything you can to save my dog,&rdquo; he remembers yelling. When he saw Chris Victor, his neighbor, he asked him to make sure Egypt was kept alive. Victor said he called animal control to let them know he&rsquo;d cover any cost for Egypt&rsquo;s care, but by the time his call got through, Egypt had been euthanized. DeSousa said the dog was put down immediately after arriving. Though the assault charge against Peeples was dropped, Mu&ntilde;oz said police have filed misdemeanor charges against him with the San Diego City Attorney&rsquo;s office, including not having a dog license, endangering the public&rsquo;s safety and possession of marijuana. A search of Peeples&rsquo; garage, OK&rsquo;d by his mom, turned up a scale and a tiny amount of marijuana so old that it disintegrated upon contact. Peeples went to pick up Egypt from animal control last Thursday. Victor and Meyer went with him. She was handed over in a clear plastic bag. &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t know she was a sweetheart,&rdquo; Victor said. &ldquo;Had they said &lsquo;sit,&rsquo; she would have sat.&rdquo;','http://www.sdcitybeat.com/sandiego/article-6073-do-everything-you-can-to-save-my-dog.html','Egypt','Unknown Undercover Police (six)','Yes','No',0,0,0,'Yes','Yes','Plain Clothes','No','Not Sure','No','No','Not \r\nSure','No'),(733,'2009-01-27','Florida','Saint Petersburg','Pinellas County Sheriff&#039;s Department',1,50,1,'Chow and Pit Bull mix 9yo','A Pinellas County sheriff&#039;s deputy knocked on Lee Ann Hutts&#039; door Tuesday night and her dog, Smoke, started barking incessantly. Within moments, the deputy pulled out a gun and shot Smoke in the head. That&#039;s about all Hutts and the deputy agree on. The deputy says Smoke attacked him, and he shot in self-defense. Hutts said Smoke was barking, but never attacked the deputy. An eyewitness backs Hutts&#039; account. Smoke died the next day. The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals is investigating. &quot;We have a call in to (the deputy&#039;s) supervisor,&quot; said Connie Brooks, a local SPCA investigator. &quot;You know, sometimes they see things a little differently.&quot; Hutts, 32, and her neighbor Tina Morrow said deputies came to their mobile home park on 28th Street N investigating a burglary report. Unable to find the right home, a deputy went to Hutts&#039; door. Hutts, who takes care of a disabled sister-in-law and lives with her fiance and roommate in her mobile home, said her 9-year-old chow-pit bull mix was barking when she opened the door but stopped when she told him to be quiet. She tried to put him in another room but he followed her out. Smoke kept barking but never left her side, she said. The deputy was agitated, she said, and kicked her dog. Then he shot him. &quot;I damn near passed out,&quot; Hutts said. &quot;I had blood all over me, I was screaming.&quot; The deputy left, she said. Pinellas sheriff&#039;s spokeswoman Marianne Pasha offered a different account based on an incident report from Sgt. Robert McGuire and a supplemental report from a backup deputy. McGuire, a 24-year veteran, wrote that when he knocked on Hutts&#039; door he could hear a dog barking. When Hutts answered, he asked her to secure the dog. The dog appeared to charge him, so he shooed the dog with his foot. &quot;He believed the dog was going to bite him,&quot; Pasha said, so he shot him in the head. The deputy was unaware that Smoke died. Pasha asked a reporter how the dog was doing and was told he had died. Hutts said she and her sister-in-law took the wounded Smoke to Noah&#039;s Place 24-Hour Animal Medical Center on 62nd Avenue N. Unable to afford the $3,000 she was told surgery would cost, Hutts left with a prescription for pain medication. She took the dog home and stayed up all night with him. Smoke died in the morning. Cathy Miktuk, the property manager at the mobile home park, Suncove Apartments, said the entire neighborhood is upset. Everyone loved Smoke, who barks a lot but was never aggressive, she said. &quot;We&#039;ve all got dogs, and a lot of us watched what happened,&quot; Miktuk said. &quot;Why didn&#039;t they just mace that dog?&quot; Miktuk called the SPCA Tuesday morning and helped gather statements from witnesses.

Around 5 a.m. Friday, Coco was shot and killed in his backyard by a Las Vegas police officer.\r\nThe officer was one of several who were searching for a DUI suspect who fled on foot from a traffic stop near Nellis Boulevard and Sahara Avenue, according to department spokesman Bill Cassell. Police searched a nearby neighborhood with a helicopter equipped with a heat detecting device and spotted a large mass in a shed behind a home at 4880 Welter Ave., Cassell said. Cassell said the dog, which was inside the shed, confronted officers. But he said he didn&#039;t know how the dog displayed aggressiveness. &quot;The officer did everything he could to avoid shooting at the dog. Ultimately he was forced to fire in self-defense,&quot; Cassell said. Two shots rang out.

Sandra Orozco, 27, said she was awakened by seven police officers in her backyard around 4:30 a.m. The officers then jumped the wall between the two yards, she said.\r\nOrozco couldn&#039;t see the shooting while standing in her patio because the wall blocked her view, but she and her parents did hear two pops that she later learned were the fatal shots. She said Coco was &quot;always gentle&quot; and played well with her 5-year-old daughter. De La Torre, teary-eyed and surrounded by photos of the dog, said that was one of the reasons she adopted Coco. She remembers first seeing him at the Lied Animal Shelter three years ago. While other dogs barked and jumped for attention, Coco didn&#039;t make a sound. &quot;Coco just put his head right next to the door, looking for attention,&quot; she said. Coco let De La Torre&#039;s four Chihuahuas jump on him and bite his tail. When one of them became too rough, he gently nudged them with his paw. With her 6-month-old daughter, Coco would set his face in her lap and she would pull on his ears. Coco didn&#039;t mind, De La Torre said. He was just happy for the attention. De La Torre and Fernandez don&#039;t believe Coco could have harmed the officer and are upset that the officers didn&#039;t ask before entering their backyard. They also don&#039;t believe catching the suspect was worth jumping into their backyard and killing their dog. &quot;I don&#039;t think it&#039;s right,&quot; De La Torre said. &quot;It wasn&#039;t like he was a killer.&quot; Las Vegas police do not have official procedures for dealing with dogs because each encounter is different, Cassell said. Officers are just instructed to balance the risk to themselves and the public in such incidents. They&#039;ve been involved in other similar shootings. In 2005, while chasing a graffiti vandal, two Las Vegas police officers shot and killed one pit bull and wounded another that they encountered in the dog owner&#039;s fenced yard. Police said the animals chased the officers. In 2004, while responding to a burglary call, an officer jumped into a backyard and shot and killed a blue heeler-dingo mix that police said &quot;charged aggressively&quot; at the officer. In both of those cases the department either paid veterinary bills or offered to pay cremation costs. They haven&#039;t done either in Friday&#039;s incident, according to Fernandez and De La Torre. While clutching Coco&#039;s blood-stained collar, Fernandez showed a receipt of $225.45 they had to pay to a nearby veterinarian to have him cremated after police took the dog to the clinic. &quot;He wasn&#039;t a dog. He was family,&quot; Fernandez said.','http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/familys-pet-coco-killed-police','Coco','Seven Unknown Police','Yes','No',1,0,0,'No','No','Uniform','No','Not Sure','No','No','Not \r\nSure','No'),(735,'2014-05-12','Florida','Orlando','Orlando Police Department',1,2,1,'Unconfirmed','The following is based entirely on police statements: Officials said an Orlando police officer was forced to shoot a dog after he was bitten on Monday.

Tyree, 37, said she heard two pit bull dogs bark at her in the predawn darkness. She said she turned and saw the dogs standing in the middle of the street in the 3300 block of S.E. Colfax. In short order, Tyree said, the dogs charged at her. A short time later, a Topeka police officer fired two rounds, both of which struck and killed one of the &ldquo;vicious&rdquo; pitbulls. But before that happened, Tyree had to take quick action to keep herself and her baby safe. As the pair of dogs began to charge at her, Tyree said, &ldquo;I told them to go home. I guess that made them mad.&rdquo; Holding her 5-month-old son, Christian, in her left arm, away from the dogs, Tyree jumped on the hood of her car, parked in a driveway on the east side of S.E. Colfax. She used her feet to kick at the dogs as they tried to jump on top of her car, she said. Just then, a neighbor across the street saw what was happening and yelled out &ldquo;Go home&rdquo; at the dogs, who then turned and headed north on S.E. Colfax toward the man&rsquo;s house. Tyree said a police car arrived on the scene about the same time. She said the officer got out of his patrol car and was charged by the dogs. The officer, Tyree said, swung his baton back and forth three times, backing up in the process, before using his gun to shoot one of the dogs two times. The dog died at the scene. The other dog, meanwhile, took off running and police hadn&rsquo;t located it by 9 a.m. &ldquo;The officer didn&rsquo;t want to shoot the dog,&rdquo; Tyree said. &ldquo;It was his last resort.&rdquo; Cpl. Louis Cortez said at the scene that police had been notified of the pair of pit bull dogs running at large in the neighborhood, charging at people and preventing children from going to their school bus stop. At least two additional residents on the block were forced to seek safety on top of their cars when they were charged by the dogs, Cortez said. While police don&rsquo;t want to be forced to shoot dogs, Cortez said, cases such as Monday&rsquo;s incident leave officers no choice but to do so. He said the incident was the result of the dogs&rsquo; owners not taking responsibility and keeping the animals secured.\r\nCortez held four pieces of paper that had witness reports of the incident, all agreeing on the facts of the situation and stating the officer took &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; action. Animal control officials picked up the deceased dog, who died near the west curb in the 3300 block of S.E. Colfax.

Of interest is the fact that police and media claim the dog was a &quot;120 pound pit bull&quot; despite the fact that male pit bulls weigh between 35 and 66 pounds. Flint police try to avoid lethal force with dogs whenever possible, but after a Taser didn&#039;t stop a 120 pound pit bull from attacking a 14-year-old boy in late June, they say they were left with no choice. Flint City Councilman Bryant Nolden said the incident happened on Sunday, June 22, while more than 1,000 people were at the Berston Field House for a weekly softball game. The Third Ward councilman said he is the volunteer director at Berston, so he unlocks the facility for the community to use from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. during the games on Sundays. Nolden said during the softball game, he saw a teenage girl walking the pit bull around the baseball diamond area. Nolden said the girl was having trouble controlling the large, leashed dog and he told her she should not have the animal in such a large crowd of people. &quot;She could not handle the dog. It was obvious, because the dog was pulling her all over the place, and a few folks, including myself, said, &#039;You really shouldn&#039;t have this dog down here. Especially with this many folks down here.&#039;&quot; Nolden said. Flint police and Michigan State Police were already at Berston to aid in traffic control after the softball game. Nolden said he requested a police presence after a number of teenagers began coming to the facility and fights broke out. &quot;We&#039;ve had problems with teenagers using social media to settle neighborhood beefs and we had a couple of incidents where we had girls down there fighting,&quot; Nolden said. &quot;That&#039;s why we were requesting the police presence, because of the sheer numbers and the amount of young folks from 13 to maybe 18 that are coming down. And they aren&#039;t coming down for the games, they are down here to start problems.&quot; According to a Flint police report, officers were conducting crowd control for the spectators when the dog broke loose from its leash and charged a 14-year-old boy. Officers first attempted to use a Taser on the dog during the attack, but the animal was unaffected. The dog then turned and charged toward the officer, who shot two bullets at the dog. According to the report, the dog continued, charging at a second officer who fired another two rounds, paralyzing the animal. Flint Police Chief James Tolbert said officers had to use deadly force on the animal after the Taser failed to work on the dog, because it posed a threat to the crowd after attacking the 14-year-old boy. Tolbert said the officers did not want to shoot the dog again because of the large crowd. Genesee County Animal Control came to the scene and took possession of the injured dog with the owner&#039;s consent. Chief Animal Control Officer Stephani Lazar said the center euthanized the dog. Lazar said some breeds of dog are just too much for some people to handle if they don&#039;t take the time to train them and keep them in safe and healthy situations.\r\n&quot;It&#039;s unfortunate. A lot of people buy these large-breed dogs with dominant personalities and they don&#039;t get them neutered and they don&#039;t train them properly and then they get put into situations where they can&#039;t handle these animals and then a person or another animal gets hurt,&quot; Lazar said. &quot;So these animals are set up to fail, and in the meantime not only do they fail, but they hurt somebody else.&quot; Lazar said some dog owners expect all breeds to have the same personality, but said that is not the case. She said the best thing a dog owner can do is to research their breed, get them spayed or neutered, and into an obedience class. Nolden said he is an avid animal lover, but believes the officers did what they had to in order to protect the crowd. &quot;I&#039;m a dog lover and I&#039;m on the Genesee County Animal Control Sub-Committee and I&#039;m really passionate about animals and their rights, but this dog was just really, really big and I do not fault the police officer for protecting the community,&quot; Nolden said. &quot;I could not have held that dog, it was that big.&quot;\r\nThe 14-year-old boy who was attacked suffered minor injuries and was taken to Hurley Medical Center for treatment, police said.

Police said the dog barked, lunged at the first officer and bit his handgun after the officer responded to a complaint in the 1900 block of West Bergan Street just after 5 p.m. Thursday. The attack reportedly came after police tried for several minutes to keep the pit bull at bay with a yard rake and lure it back to its owner&#039;s house with some food. &quot;It was just time to keep somebody from getting hurt,&quot; Capt. Phil Trent said.\r\nTrent said an officer first went to 1901 W. Bergan to help a 13-year-old boy and a 16-year-old boy who said the dog had them trapped in a car. As the officer approached, the dog ran behind a neighboring house. A few moments later, while the officer was asking a neighbor about the dog, it ran toward the officer and lunged at him. Because the neighbor said the dog might live at 1911 W. Bergan, the officer lured it to the backyard with some food. But as soon as the food was gone, the dog again lunged toward the officer. The officer drew his handgun and pointed it at the dog, which backed away for a moment but then jumped at the officer and clamped its teeth onto his gun, Trent said. After the officer pulled his gun away from the pit bull, the dog appeared to gather itself for another jump, and another officer who had arrived drew his .40-caliber handgun and fatally shot the dog.\r\nSouth Bend Animal Care and Control officers soon arrived and took the dog away.

Note that the police shot the dog at the scene of a fire that destroyed the dog owner&#039;s home. The dog was in the owner&#039;s car while the fire burned. The dog jumped through the car window to allegly attack the police. The police used the opportunity to perform a warrantless search of the car where they discovered a small amount of marijuana, leading to a criminal charge for the owner. Two West Manheim Township Police officers, including the chief, were bitten by a dog while at the scene of a house fire in the township Monday morning. Chief Tim Hippensteel, who suffered injuries in the attack, was forced to shoot the pit bull, police said. It is expected to survive. Fellow police officer Sgt. Toby Wildasin was also injured when the dog belonging to a tenant of the burned home leapt from a car and attacked them. Both officers were treated at the scene for their injuries. The dog&#039;s owner, Christopher Adam Weibe, 20, of 31 Rickey Drive, is in York County Prison on $2,500 bail, stemming from the attack and drug charges, police say. Hippensteel was sent to the home about 11:20 a.m. for the fire and, once there, went into the burning house to search for anyone inside but was forced out by heavy smoke and flames, police said. Weibe and another person were asleep in the basement but heard Hippensteel&#039;s shouts about the fire and, with the pit bull, got out via a basement door.\r\nPolice say Weibe became argumentative and uncooperative when officers told him he had to secure the dog. Weibe put the dog in his car, which is missing a passenger-door window, police said. The dog jumped through the window and attacked Wildasin, biting his inner thigh and groin area, causing minor injuries, police said. Weibe regained control of the dog and put it back in the car. But it didn&#039;t stay there for long. It again jumped through the window, this time attacking Hippensteel and biting his right calf, police said. Hippensteel shot the dog once with his handgun. It was at that point that, police say, Weibe also got out of the car and shoved Hippensteel to the ground. Weibe ran away but was arrested a short time later when he returned to the scene. The dog was found nearby and was taken to a veterinarian for treatment, police said. Charges: Officers found marijuana, which Weibe took from the home when he fled the flames, in Weibe&#039;s car, police allege. They also found drug paraphernalia inside the home, police said. Weibe was taken to the county&#039;s central booking unit, where he was arraigned. He is charged with aggravated assault on a police officer, simple assault, resisting arrest, reckless endangerment, harassment, possession of marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia, police said. It&#039;s not known if he has retained an attorney. Police have asked the York County District Attorney&#039;s detective bureau to investigate the shooting to see if department regulations and state law were followed. The fire: Pleasant Hill Volunteer Community Fire Co. Chief Ted Clousher said the blaze started in an attached garage and spread to the house. Crews had the fire under control in 25 to 30 minutes, the chief said. Weibe and the other resident weren&#039;t initally aware if anyone else was inside the home. That caused firefighters to search the house twice. No one else was found inside, Clousher said. All told, five adults and three children were displaced, according to the local Red Cross, who is assisting them with food, clothing and a place to stay. A state police fire marshal is investigating its cause, Clousher said, adding it caused $125,000 in damage. The house is owned by a member of the armed forces who is serving aboard. He is renting the house and the residents do not have renters&#039; insurance, Clousher said.

Beard is accused of obstructing official business, and Brown faces two counts of felonious assault on a law enforcement officer and one count of resisting arrest.

She says that police were originally called to the house because a neighbor may have heard the couple arguing. While police were questioning Sanita, his girlfriend says that Diesel, who was inside the house with her, began getting agitated realizing his owner may be in trouble. At one point, she opened the front door to go back outside to see what was going on, and the dog forced its way past her and attacked the officer. She told NBC 10 that the dog has never before exhibited this type of violent behavior, but thinks he acted this way to protect his owner. Lieutenant Connor said that the officer did what he was trained to do in this type of situation, &quot;in this case, it was a large pitbull and the officer had been bitten at least once at that point and upon protecting himself he did what he needed to do.&quot; Sanita will remain held until Monday, while the dog is being held at Warwick Animal Hospital pending a vicious dog hearing.

It all started at about four in the morning in July, 2009. Tallahassee Police Officers Joseph Azevedo and Mark Adrick arrived at a home in the 1400 block of Charlotte Avenue. The officers were there because Kyle Marshall&#039;s live in girlfriend for two years claimed he was going to harm her black lab Dutch and wouldn&#039;t return it. Marshall says it&#039;s not true and fallout from a fight. The officers claim Marshall ordered his dog Smitty to attack them.\r\nOfficer Azevedo fatally shot Smitty. &quot;The officers maintain that the dog attacked them and they were justified in using the force they used,&quot; said Cassandra Jackson, a spokeswoman for the Tallahassee City Attorney.\r\n&quot;In no way was Smitty aggressive,&quot; said Marshall. &quot;In no way did he look aggressive,&quot; he said. &quot;This was basically the officers not manning up to a mistake they made and covering themselves to keep their jobs,&quot; Marshall said.\r\nWhile Marshall admits he was rude to the officers and told them to leave his property multiple times, he says he feared for his own life after Officer Azevedo shot Smitty. He says he tried to close the door and get away, but the officers entered his home and Acevedo shot Marshall twice with a taser. &quot;They shot my dog right on my front porch and then came into my house,&quot; said Marshall. &quot;What rights do you have if you can&#039;t stay in your own house,&quot; he said. &quot;It was determined their actions were completely justified because they were in fear for their own safety,&quot; said Jackson. Marshall was arrested and charged with two counts of aggravated assault on a law enforcement officer, resisting an officer without violence and petit theft of the dog. He faced up to 30 years in prison. However, the state attorney dropped all the charges, noting &quot;the dog in this case does not meet the definition of a deadly weapon&quot;.\r\nMarshall then sued. Instead of going to trial, the city settled out of court with Marshall for $25,000. &quot;There was some concern perhaps the sympathy factor because of the dog,&quot; said Jackson explaining the decision to settle.\r\nWhile Marshall has received the $25,000 settlement, he says his legal bills were more than $40,000. And he said he sat in jail for two weeks. He says he was offered a plea deal for three years in prison he&#039;s glad he didn&#039;t take. &quot;It&#039;s real serious,&quot; said Marshall. &quot;It would&#039;ve changed my entire life,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#039;d still be in jail right now,&quot; Marshall said. Instead Marshall left Tallahassee to get a fresh start in California. As for Officers Azevedo and Adrick, a Tallahassee Police Department internal affairs investigation cleared them both of any wrongdoing.','http://www.wctv.tv/home/headlines/Man-Settles-Suit-with-Tallahassee-Police-Over-Dog-Shooting-201666411.html','Smitty','Joseph Azevedo and Mark Adrick','Yes','No',0,0,0,'Yes','Yes','Uniform','Not Sure','Not Sure','No','No','Yes','No'),(768,'2014-07-22','Florida','Miami','Miami-Dade Police Department',1,2,0,'Unconfirmed','A Miami officer with the department&#039;s mounted patrol shot and killed a dog that was lunging for the cop&#039;s police horse, authorities said.

However, the Phenix City Police Department says the dog made an aggressive move at the officer. Assistant Police Chief Robert Casteel says his officer was helping U.S. Marshals look for an escapee from Georgia. He says an informant told them the suspect would be at the Dillingham Street house. When they got there, Casteel says there were some people sitting in the back, including Westfall. U.S. Marshals approached them while he says his officer went to check on a shed that music was coming from. Casteel says U.S. Marshals asked Westfall to restrain his dog. \r\n&quot;Mr. Westfall was asked to take control of his dog and declined, and when the officer walked around from behind the car the dog made an aggressive movement toward him, baring his teeth and the officer fired one shot,&quot; says Casteel. Westfall tells a different story. He says his dog barked at the marshals and officer when they first arrived, but then calmed down once Westfall told the dog to be quiet. He tells News 3 the officer went into his shed to look around, and when he came out the dog barked twice. Westfall says the officer then pulled out his gun and shot the dog in the head from about 10-15 feet away.\r\n&quot;At first I thought it was a taser gun or something and then I looked at my dog and my dog&#039;s brains were hanging out. My dog&#039;s sitting there, he&#039;s panting- he lasted about 10 minutes before he died,&quot; says Westfall. &quot;Mr. Westfall may have been under that impression that the dog would be fine,&quot; said Casteel. &quot;But police officers get different reactions from dogs from other people because dogs can sense an apprehension whenever they arrive on the scene, and some dogs that won&rsquo;t bite anybody else will bite a police officer or people in uniform because they sense that apprehension.&quot; Westfall said his dog, a boxer, did not attack the officer and has never been an aggressive dog. &ldquo;My dog lives here, this is my dog&#039;s house. Somebody comes on my property; yeah my dog&#039;s going to bark at you. He has never bit anybody, and I don&#039;t think he would unless you hit him or kick him,&quot; says Westfall.

The following is the statement of the owner of the victim, who was handcuffed and forced to kneel in the desert while the police killed her dog: \r\n\r\n&quot;On July 4th I was driving alone with my service dog of almost 8 years of age, Dunkin&rsquo;, in the rear seat towards the middle. I was pulled over on I-17 after being tailed for about one mile. The cop was very close to the rental car I was driving which was a gray Toyota corolla. The vehicle was due back on Sunday and I had planned on returning it, then utilizing the airport shuttle to catch my early flight back to New York&rsquo;s La Guardia airport with Dunkin as my travel companion. I pulled over to a safe spot on the shoulder of the road and the cop opened the door and drew out a shot gun. He actually AIMED it at me. I could see his eye aiming and it made no sense. I was shouted at and told to keep my hands where he can see them. This seemed very strange and not at all common for being pulled over. I could hear shot gun cocked and I realized that something was not right. I obeyed his shouts to keep my hands up and I allowed Dunkin to continue sleeping in order to keep us both calm. I was ordered to get out of the car, walk backwards without looking, and was very confused&hellip; I was going further and further away from Dunkin&rsquo;. I was shouted at to kneel, yelled at and then immediately cuffed and put in the back seat of a cop car. I immediately told him that my service animal is in the back of the car and to please be careful with him as he is license in NY state and is official for my Multiple Sclerosis. The car was overwhelmingly hot and my MS symptoms began as I tried breathing for fresh air. It was getting hotter and now he was drawing a weapon to the vehicle. I was very frightened that they would kill Dunkin&rsquo; as they looked like they would do so with the weapons drawn so intently. The cop opened the rental car door which was nearest the I-17 traffic. Dunkin&rsquo; rested soundly on that side of the vehicle. When the door was opened, the cop let him get out of the car onto oncoming traffic. Dunkin&rsquo; got out of the vehicle confused. He ran into oncoming traffic, looking for me. His mission is to look for me, wherever I may be. As cars swerved and missed him&hellip; I screamed. I prayed and screamed at the top of my lungs for my companion&rsquo;s safety. The cop S.D Soto (who was the one who aimed at me through his shotgun, also cuffed me) walked to the front of the car passenger area. He pulled out Dunkin&rsquo;s fluorescent orange service vest and read the insert in his pocket which states that he is a service animal and he is protected under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. S.D Soto Read the facts, read my rental agreement (which was located on the passenger seat area) and continued to ignore my pleas for help and air conditioning. At this point a red headed cop was on the scene too, along with a thicker sized blonde-red headed cop. I will never forget their faces. One wore shades, the other had glasses and piercing blue eyes. They completely ignored my existence and did not check on me. Someone chased Dunkin&rsquo; and I told them that he would ONLY come to me. I begged and pleaded to allow them to let me call for him. S.D Soto told me to shut up and I was annoying him. He said that he would gag me next, if I said another word and did not cooperate. I noticed my wrists were really in a lot of pain and my body temperature was rising in the back of the car. Dunkin was nowhere to be seen, he ran off into the area where desert grows. At this point, I hoped coyotes would not get him. I was screaming for them to listen to my pleas and my proof that it was a rental and I do indeed have MS and need my service animal for my well-being. Again, I was shouted at while they walked around calmly with no care for Dunkin or my safety. My safety was compromised the moment they ignored me and Dunkin&rsquo;. They never read me any rights, and continued to walk around, ignoring how hot I was in that car. It felt like a fish out of water and I was gasping for air. Dunkin&rsquo; came back through the desert area to about 10 yards north of the vehicle which obtained me. I screamed again, and begged them to keep him safe. They again chased him, frightened him, and he ran northbound. I never saw my Dunkin&rsquo; again.\r\nAt this point the sergeant&hellip; Robert Hardt, was called to the scene. I was let out of the vehicle, still cuffed very tightly. I am 5 feet tall and weigh 110 lb&rsquo;s. I whistled in vain to call Dunkin&rsquo;.. I was not allowed to walk towards the area he has run towards. I was not allowed to move. I was on the gravel on the side of the road waiting for the cops to do something. I begged the sergeant to lead me, with the cuffs, or however he seemed fit, in order for me to be able to get to Dunkin&rsquo; to whistle for him. He told me not to worry and &ldquo;the dog will come back.&rdquo; A cop car came back with Dunkin&rsquo;s destroyed body in it. I asked an officer&hellip; is there anything left&hellip; the red headed one with the glasses and blue eyes shook his nod, indicating that there was nothing left to see. At that point, I began to mourn. I screamed and I screamed in shock. My hands were still cuffed. I was thirsty, the srgt gave me water from a water bottle he had in his car. Around that point, I was uncuffed. I called my friends and family in NY and AZ and no one answered for what seemed an eternity. I finally reached a friend in NYC and I screamed in agony at the trauma I had just undergone. The srgt called ambulance to see about my MS. They said to me, &ldquo;you cannot scream and cry in my ambulance.&rdquo; I refused treatment since I could not help my emotions of having lost my dearest best friend in this earth. They wanted to sedate me and start and IV on me. I refused this as I did not think I would wake up if I allowed them to stick a needle in me. Already they had violated me. A sheriff&rsquo;s chaplain was then called to the scene. My phone died, and I was able to speak to my brother, who was in Hawaii vacationing, through the srgt&rsquo;s cell phone. My brother was extremely concerned about my MS as he understands the close bond that Dunkin and I have shared for almost 8 years. I was in no condition to drive, I do not know who drove the rental back to the rental location. My belongings were put in a bag, I was put in a car with the chaplain and I continued to document my bruising by photographing my wrists with the time on the dash board. I grieved the entire way to the hospital asking the chaplain for words of consolation and he was speechless. The bruising on my legs from kneeling on the tar/gravel started to emerge when I got back to NYC. I have attached those pictures in a previous email. I was never cited for anything, I was never read any rights, I was not arrested. I ended up in the hospital and was given a sedative. I had x-rays taken of my wrists as the pain was excruciating to the slightest touch. My friend Andrea Barker took Dunkin&rsquo;s remains to the animal crematory where Dunkin&rsquo; was cremated. His remains arrive in New York in a few days.\r\nI have already felt the symptoms of MS which has been in full remission for 4 years. My left hand buzzes and tingles, my capacity to concentrate has diminished and my job is in jeopardy. I am a Master&rsquo;s degree student at NYU and begin a new class tomorrow. I have received 2 A&rsquo;s and 3 B&rsquo;s in the coursework I have achieved and I hold a position of Learning Specialist at the College of Dentistry. I am my sole provider and feel the stresses of this trauma impeding my rest, my work, my concentration, my spirit (which feels broken). I experience nightmares nightly and sever bouts of mourning.

Brittany Chambers was startled early this morning when officers showed up at her side gate after finding her broken down car a few blocks away.\r\nPolice say they wanted to make sure the car hadn&#039;t been stolen. &quot;I Heard the gate kinda jiggle I heard her bark, and then I didn&#039;t hear her bark anymore, just the little one,&quot; said Chambers. The officer opened the side gate to the backyard and encountered the Chamber&#039;s two dogs. &quot;Yeah they barked too, yeah and he still proceeded to come in and he shot the dog,&quot; said Kevin Chambers. &quot;She was just doing what she&#039;s there to do which is there to let us know someone was at the gate and to protect the gate, he opened the gate,&quot; said Brittany. According to police, the officer fired his gun three times toward their dog Winter when they say she became aggressive toward him and began by biting at his legs. &quot;From the time that they knocked on our door to the time they shot the gun couldn&#039;t have been more than 30 seconds,&quot; said neighbor Effie Craven. Craven described what happened next. &quot;I don&#039;t know why they didn&#039;t knock on the gate, or yell over the fence, or come back to our door and ask us to call  them, the first thing that happened was the dog got shot,&quot; said Craven. While police say it wasn&#039;t clear if the dog was hit neighbors followed what looked like a trail of blood down the street. But despite searching there is still no sign of Winter who the family says was their son Tyler&#039;s best friend. &quot;They loved each other, camping and everything all those experiences. He&#039;ll remember them, they&#039;re great memories So yeah I&#039;m glad I could provide her with a decent life,&quot; said Kevin.

But the family who owns the dog, named &quot;Jack,&quot; disputed the claims made by police. A police report obtained Friday morning revealed new details about the incident. The dog reportedly acted aggressively toward two teenagers, a man and a plain-clothes detective that was driving by before being flagged down. Two teenage girls and a man living in the area told police a black dog had ran aggressively toward each of them around 5:30 p.m., first the girls, then the man, the report states. The girls, who were jogging, had seen a white dog first. They approached what seemed to be a lost and friendly dog, the report states. That&#039;s when, according to the police report, the black dog &quot;came out of nowhere&quot; at them, barking. The girls avoided the dog by climbing on a small rock wall, then the dog turned its attention to the man who was walking to get his mail. The dog was &quot;aggressively barking&quot; at the man, the report states, so he threw keys at the dog to scare it. That man then noticed plain-clothes LCPD detective Rick Garcia pulling into the neighborhood and asked him to call animal control. Garcia, after calling for animal control, said he tried to shoo the black dog away, then corral it into a nearby yard. Neither tactic worked, the report states, so Garcia said he tried to back away. When he did, &quot;the dog lunged at him for a third time,&quot; barking and with teeth bared. That&#039;s when Garcia said he fired two shots, hitting the dog near the head and back. Kelcy Wilcox, whose family owned the approximately 4-year-old dog, adamantly denied that Jack, the mostly black Catahoula mix was aggressive. She said the dog would have reacted the way it did because it was frightened. &quot;He&#039;s not an aggressive dog,&quot; said Wilcox, a New Mexico State University graduate who earned a degree in animal science, and has directly worked with the dog for about 2 1/2 years. &quot;He was extremely well mannered, well trained.&quot; According to a letter Wilcox wrote to the Sun-News, the family took the dog out publicly, to the Las Cruces dog park, Caliche&#039;s, St. Clair&#039;s Winery for Yappy Hour, Andele&#039;s Dog House and High Desert Brewing Co. By the time the animal control officer arrived, the report states, a roommate of the dog&#039;s owner arrived. They tried to look for the white dog, which had fled. The animal control officer reportedly found it in its yard, around the block from where the black dog died. As he approached that yard, a neighbor warned him to beware of the black dog living there because it &quot;was a crazy dog,&quot; according to the report. &quot;All he did was growl,&quot; Wilcox said. &quot;That is a warning and not a reason to shoot him.&quot; The adult man and two teenage girls who the police said were being harassed by the dog were not injured. As per departmental policy related to the duty-related discharge of a firearm, the multi-agency task force will investigate the shooting. The task force includes investigators from New Mexico State Police, the Do&ntilde;a Ana County Sheriff&#039;s Office, New Mexico State University Police and Las Cruces police. The task force reports its findings to the 3rd Judicial District Attorney&#039;s Office. Garcia, a 16-year-veteran of LCPD, is not subject to standard administrative leave, as happens in shootings involving people, LCPD Sgt. Roberto Gutierrez said this week.

The dog&#039;s owners told KFOX14 that the police shouldn&#039;t have done that. Dan Trujillo, a spokesman for the Las Cruces Police Department said just before 11 a.m. Monday officers responded to a report of a vicious dog in the 1000 block of Larry Drive. When they arrived they discovered that the dog had bitten or attacked a 79-year-old man who resides near the owners of the canine, said police spokesman Dan Trujillo. According to Trujillo the dog approached the police officer &quot;aggressively.&quot; The dog allegedly pinned the officer against his unit. The officer is believed to have fired at least one round which struck the dog. However, the owners, Marin Serna and his fiancee Sonia Gonzalez said their dog Mac was too small to pin an officer. They said their dog was wrongfully shot and the victim of breed discrimination. Gonzalez said the officer should not have had to use his gun to restrain a 30 pound dog. An Animal Control officer took the dog to a local veterinarian where the dog was pronounced dead. Injuries to the 79-year-old man who was bit or attacked by the dog were non-life-threatening. Investigators are also looking into the possibility that the dog may have attacked someone else earlier in the day. Trujillo said, &quot;Right now the Las Cruces Police Department and our Officer involved Incident Task Force, which is made up of agencies throughout the area, are jointly investigating this shooting.&quot; He said they investigate any officer-related shooting that occurs on duty. The dog did have a history of getting out of the yard but not for being aggressive.  Officials said the owner has been cited two times in the past 12 months for the dog getting out.

News that the department is considering tranquilizer guns, however, brought little consolation to the dead dog&#039;s owner, Harold Mason. Mason is a retired Delaware County 911 dispatch supervisor and currently serves on the Muncie Board of Works, appointed there by Mayor Sharon McShurley. Mason believes that even without tranquilizers, the officers had alternatives to deadly force, including tear gas and Tasers. He criticized the officers for using their guns to break up a dog fight and questioned whether his dog was the victim of breed discrimination. &quot;The only reason they shot my dog is because he is a pit bull,&quot; Mason said. &quot;If you run up on a Chihuahua and poodle and the Chihuahua has got the poodle around the neck, are you going to shoot the Chihuahua? It was a dog fight. Dogs fight.&quot;\r\nHAROLD! you&#039;re a fucktard! if your pit fighter was fighting another pit fighter your idiotic comment would have some credibility. but this situation is the equivalent to an adult beating up a child. Barrett, however, defended the shooting, saying the officers did the best they could in the situation. Barrett was not on the scene but has reviewed corresponding reports. &quot;Based on what I know right now, I would say they did what they should do,&quot; Barrett said. &quot;You have to take all the possibilities into account.&quot; Mason&#039;s dog, a six-year-old brown pit-bull named Bishop, was killed about 11:30 p.m. on July 30. Earlier that evening, Bishop had gotten loose from Mason&#039;s back yard along North Gavin Street, where he kept the dog on a cable, and apparently sauntered over to a neighbor&#039;s house on nearby Lowell Street. &quot;This dog is not a vicious dog,&quot; said Mason, who sort of inherited Bishop from his son. The neighbor had befriended Bishop, Mason said, and her porch had become the pit bull&#039;s home away from home. On this night, however, the neighbor had tied a German shepherd to her front porch, having found it wandering the neighborhood earlier, Mason said. A fight between the dogs ensued and, according to police reports, Bishop sunk his teeth into the German shepherd&#039;s neck. Muncie police officers Kristopher Duncan, Chris Kirby and Shane Finnegan responded to the fight after the neighbor called 911. Kirby said he considered rubbing hand sanitizer into Bishop&#039;s mouth to get it to release, but that the dog was angry and wouldn&#039;t let the officers get close. To save the German shepherd, the officer said, he had to shoot the pit bull. &quot;I&#039;m a dog lover. I hate what happened,&quot; Kirby said. &quot;I hate it. It just breaks my heart. If I had another alternative, I would have used it.&quot; Kirby&#039;s first shot struck Bishop in the side, but according to police reports the dog continued to fight. Kirby and Finnegan fired several more shots before Bishop left the scene, apparently mortally wounded. Kirby tracked him down to a neighboring back yard where he euthanized the dog with a shot to the head. While police reports available to the media did not indicate exactly how many shots were fired, Mason said he heard eight as he ran to the scene of the fight. &quot;That&#039;s what concerns me is to shoot at a dog eight times in a residential area,&quot; Mason said. Mason showed The Star Press a nearby home that had at least four holes in its vinyl siding that appeared to be from gunfire. The neighbors told The Star Press that at least three of the holes were not there before the police shot at the dog. Barrett said police believe one of the holes came from the officers, though the department is not sure whether the bullet ricocheted or struck the house directly. &quot;They weren&#039;t just recklessly firing rounds into the air,&quot; Barrett said. Kirby, who estimated seven shots were fired, said as far as he knew none struck the house. &quot;We were close enough on every shot that every shot went into the dog,&quot; he said. After the chaos died down, animal control came and took away both dogs. Kirby -- who is currently providing foster care for an abandoned pit bull until a rescue group can find her a home -- reported that the German shepherd had lost a lot of blood but appeared as if it would recover. The flip side of this story is that they may have saved the German shepherd&#039;s life,&quot; Barrett said. Mason wasn&#039;t so sure. &quot;All they had to do was wait for me,&quot; he said. &quot;I could have got my dog.&quot; Mason met with Police Chief Deb Davis in the days after the shooting. (Davis referred questions to Barrett). &quot;I&#039;m not trying to get anybody in trouble,&quot; he said. &quot;I just don&#039;t want this to happen to anyone else.&quot; Barrett told The Star Press that the department&#039;s decision to pursue tranquilizer guns was not influenced by Mason&#039;s status in Muncie. &quot;It&#039;s not just about Harold or who it is,&quot; Barrett said. &quot;This is a scenario that we are coming onto more recently.&quot; The department has been looking at a tranquilizer gun that cost $227 and is considering buying three of them. It is unclear if and when the department might actually buy the guns and make them available to officers. The tranquilizer guns would likely stay in the cars belonging to uniform shift supervisors. If available, the supervisor would be dispatched directly to all animal fight or vicious animal calls. &quot;That&#039;s something we would put into our protocol,&quot; Barrett said.\r\nBarrett said he believed officers would welcome the tranquilizer guns so that they wouldn&#039;t have to resort to their firearms. He said officers are emotionally affected any time they have to take a life, even a dog&#039;s life.','http://www.thestarpress.com/article/20100807/NEWS01/8070329/Officers-kill-pit-bull-MPD-to-consider-dart-guns','Bishop','Chris Kirby, Kristopher Duncan and Shane Finnegan','Yes','No',0,0,0,'No','Not Sure','Uniform','NA','No','No','No','Not Sure','No'),(788,'2014-02-26','New Mexico','Las Cruces','Border Patrol and Las Cruces Police Department',1,2,0,'Mixed','A Border Patrol agent has been jailed after a late night incident Wednesday in which police allege he threatened his family with a gun, shoved his wife then fatally shot the family dog. Carmelo Diaz Jr., 44, has been charged with three felonies &mdash; two counts of aggravated assault against a family member and extreme animal cruelty &mdash; plus misdemeanor battery against a household member, according to a Las Cruces Police Department news release. Diaz, of the 2500 block of Kentwood Court, is being held at the Do&ntilde;a Ana County Detention Center. His wife told police that Diaz became upset when she declined to kiss him, grabbing her by the neck and pinning her to a kitchen wall, according to a criminal complaint filed in Magistrate Court. Diaz then ran upstairs and &quot;threatened to take his own life,&quot; the complaint states. His wife followed, eventually finding him in the bathroom, but not before he allegedly pushed her to the ground. Diaz was armed with a .40-caliber handgun, according to the news release. Frightened, Diaz&#039;s wife fled to his teenage son&#039;s room. Diaz allegedly followed her, then pointed the gun at her face. Later, he allegedly pointed the gun at his teenage son, the complaint states, while saying, &quot;I don&#039;t give a (expletive). I&#039;ll kill everybody.&quot; Eventually Diaz&#039;s wife and two children ran to a neighbor&#039;s house.

Diaz reportedly told his son to &quot;tell dispatch everything&#039;s OK,&quot; the complaint states. Diaz then walked away, and that&#039;s when police allege he shot the family&#039;s mixed-breed dog. A veterinarian determined the dog was paralyzed, according to the LCPD news release, and it was euthanized. Police responded to the family&#039;s home about 8:30 p.m. Wednesday after a call about a domestic disturbance. Diaz reportedly drove away in his silver Toyota Camry before LCPD officers arrived.\r\nLater, officers located Diaz&#039;s car parked on White Sage Arc. Police found a shell casing near Diaz&#039;s car &mdash; he apparently shot his cell phone, breaking it and a car window. Officers later blocked many of the streets in the Sonoma Ranch and Northrise area while conducting a search for Diaz, according to scanner traffic Wednesday. A nearby gym was locked down during portions of the search. An officer at the family&#039;s home saw Diaz hiding in the shadows, according to scanner traffic. Officers ordered him to drop the handgun which he did before being taken into custody. A Border Patrol spokesman confirmed Thursday that Diaz is an agent with the federal agency.\r\nDuring his video arraignment Thursday in Magistrate Court, Diaz said he had been working for Border Patrol for nearly four years. The Border Patrol&#039;s communications department released a statement on the matter to the Sun-News: &quot;The Border Patrol takes every allegation of misconduct seriously.

This week it was reported that sergeant Barry Antwine was charged with &ldquo;laying out poison for domestic animals&rdquo;, after his neighbors filed a complaint. Prosecutors say Antwine  put  a substance -- possibly anti-freeze -- in a bowl in front of his house in early April.\r\nThe investigation began when a complaint was filed by a neighbor claiming  Antwine had poisoned several dogs. Officers say at least six dogs died. A vet we spoke to said he treated two dogs that died after ingesting anti-freeze. On April 7, Antwine was put on paid administrative leave pending the investigation. Chief Ken Grace says he will remain on leave until the case is resolved. This is not the first time Antwine has been arrested either. In 2013, when he was a school resource officer, it came to light that he was arrested under the charges of second degree rape and molestation while he attended Wagoner High School in 1997. An affidavit shows that a 14-year-old girl accused Antwine of touching her inappropriately while they were in class, to which Antwine admitted doing so. Antwine then entered into an agreement of deferred prosecution with the State of Oklahoma that stated charges would not be filed if he met the conditions of the agreement for four years.

What went unexplained was where the tame buck may have originated. Powhatan Point resident Heidi Brown offered a likely explanation for the animal, often referred to as Bucky. &quot;I believe that this deer once belonged to my late father-in-law, Marvin Brown. After the fawn&#039;s mother had been hit by a car, Marvin rescued and raised the young deer,&quot; Brown wrote in a letter. She said the deer was amazing to see, behaving like a dog by playing with children, greeting visitors, following Marvin Brown around and even enjoying car rides. &quot;On November 18, 2013, Marvin was shot and killed,&quot; Brown went on to say. &quot;A few days after Marvin&#039;s murder, his deer ran away. The deer was wearing an orange collar for his own protection during hunting season. But, given his friendly nature, we did not expect the young deer to survive for very long, especially without Marvin to care for him.&quot; When Bucky wandered into Clarington several months ago, he was wearing an orange collar. The small village is just seven miles from Brown&#039;s home in Powhatan Point, and the age of the buck in question seems to fit the timeline. Brown stated that she was relieved to read about residents caring for Bucky, calling it &quot;heart-warming.&quot; &quot;Although it was devastating to learn that the little guy was put down, I am grateful to the people in Clarington who cared so much for him during his short life.&quot; Meanwhile, outrage over ODNR&#039;s decision to kill Bucky has continued to grow. Online news outlets have reported on the issue, while animal rights activists and others have jumped in to criticize ODNR on its Facebook page. There was even a yousign.com petition to fire the officer who shot Bucky in the public park near the edge of Clarington. As of Wednesday afternoon, it had received 3, 052 signatures, but on Thursday afternoon the petition had been deleted. Much of the outrage centers around the fact that the deer was killed in front of two young girls who had fed and pet him. Bucky is also connected to a petition on change.org labeled &quot;Support Trooper&#039;s Law &amp; Make Compassion Legal! Protect Animal Wildlife &amp; Stop the Killing!&quot; The petition calls for the state to allow willing and licensed rehabilitation experts, veterinarians and caretakers to provide appropriate care for injured wildlife, such as deer or raccoons. &quot;The hands of our veterinarians have been tied by the government. They are not permitted to treat certain wildlife such as an injured fawn...and, they [ODNR] threaten compassionate caretakers with arrest, jail time and fines,&quot; the petition says. Clarington resident Sandy Potts, whose yard was frequently visited by Bucky, had this to say about the petition. &quot;Although we lost our Bucky to the cruelty of the ODNR, his death has brought a national spotlight to our cause. The people at saving Trooper were working with us to help save Bucky and we need to support them so this law is passed and never happens again,&quot; she wrote on her Facebook page. The controversy reached the Ohio Humane Society, whose director, Corey Roscoe, sent a letter to Scott Zody, Chief of the Ohio Division of Wildlife. Roscoe expressed disappointment with ODNR&#039;s decision, and said that many Ohio residents have placed distressed calls to his agency. &quot;This did not appear to be a case of illegal possession, but rather of a habituated deer who was not sick or exhibiting threatening or dangerous behavior. We...agree that it would have been best for him as well as the public that this conditioning be broken, but a non-lethal approach should have been tried before the rather arbitrary decision to kill the animal was made,&quot; Roscoe wrote. He went on to say he would welcome a meeting with ODNR staff to discuss protocol and resources for situations like these in the future.','http://www.timesleaderonline.com/page/content.detail/id/561380/New-light-shed-on-deer-s-origins.html?nav=5010','Bucky','Unknown','Yes','No',2,0,0,'NA','NA','Uniform','NA','NA','No','No','No','No'),(799,'2014-09-09','Nevada','Las Vegas','Las Vegas Police Department',1,2,0,'Unconfirmed','Las Vegas police shot and killed a dog Tuesday afternoon after receiving calls that it was attacking someone.

I live with my wife Ginger and our two small children in Mason County, West Virginia. On June 24, 2014 the WV State Police Special Response Team shot and killed our dog. The WVSP were searching for a man named Jonathan Jeffers, who they allege shot at an officer while he responded to a domestic violence call. Mr. Jeffers fled from the police and ended up in the woods near our house. We live in a very rural, and secluded area near Milton, WV. My wife Ginger was at home with our two small children, RaeLee and Avery. The morning of the 24th she noticed a local sheriffs vehicle in our driveway. She let me know, and I made the decision to call the sheriffs office as this was way out of the ordinary. They noted that I called, but didn&#039;t provide any information as to why they were on our property. Over the next two hours, the police presence increased, including a helicopter flying overhead. I called the sheriffs office again to make sure they knew that my wife and children were home. At that time they explained that they were actively searching for a fugitive, and they would alert the officers that my family was inside our home.\r\nAt approximately 1pm my wife put our oldest daughter down for her daily nap in the nursery. When she came out she noticed 6-8 men dressed as soldiers come out of the woods and into the gravel road in front of our home with a K9. Our dog Willy Pete, a six year old beagle/basset mix was asleep on his pillow right outside our front door, and directly beneath the window that Ginger was watching from. The K9 unit was \r\nbarking when Ginger watched Willy Pete get up and leave the porch toward the officers. Ginger watched as one of the men raised his rifle towards Pete. She immediately ran outside to the top of the steps of our porch and began screaming for them to not shoot our dog as he would not hurt them. A shot was fired and Ginger saw a plume of dust come up from our yard between our dog and the officers. My dog being very afraid of guns (we live in an area with a lot of hunters) immediately turned around to run for Ginger, who was still desperately yelling for them to stop when they fired 3 more times. Willy Pete ran behind our house while Ginger ran through it to the back door. She saw Pete on the ground gasping for air and watched him die next to our air conditioning unit. Moments later an officer came into our house. Ginger was literally in the floor sobbing begging to know why they had killed our dog. He responded &quot;Ma&#039;am we couldn&#039;t let our dogs fight. We are dog people too. Where is your shovel so we can bury him.&quot; Ginger told them I was on the way home and she wasn&#039;t going to do anything until I got there. I arrived approximately 15-20 minutes later to a veritable sea of police officers and vehicles. My wife was on our porch screaming and so upset I couldn&#039;t even understand what she was saying. I was screaming at them asking why they had killed my dog when I heard Ginger say they \r\nhad shot towards her and the house (our younger daughter was in her chair in the living room by the window). I asked them why they would shoot at our house when the person I found out later to be the one who killed our dog grabbed my arm and cursed at me saying id better calm down before I got myself into trouble. Almost immediately they were asking me where my shovel was, and that they would do us the service of burying the dog. I told them I would help dig the hole, but I couldn&#039;t bear to look at my boy like that. Ginger and I gave statements to one of the officers and I began digging my dogs grave. The officers finished the hole and buried my dog. Before they left one of them came in and made an attempt at apologizing for what they had done. Ginger confronted him by asking why they shot towards her and our house. His demeanor instantly changed, and he left immediately. Several days later the WV State Police \r\noffered us a voucher from the Humane Society for a dog from a local shelter. We respectfully declined. Being on a very limited income, saying that we couldn&#039;t afford an attorney to represent us would be an understatement. We decided to use the only tool that we felt we had available and made efforts to get our story on local news media and the internet. Almost immediately we received an outpouring of support. \r\nThe WV State Police were obviously unprepared to handle the backlash and decided to make statements through their Facebook Page. These comments included the statement that reports of the dog being shot as it was running away were &quot;completely fictitious&quot;, and insinuated that we were inciting violence towards the police. All we did was ask for an investigation into the shooting. Based on these statements we decided to do the unthinkable and dig our dog up to have a necropsy performed. Several days later the WV State Police issued a lengthy press release as can been seen here . This press release is almost entirely false as it pertains to the killing of our dog. They claim that Sgt. S.T. Harper shot Willy Pete three times within 3-5 \r\nfeet as Pete continued to advance. However, we are in possession of a necropsy report which clearly shows our dog only has one entry wound and no exit. This means that by their own admission they must account for the other two bullets that are not in our dog. The WV state police are absolutely responsible for where we stand today. Ginger and I are left with the heartbreaking loss of our loyal dog that we watched born into this world. Ginger will live the rest of her life with the horrific image of him running desperately to her for help. We have had our sense of security taken from us, and even worse my families lives were endangered when that officer made the terrible decision to shoot at my dog. Thankfully our children and my wife were spared. The damage they inflicted on us is not something that will soon be repaired. We will one day have to teach our children about what they do when they are in trouble, and we want to tell them like our parents told us, you pick up the phone and call 9-1-1. \r\nUnfortunately, I won&rsquo;t be able to teach them that without the specter of these events flashing through my mind. Ginger and I have always been respectful of law enforcement, and refuse to give any credence to anyone who threatens violence against anyone brave enough to do their job. Ginger and I want our girls to be proud of the message that we leave behind. That message is that you stand up for what is right, even when it is against seemingly insurmountable odds. We have retained the counsel of Richard B. Rosenthal, General Counsel for The Lexus Project and Maxwell Hiltner of Mills, Mills, Fiely &amp; Lucas. We intend to pursue federal action against the WV state police seeking an injunction to require officers be trained on how to handle encounters with domesticated animals as well as establish a requirement for Independent oversight of future incidents. Nothing can give us our sense of security or our precious family member back, but we can take solace in knowing that we did what was necessary to prevent this kind of horrific event from disrupting another family&rsquo;s life. God forbid the next time something like this happens the consequences could be infinitely worse. Since this happened to us last month we have become aware of just how often this happens in our country. The WV state police have only kept records for 4 years on dog shootings. Based on those records they have killed 15 dogs including Willy Pete. Sgt. S.T. Harper is responsible for three of them. This is one police agency in WV in 4 years. We shudder to think of the numbers once police agencies all across the country are considered. Our Facebook page receives information on a new incident almost every day.

Randy Green sued the Village of South Holland, police Officer Chad Barden and other unknown officers, in Federal Court. South Holland, pop. 21,000, is a southern suburb of Chicago. &quot;On Sunday, July 22, 2012, two South Holland Police Officers arrived in separate vehicles at the home of Randy Green between 9-10 am, to investigate a purported dog off-leash (at large),&quot; the complaint states. &quot;Upon information and belief, a caller had identified the dog at large as &#039;a big old gray dog runnin&#039; around.&#039; The caller made no mention of the dog being dangerous, vicious, or aggressive. &quot;The two South Holland officers arrived while plaintiff Randy Green and his family were asleep inside of their home, and where Mr. Green&#039;s Cane Corso dog, Grady, was sitting on the front porch. &quot;Upon information and belief, the chain holding Grady in the Green family backyard had popped, allowing Grady to be off leash on and around Mr. Green&#039;s residence. &quot;Both South Holland officers were equipped with dog-catching poles in the trunks of their vehicles, but neither attempted to use the dog-catching poles to capture the purported dog at large. &quot;South Holland officer Chad Barden stood, with his gun drawn, near the Green family home while the dog Grady sat on the front porch. &quot;The accompanying South Holland officer stood, leaning against his own police vehicle, approximately 100 feet away from Officer Chad Barden. &quot;The dog Grady walked past both officers on more than one occasion without incident, thereafter lazily returning to the front porch of the Green residence. &quot;At no time did the dog Grady make physical contact with either officer. &quot;The South Holland police officers stood outside the Green family home for approximately twenty minutes. &quot;At this time, the dog Grady approached Officer Barden again as he was standing nearest the Green family home.\r\n&quot;Shortly thereafter, Officer Barden shot the dog Grady three times for no reason.&quot;\r\nGrady, wounded, ran into the back yard and Green &quot;rushed outside&quot; to help him and take him to a vet. Citing an &quot;Expert Report,&quot; Green claims that &quot;video surveillance footage from the Green family residence revealed the absence of any charging, lunging or showing of teeth by the dog Grady and instead showed the dog Grady seeking &#039;greater distance between the officer and himself,&#039; displaying &#039;calming [body] signals&#039; by &#039;looking away from the officers and showing his [Grady&#039;s] flank,&#039; and moving in a &#039;trot.&#039;&quot; The family immediately &quot;took Grady to an emergency veterinary facility where Grady was treated,&quot; the complaint states. Meanwhile, &quot;South Holland police officers walked onto the residential property of Randy Green, including his backyard and other private areas near his home,&quot; Green claims. A month later, South Holland police delivered a letter accusing Green of having a dangerous dog.

Dan Marocchi said his 2-year-old German shepherd, named Max, never attacked the officer and didn&#039;t deserve to die. &quot;The Ogden Police Department is trying to cover up a bad shooting,&quot; he said Monday. However, Ogden Police Lt. Chad Ledford said the dog lunged at two officers before being killed. &quot;This could have been avoided if he (Marocchi) controlled his dogs like he was asked to do,&quot; Ledford said. The incident began about 5:30 p.m. Sunday when police responded to a report of a man with a gun at Marocchi&#039;s residence in the 2400 block of Jackson Avenue. Marocchi, 67, believes he was reported to police because he answered his door carrying a handgun for protection because a long-haired man, whom he didn&#039;t know, was standing on his porch. When police arrived at Marocchi&#039;s home, they ordered him to keep his German shepherd and another dog, an Australian shepherd mix, inside. &quot;The owner allowed them to run out,&quot; Ledford said. The black-and-brown Australian shepherd mix, named Rusty, escaped and hasn&#039;t been found. The German shepherd charged at an officer, who was unable to deploy a Taser to subdue the dog, Ledford said. Then the German shepherd leaped at another officer, who knocked the dog down and shot twice with a handgun, killing it, he added. Marocchi said he never saw Max charge the first officer or any attempt by the officer to deploy a Taser. It only took a few seconds for Max to run from the house to a neighbor&#039;s driveway, where it was shot, said Marocchi, who believes that didn&#039;t allow for enough time for a second attack on a police officer. However, Marocchi admits he only heard gunfire and didn&#039;t see the actual shooting. Marocchi added that when he looked over at Max, the dog was dead in his neighbor&#039;s driveway and the police officer who shot him was about 6 feet away.\r\nThere was no report of the dog injuring any of the officers, Ledford said. Marocchi said he was kept handcuffed in a patrol car for about 90 minutes but wasn&#039;t arrested in connection with the initial man-with-a-gun complaint. The man-with-a-gun-incident investigation will be screened by the Weber County Attorney&#039;s Office to determine if any charges should be filed, Ledford said. Ogden police officials will also conduct an internal investigation into the shooting of Marocchi&#039;s dog. Police in Ogden also shot and killed a pit bull in January 2012 in the 1000 block of Patterson Avenue.

Police were trying to determine if she was injured by debris from the roadway or from a bullet fragment after the round struck the pavement and curb. Three officers said they were in the 1000 block of Patterson Street about 2 p.m. investigating an incident when an unleashed pit bull charged at them from a nearby backyard.

The dog, Copper, had been shot by a police officer in Radford&#039;s Bisset Park a day earlier during a response to a call about two dogs not on leashes. Radford Police Chief Don Goodman said that based on the report, the use of the gun was for the officer&#039;s safety. The dog was shot Thursday afternoon, when an officer was called to the park at 3:25 p.m., he said. Accounts of the story differ after that point.\r\nDeMasi, an 18-year-old Radford University student, said he and a friend were in a secluded area of Bisset Park down a slope, allowing their dogs to play by the riverbank. He said Copper saw the officer, who&#039;d approached from above, and ran over to greet him. DeMasi said the officer yelled for him to get his dog. But before DeMasi had the chance to make a move, he said, the officer shot Copper in the leg without further warning. Goodman said the officer, whose name wasn&#039;t made available Friday, was charged by the dog as he got out of his vehicle. The officer repeatedly urged the owners to call off their dogs, Goodman said. The dogs continued at the officer in an &quot;aggressive manner,&quot; Goodman said, so the officer drew his .45-caliber pistol and shot the dog in the right front leg. Both dog owners were charged with allowing an animal to run at large, which violates a Radford city ordinance, Goodman said. &quot;If the dog would have been on a leash, this incident wouldn&#039;t have occurred,&quot; the police chief said. DeMasi admitted that he had violated the leash ordinance, but he called the incident &quot;police brutality at its finest.&quot; &quot;There was no barking or growling, that&#039;s the thing,&quot; DeMasi said. &quot;They weren&#039;t at a full sprint; they were jogging toward him wagging their tails,&quot; he said. &quot;As soon as I see them, I start screaming. Before I could get any words out, the shot went off.&quot; The officer helped escort the dog to the vet&#039;s office, where DeMasi was issued a summons. DeMasi said going to the secluded area of Bisset Park is something he and his friends do at least once a week to give their dogs a chance to play. He said they&#039;ve never had problems before, because the spot is at a riverbank away from other people and dogs. A disagreement with another dog owner over the dogs being off their leashes prompted the call, DeMasi said. His biggest complaints centered on what he saw to be excessive use of force and a lack of compassion, DeMasi said. The officer had other visible weapons, such as pepper spray and a Taser, which should have been considered before the use of a firearm, he said. Further, DeMasi said, someone trained in animal control should have been dispatched instead of a police officer. Goodman said that routinely, such a situation would have ended with a warning or a ticket. The dog allegedly charging makes it a different situation, he said. &quot;He [the officer] probably would have just told him to &#039;put your dog on a leash,&#039; and we probably would have gone about our business,&quot; Goodman said. He also said that less lethal options, such as a baton, pepper spray and Taser are designed primarily to &quot;deal with combative people.&quot; Goodman also said that those weapons are used in close proximity, which is something the officer wasn&#039;t afforded. Any incident involving use of force is internally reviewed, to make sure policy was followed, Goodman said. No administrative action has been taken against the officer, and outside of the review, the incident, for all intents and purposes, is over, he said. DeMasi said he didn&#039;t feel that the officer&#039;s safety was threatened and doesn&#039;t want the incident treated like a typical dog attack story. &quot;It was a really messed-up situation,&quot; he said. DeMasi said his vet bill so far is $500 and his ticket cost him $150. Julie Magyar with Riverside Veterinary Clinic said the dog will have to recuperate but will be fine. The bullet went through Copper&#039;s leg and caused some damage to the elbow, she said. Magyar said the dog should be in a cast for six to 10 weeks.

The officer shot and killed a chocolate Labrador named Sonic at a residence in the Eastern Hills subdivision on Nov. 3. TPD spokesman Sgt. Brent Blankley said that the officer felt threatened and thought the dog was a Pit bull-Labrador mix. Owner Rebecca James said that her dog was an eight-year-old full-blooded chocolate Lab that never showed aggression. &ldquo;Sonic was an inside dog, we had just let her out to go to the bathroom and she ran up the street with a neighbor&rsquo;s dog that morning. She was a sweet dog who liked everyone,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That police officer shot an innocent dog four times. He shouldn&rsquo;t be on the police force, because to me, that is not a stable person.&rdquo; The officer was taking a break at 7:26 a.m. when Sonic and another dog, which the officers described as a Pit bull, approached as he disembarked his motorcycle, Blankley said. &ldquo;The large brown dog was snarling and baring his teeth while running toward the officer,&rdquo; Blankley wrote in a press release issued Tuesday morning. &ldquo;When the dog got within 13 feet of the officer, he had no choice but shoot the vicious dog for his own safety. He shot the dog one time and the dog fell to the ground, but got up and kept coming towards the officer. The officer shot the dog a second time to stop him from attacking him. The officer then shot the dog two additional times to stop the suffering of the animal.&rdquo;\r\nThe other dog left the property as soon as the first shot was fired, Blankley said.\r\nJames&rsquo; sister-in-law Tana James agreed that Sonic was not vicious. &ldquo;She was overweight. She was eight-years-old and had hip dysplasia so she couldn&rsquo;t leap, jump or do a lot of active things,&rdquo; said James, who manages a veterinary clinic. &ldquo;In all the years I&rsquo;ve been around her, I&rsquo;ve never seen any aggression. I&rsquo;ve never seen her growl or lurch at anyone.&rdquo; She said that the other dog is a Boxer named Izzy that lives next door to her sister-in-law and her husband. &ldquo;She is a small, white Boxer who just gave birth to puppies,&rdquo; James said. &ldquo;They were always together.&rdquo; Rebecca James had placed missing dog fliers around the neighborhood and received a call Monday from a neighbor who told her about the shooting.

I&rsquo;m an adult, and I don&rsquo;t want to see it.&rdquo; Police Chief Michael Freeman offered a different version of events, maintaining the raccoon was not shot near any children or dwellings by Humane Officer Barry Accorti, who estimated he shot the animal at least 70 yards from any house.\r\nFreeman said Accorti shot the animal after determining there were no children present. Accorti, the same humane officer involved in the kitten incident in 2013, followed the law, according to Freeman. &ldquo;The property owner set a trap (which was requested from the city) and called us when he had something in the trap,&rdquo; Freeman said. &ldquo;He gave us permission to take care of the animal on his property.&rdquo; &ldquo;Because a neighbor disagrees with it doesn&rsquo;t make it wrong,&rdquo; Freeman said of the incident.\r\nFreeman said the animal was shot with .22-caliber ammunition that was fired toward the ground. &ldquo;This is a highly-trained individual who can make deductions as to whether this can be done safely or not,&rdquo; Freeman said. &ldquo;He is a certified officer. Not somebody we just hire off the street, give them a gun, and tell them to go to it.&rdquo; Under Ohio Department of Natural Resources regulations, animals can be caught and then released or destroyed by a property owner, or permission can be given by a property owner to have an animal destroyed by another party, such as a humane officer. Accorti became a humane officer in 2012 after retiring as a North Ridgeville police officer with 31 years&rsquo; service as a patrolman, detective, SWAT team commander and lieutenant. Over the years he received many commendations. An adult raccoon and number of baby raccoons were removed by the city from the neighbor&rsquo;s property last week, according to Sherrill. It was June 10, 2013, when Accorti shot and killed five kittens in response to a homeowner&rsquo;s request for help in ridding her property of stray cats, which have posed a problem in the city. That incident occurred at a residence where young children were present but did not witness the actual shooting, which triggered protest from angry residents demanding Accorti&rsquo;s firing, threats of legal action by humane groups, and thousands of signers to online petitions demanding action, including Accorti&rsquo;s dismissal. Accorti&rsquo;s actions at the time were deemed appropriate by Freeman. The episode led the city to announce it would no longer dispatch police or humane officers to handle feral cat calls, and to the formation of a citizens advisory committee in hopes of developing a better means of reducing the city&rsquo;s numbers of stray or feral cats.','http://chronicle.northcoastnow.com/2014/06/10/parent-alleges-humane-control-officer-killed-raccoon-front-kids/','Unknown','Barry Accorti','','No',1,0,0,'NA','NA','Uniform','No','NA','No','No','No','No'),(828,'2014-03-14','Alabama','Mobile','City of Mobile Police Department',2,2,0,'Unconfirmed','&quot;My guess is when he walked up to this point here he went to go around the corner and saw them and immediately reacted, because they were after him which they&#039;re supposed to,&quot; saiid Mark Yeager.

Music told policestateusa.com that it was a Nissan Xterra from Virginia Beach, VA. As Music wrote in a blog post, &ldquo;I will not have that influence around my family,&rdquo; saying she was trying to do the right thing by making a report. The acquaintance was still on the property and Music had not let on that she had gone to talk to the police. Music wrote on that while she was providing officers with details of the stolen property, and the individual who had brought it over, she also explicitly told the police not to shoot her dogs. &ldquo;The puppy may jump, we have been trying to get her out of that,&rdquo; Music explained, stating that the dogs were friendly puppies.  She said the officers laughed and told her not to worry about it.  Unconvinced, she emphasized again:  &ldquo;PLEASE don&rsquo;t shoot my dogs, they are my babies.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ammo was just sniffing around the ground wagging her tail. And then she looked up at him, did not growl, did not bark, and before I could say anything he fired his weapon. Shot her point blank in the head.&rdquo; The officers asked her to stay at the station while units were sent to her home to obtain the property and arrest the individual who may have stolen it.  Her dogs, Ammo and Half-Pint, and roommate, Kyle Sewall, age 22, waited at home.  Sewall gave his account in an exclusive interview with policestateusa.com. &ldquo;I was waiting on officers to arrive, Ammo needed to go the bathroom and she had been whimpering for 15 minutes.  So I gave in and let her out,&rdquo; said Sewall.  &ldquo;The person who had stolen the property was outside cleaning the stolen vehicle with a shop-vac and while I kept an eye on Ammo I was talking to him playing it cool.&rdquo; He continued: &ldquo;About 5 minutes later is when the sheriffs pulled up, came flying in. Sgt David Little was exiting the vehicle and as he was exiting I noticed he already had his sidearm trained on Ammo who was just sniffing around the ground wagging her tail. And then she looked up at him, did not growl, did not bark, and before I could say anything he fired his weapon. Shot her point blank in the head,&rdquo; Sewall told policestateusa.com. &ldquo;I went to go rush toward Ammo and he trained his weapon on me,&rdquo; Sewall explained. &ldquo;I identified myself saying, &lsquo;I am Kyle, lower your weapon.&rsquo; He did and they allowed me to tend to Ammo.&rdquo; Ammo, the 10-month-old pit bull / mastiff puppy, had been struck in the head with a .40 caliber slug, fired by Sergeant David Little of the Jones County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department. While Sewall tended to the wounded animal, officers investigated the vehicle and arrested the man who was in possession of it.  Animal Control showed up and asked if Sewall wanted to euthanize the dog.  Sewall declined. Some time later, Music returned to the home after being allowed to leave the sheriff&rsquo;s office.  She found Sewall behind a kiddy pool with a strange look on his face.  He was cradling her puppy in his arms. &ldquo;They shot her,&rdquo; Sewall said. Music asked Sgt. Little why he had shot her dog, after she had explained to him and other deputies that it was a friendly, harmless puppy, and explicitly had asked him not to shoot it.  Music says that Sgt. Little denied that she had told him this, but that an accompanying deputy confirmed her account. Rather than continue to argue she quickly scrambled to make emergency arrangements to have Ammo treated by a veterinarian on a Sunday. She found an animal hospital and got her dog X-rayed and bandaged up.  The bullet had traveled down the dog&rsquo;s skull into its neck, where it disappeared from the X-ray.  She relayed on Facebook, &ldquo;They said that Ammo NEEDS this surgery to survive. We need at LEAST $800.00 for the surgery.&rdquo; Music contacted Captain Mitchell of the Jones County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department, whom she says told her that the dog was shot because it &ldquo;charged at&rdquo; Sgt. Little, which contradicts Sewall&rsquo;s eyewitness account. It was only a year ago when Sgt. D. Little shot another dog in Jones County; an American Bulldog named Eden. &ldquo;It is officers like Sgt. Little, who lack discipline and necessary training and firearm safety, that pose a threat to the very people that they swore and took an oath to protect,&rdquo; Sewall told policestateusa.com. Ammo&#039;s surgery was completed successfully and Ammo has apparently recovered from her wounds.','http://www.13wmaz.com/story/news/local/gray-jones/2013/11/03/3424297/','Ammo','David Little','No','Yes',0,0,0,'No','Not Sure','Uniform','Yes','Yes','Not Sure','Not Sure','Not Sure','Not Sure'),(830,'2012-05-25','Georgia','Macon','Jones County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department',1,50,1,'American Bulldog','My dog, Eden, was an American Bulldog shot and killed by Jones County Sheriff deputy, XXXXX XXXXXttle Jr. on 5/25/2012. She was merely on my neighbors property across from my mothers home where they were kept confined since 2008. The deputy&#039;s prejudice against pit bulls lead him to react instead of investigate. He claimed Eden became aggressive after she was pepper sprayed, and began to attack him when he turned to enter his patrol car. Thus, turning to her with his weapon drawn firing one shot in which he claim was the shoulder. The Animal control officer was called after the shooting to find Eden lying paralyzed waist down still breathing. My dogs did not have a collar on them because they were fenced inside. It happened on a Memorial Day weekend, and I could not contact the Animal Control Office until Tuesday 5/29/2012. I have filed a complaint with the Sheriff&#039;s department, sent Eden for a legal necropsy. The Jones County Deputy suffered no injuries. My American bulldogs were fenced in a 10 X 10 on my mothers property. Prior to that they had full run of her back yard until the house caught fire Aug 2011, forcing me to put them in a small 10X10. I did not have them with a collar in their pen, and I did not have them with a microchip. Since 2008 they have only escaped the property twice. This last time they were on a parrallel street and the neighbor claim the dogs were aggresive to him and he called the Jones County Sheriff department. According to them, the dogs did not bite anyone, or destroy any property. Reportedly, they were barking aggressively at the other neighbors dog behind the neighbors fence. The deputy reported that the dogs approached him as he exited his patrol car to investigates the neighbors complaint. He then stated he attempted to close his patrol car door when the dogs approached him. He drew his pepper spray to shoo the dogs away is what he claimed. My male dog, Caleb laid down while the female Eden continued her approach then backed off. He stated he then turned toward his vehicle when Eden approached him aggressively, so he drew his weapon and fired. Hitting her in the shoulder. Animal Control was notified after the shooting to the scene. When they arrived on scene, ACO (Animal Control Officer) Jennifer, stated Eden was near death and paralyzed, but was still breathing. She stated that Caleb was stand offish at that point but he was captured and held at the animal shelter until Tuesday 5/29/2012. The ACO claim she did not have any knowledge of the owner, so she had to euthanize Eden. ACO Jennifer surrendered Caleb to my mother after verifying with my veterinarian that his shots were current. She later waived all fines and fees surrounding the event when she released Eden&#039;s body to me on 6/7/2012 We got permission from our employer in Dutch Harbor, Alaska to pick up Caleb from Macon, Georgia and bring him back with us on 6/12/2012. After speaking with Capt Mitchell of Jones County Sheriff, he felt his deputy responded appropriately. I asked him whether there were any reports of my dog biting anyone? Did the deputy have any training in responding to aggressive dog calls? Is the deputy qualified to determine an aggressive dog, or is their a hearing required? What is the departments policy for notifying Animal Control, and why didn&#039;t he wait until they arrive before conducting his investigation? Capt. Mitchell was unable to answer my questions. The ACO stated that Eden was found shot at the front of the neighbors car, and Caleb was found at the rear. That gave me the impression that the dogs did not approach the officer but he in turn approached them. ACO Jennifer claimed there were no records kept by her on her response to the call, nor did she keep track of what time she was dispatched, or what time she was on scene. If I wanted those records, I would have to go through the sheriff&#039;s department which she claimed she didn&#039;t have. I spoke to the clerk at the sheriff&#039;s department, and she claimed the person responsible for the 911 recordings was out of town. All in all, I am getting a run around from the sheriff&#039;s department to my veterinarian. My own vet documented that my dog was a pit bull until I showed him the certificate of her breed being American bulldog. I had them to correct all her records. Eden is currently getting a legal necropsy at Tifton University here in Georgia. Jones S.O. Incident Report reads as follow: On 5-25-12 I responded toXXXXX in reference to some aggressive dogs. Upon arrival to the residence I made contact with two large pitbull dogs under the carport of the residence. The dogs came out and walked around my patrol and approached me on the rear driver side.

I next closed the door on my patrol vehicle. I walked about 10ft in front of my patrol vehicle to speak with the complainant Tirrell Lester. He stated that the dogs were aggressive with him when he attempted to come outside. He stated they also went to his neighbors house at 146 and attempted to get at a dog there.

It happened a week ago in Kalihi after officers responded to a domestic call in the area. As police officers were about to leave, Bruce, a two-year-old Staffordshire Bull Terrier mix, got loose from his cage and lunged at the officers, and then got shot. When the family asked police if they could take the dog to the veterinarian, they were told to stay put until an investigation was completed.\r\nThe first thing KHON2 News asked HPD was why the family was forced to wait. We were told it&rsquo;s standard policy to do a thorough investigation after an officer fires a weapon, so the scene had to be preserved. So we then asked that if this were instead a person, would there be a delay in getting help? Late Friday afternoon, a HPD spokeswoman called back and said the officers made a mistake and should have allowed the family to get medical help for the dog. One week after being shot in the chest, Bruce looks almost as good as new, although there are some stitches that still need to help him heal. His owners still can&rsquo;t believe what they had just gone through.\r\n&ldquo;It was terrifying for all of us,&rdquo; said the dog&rsquo;s owner Kristen Butac. &ldquo;We never would have thought this would happen to us. He&rsquo;s our family, so of course we&rsquo;re going react the way we did. We&rsquo;re upset.&rdquo; Butac said three officers were walking outside the house when Bruce lunged at them. The first two managed to sidestep and avoid the dog, but the third officer fired a shot. An HPD spokeswoman said the officer described the dog as aggressive and vicious. When asked how much was the dog bleeding, Butac said &ldquo;well, to us, it seemed like a lot. I mean, seeing something like that, of course, you&rsquo;re panicking. You don&rsquo;t know what else could have happened.&rdquo; She said the officers would not let anyone leave the house, even as they pleaded to let someone take Bruce to the vet. But they were told nobody leaves until the investigation is finished, which took about an hour. Investigators found the shell casing, but they couldn&rsquo;t find the bullet, which made the family even more nervous, thinking that it could still be inside the dog&rsquo;s chest. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t know what other injuries he had, so we were just trying our best to just put  pressure on his wound,&rdquo; Butac said. After the family rushed Bruce to an emergency care veterinarian, they did get some good news. &ldquo;The vet said he was a very lucky dog. What happened was the bullet had entered and exited his chest. The only damage was to his soft tissues.&rdquo; The family plans to file a lawsuit against HPD. Investigators are reviewing the case to initiate some type of policy.','http://khon2.com/2014/09/12/family-outraged-after-their-pet-dog-was-shot-by-police/','Bruce','Three Unknown Police','No','Yes',2,0,0,'No','Not Sure','Uniform','No','Not Sure','Not Sure','Not Sure','Not Sure','No'),(832,'2012-09-14','Nevada','Las Vegas','North Las Vegas Police Department SWAT',2,50,1,'Pit Bull','A Las Vegas couple claim North Las Vegas police violated their civil rights in 2012 by fatally shooting their dogs.

According to the lawsuit, the Police Department unlawfully permits its officers &ldquo;to shoot pet dogs during the execution of search warrants even though there are no reasonable justifications to shoot the dogs.&rdquo; Walker and Cataldo were living at 6253 Rocky Mountain Ave. with their two pit bulls, Pinky and Blue, when North Las Vegas SWAT officers served a drug search warrant on Sept. 14, 2012, at the home near Carey Avenue and Hollywood Boulevard, according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit claims the dogs were running toward the backyard, away from the officers, when they were shot. It describes Pinky as &ldquo;just a puppy.&rdquo; &ldquo;The dogs did not bark, approach, or come into contact with the officers at any time,&rdquo; the document alleges.

They said they remember their pet as a large, friendly lap dog. Tulsa Police Sgt. Jeff Davis said the off-duty officer was walking his own dog in the 6900 block of East 18th Street late Thursday afternoon when the pit bull, which was loose, approached his pet. Davis said the officer felt threatened, so he shot the dog, killing it. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an unfortunate thing,&rdquo; Davis said. Grant Holm, 50, lives three doors down from where the shooting occurred. Holm witnessed the situation as he, his wife and their grandchild spoke outside with a neighbor. Holm said he saw Titus run from between two houses on the other side of the street toward him with his tail wagging but then shift directions toward the officer when it saw two other dogs. The officer was walking with a large dog on a leash and was with a woman who had a small dog on a leash, Holm said. Titus went to the large dog and appeared to be greeting the other animal from a submissive posture with its head down, Holm said. The officer pulled on his dog&rsquo;s leash, rearing the animal up onto its hind legs, Holm said. Titus then moved to fill the void created by the officer pulling on the leash, he said. &ldquo;The man, as smooth as you please, reached behind him, pointed (a handgun), put it up to the dog and shot it in the head or neck area, and Titus immediately went down,&rdquo; Holm said, noting that the officer didn&rsquo;t say a word before pulling the trigger. As Titus lay in the grass, moving his legs and yelping, &ldquo;he (the officer) bent down, aimed at it and shot it in the head with everybody in shock,&rdquo; Holm said, adding that the second and final shot sent adults scurrying to collect children and take them inside their homes. Holm said he took issue with what he believes to be the officer&rsquo;s unwarranted shooting of a friendly dog. Holm said he doesn&rsquo;t know why the officer didn&rsquo;t try to get Titus to stop, ask any of the many people outside if the dog was theirs, or simply holler for help.\r\nHe said he also doesn&rsquo;t know why the officer needed to walk over and shoot Titus a second time when the animal already was lying on the ground severely wounded.\r\n&ldquo;I might have seen it differently if they were fighting, but there was no fighting,&rdquo; Holm said, also saying there was no barking or growling. On Friday afternoon, Blazek and Slane were trying to cope with the loss of their pet. The couple, who have been dating for almost a year and live together, didn&rsquo;t witness the shooting. Slane, 26, said she was inside their home and Blazek was away when Blazek&rsquo;s brother, Joseph Blazek, let Titus and the couple&rsquo;s other dog into the backyard, which is enclosed by a 6-foot-tall privacy fence. Just that morning, however, Titus had found a way to get out through a small opening in the fence, Slane said. Slane said that was how Titus escaped from the yard. Nicholas Blazek, 26, said he has owned Titus since bringing him home as a puppy. He said Titus was large, weighing about 60 to 65 pounds, but was a friendly dog who would sleep in bed with them. He recalled how a friend with a 2-year-old daughter would come over and the youngster would ride Titus like a horse.\r\n&ldquo;He was just a big goober &mdash; a big lap dog,&rdquo; Blazek said. He said Titus had never shown aggression. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s never even been in a dog fight,&rdquo; he said. After Titus was shot, Blazek was ticketed for having a dog at large. The owners have the option of paying the preset fine of $75 or having a hearing in municipal court, Davis said.\r\nDavis, who declined to release the name of the officer, said he won&rsquo;t be placed on administrative leave because he was off-duty and the shooting didn&rsquo;t involve a person. Leland Ashley, a Tulsa police spokesman, said the incident will be treated the same as a citizen shooting an animal when threatened. Ashley also noted that the officer used his personal firearm, not a police-issued weapon. Slane and her boyfriend said Friday that they want justice for Titus and for the officer to be reprimanded. &ldquo;It was definitely an unjust, unnecessary, horrible event,&rdquo; she said.','http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/local/witness-owners-of-pit-bull-killed-by-off-duty-tulsa/article_400fc734-6d16-51cb-8748-e188852b8ab1.html','Titus','Unknown','','No',1,0,0,'No','Yes','Plain Clothes','NA','NA','Not Sure','Not Sure','Not Sure','Not Sure'),(834,'2013-11-10','Georgia','Atlanta','Atlanta Police Department',1,10,1,'Labrador and Pit Bull mix 2yo','Last November, a dog in Atlanta was killed by a City of Atlanta Police Department officer. According to their Facebook: Justice for Jane Our Family Dog page, the family learned last week that the officer involved has been cleared of any wrong doing. After an Internal Affairs investigation, Investigator Art Nixon along with his supervisors, ruled Officer Brian Carswell of the City of Atlanta Police Department completely justified in murdering Jane in her fenced-in front yard on a quiet Sunday morning. This tragic story began November 10, 2013, when the family of slain pit bull Jane, Matthew and Kelley Rodriguez, was saying goodbye to relatives visiting them from North Carolina. During the excitement of packing, an 11-year-old girl accidentally dialed 911. Emergency dispatch called the family back, and the niece confirmed it had been an accidental call. An hour later police arrived at the house, where they knocked once without identifying themselves. Kelley was nursing her three-month-old baby upstairs, and thought the visiting family had returned to pick up an item perhaps missed during their packing. The family dogs, Jane and Lucy, were lying with her on the bed. Kelley shouted that she was coming to the door, and when she opened the door leading outside, the dogs ran out. At the time, the City of Atlanta police officers had their backs turned, but quickly turned around and drew their weapons. Officer Brian Carswell allegedly shot Jane from the gate, while the dog was on the steps of the home, several feet away. Another officer had his weapon aimed at Lucy. If not for the fast thinking of Kelley, Lucy, too would have been executed. Kelley quickly picked Lucy up, where she carried the surviving dog upstairs, where she feared for the safety of her family. &quot;I ran up the stairs to get my infant son as I was terrified, and from the upstairs balcony I started to yell, You killed my dog! Why did you come here to kill my dog!!!??? I couldn&#039;t believe what was happening!&quot; Both dogs were rescues, and very much loved by family and neighbors alike. These neighbors, who all knew Jane and Lucy, gathered outside the yard in disbelief. To make matters worse, the officers wouldn&#039;t allow anyone to come near Jane, not even to transport her for emergency treatment. It wasn&#039;t until more officer&#039;s arrived that Kelley was able to give permission to a neighbor to take Jane to a vet. By then it was too late. Kelley couldn&#039;t even be with her dog as she took her last breath. She had to remain with her infant, but was able to contact Matthew, who was on a charity bike ride at the time. Jane died from her injuries. &quot;I cannot express what we feel. We keep playing this over and over. There was no reason that the Officer had to kill Jane. She was a friendly dog, everyone loved her, and she did not give him any reason to feel threatened.&quot; Justice for Jane didn&#039;t happen with the internal investigation. The Rodriguez will now join the families of other dogs slain by police, and spread the word about just how often a family dog is murdered by police. Jane was shot by police in her own yard, while police officer&#039;s were at the gate, then denied emergency veterinary care until it was too late.

Richard Chrisman was originally charged with aggravated assault, second-degree murder and animal cruelty.\r\nHe was convicted in September of assault, but jurors failed to reach verdicts on the other counts. He later pleaded guilty to manslaughter in a deal with prosecutors that spared him a second trial. Judge Warren Granville sentenced him Friday to seven years in prison for manslaughter and five years on the assault conviction with both sentences to run concurrently. While noting that Chrisman was doing his job, the judge also said he went too far. &quot;Society entrusted you with the power and authority of a law enforcement officer,&quot; Granville told Chrisman. &quot;On this occasion, you failed to meet that responsibility.&quot; Chrisman was arrested after he shot and killed Danny Rodriguez, 28, and the man&#039;s pit bull when he and his partner responded to Rodriguez&#039;s home after a frantic call from his mother that her son was acting violent. Chrisman maintained the shootings were self-defense but his partner told jurors the situation had been defused before Chrisman opened fire. At his sentencing hearing, Rodriguez&#039;s mother tearfully pleaded with the judge to sentence Chrisman to the maximum of 15 years in prison. &quot;I feel so guilty,&quot; Elvira Fernandez told the judge. &quot;If I never picked up that telephone and made that call, Daniel would be alive today.&quot; Several police officers testified on Chrisman&#039;s behalf, calling him a good man who supported his colleagues and loved his job. &quot;I&#039;ve never seen him lose his temper on or off the job,&quot; Phoenix officer Matt Morgan said. Chrisman pleaded for leniency, calling the events of that day a tragedy. &quot;But I would ask that you understand that that tragedy reaches both sides,&quot; he said. Outside court, Fernandez said she was disappointed with the sentence. &quot;It just didn&#039;t seem fair,&quot; she said, holding back tears. Chrisman had the support throughout his case of the Phoenix Law Enforcement Association, which found his conviction to be a travesty of justice. &quot;Rich is kind of an unfortunate victim of the justice system,&quot; said Ken Crane, the union&#039;s vice president. &quot;He was just trying to do his job.&quot; During his trial, Chrisman described a chaotic scene in which his partner shirked his duties as backup while Rodriguez&#039;s pit bull became aggressive. He said that at one point, the dog lunged at him leading him to shoot the animal twice. Chrisman explained how pepper spray and his stun gun failed to subdue the suspect as the two struggled, and Rodriguez picked up a bicycle from the living room floor. &quot;He was going to smash my brains in ... I fired two rounds, center mass,&quot; Chrisman told jurors. Prosecutors accused him of being reckless and escalating the situation unnecessarily. Defense attorneys noted that Chrisman had never fired his weapon once during 10 years on the force and was defending himself. But Chrisman&#039;s partner, Sergio Virgillo, told jurors Chrisman was on a tear from the moment he approached Rodriguez&#039;s door, then pulled out his gun and pressed it to the suspect&#039;s head. Chrisman denied the allegations and accused Virgillo of not being there to help with the struggling suspect, who was high on methamphetamine, and at one point even taking a personal call on his cell phone during the incident. Chrisman was fired about five months after the shooting. Virgillo remains employed with the Phoenix Police Department. Chrisman had previously been caught on video planting a crack cocaine pipe on a woman - an event that landed him on the Brady List of police officers proven to have lied under oath.','http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/bastard/2010/11/richard_chrisman_phoenix_police_department.php','Junior','Richard Chrisman and Sergio Virgillo','Yes','No',0,0,1,'No','No','Uniform','Yes','Not Sure','Yes','Yes','Not Sure','Yes'),(836,'2013-08-15','Massachusetts','Leominster','Leominster Police Department',1,2,0,'Unconfirmed','Fifteen-year-old Kassidy Edwards can&rsquo;t forget the horrific sound. &ldquo;It was just two big loud popping noises right after each other and there was nothing after that,&rdquo; she describes. Those popping noises? Police shooting a dog who was hit by a car because they couldn&rsquo;t find its owner or anyone to help. Kassidy and her mother say they discovered the dog hit by a car on their Leominster street early in one morning this spring and called police for help. They say the police responded right away and police began trying to find the dog&rsquo;s owner or a kennel or an animal control officer to come take the dog. Police say they did all they could, but because Leominster had no animal control officer, and no other neighboring community&rsquo;s officer could help, they shot and killed the dog. They say the dog was seriously injured and they called Fitchburg&rsquo;s Animal Control officer to take custody but they couldn&rsquo;t respond. They tried all of the local animal shelters and the dog was dying so they were advised as a last resort to shoot it. Kassidy says, &ldquo;It was sad, the dog got shot, they didn&rsquo;t know what else to do so they had to take the dog into the woods and shoot him.&rdquo;\r\nState officials say this never would have happened if Leominster had an animal control officer. The say the officer could have come to the scene and taken the dog away. MSPCA Chief Richard LeBlond says he was stunned to learn the City of Leominster would be without an animal control officer for a year. Chief LeBlond says, &ldquo;In this age it shouldn&rsquo;t be happening.&rdquo; We contacted city leaders for answers. Leominster Purchasing Agent Greg Chapdelaine says they had difficulty finding someone to fill the role, but after a year-long search, they hired an animal control officer that started August 1st.

Cora, who received an entry/exit injury to her left leg, was immediately transported to a veterinarian and underwent surgery. The veterinarian reported she will fully recover and should not have any complications, Davis said. Cora, a $13,000 department asset who was purchased in 2011 with a grant, received medication and will be off duty for 2 weeks while she heals, the chief said. She is about 2 years old and the department&#039;s only K-9. She is used to detect drugs and explosives and locate suspects, missing people or objects. A member of the Southeast Mississippi Metropolitan Enforcement Team accidentally shot her, Davis said, while executing a search warrant at about 7:30 p.m. at a home on Woodlawn Avenue, on the west side of the city. Prior to the search warrant, agents had learned there were vicious dogs at the residence, the chief said. &quot;As the members of the team entered the targeted residence and made contact with the targets of the investigation, K-9 officer Cora broke away from the handler and ran into the residence,&quot; Davis said in a statement. &quot;K-9 officer Cora mistakenly attacked 1 of the plain clothed narcotics agents and bit him on the leg.&quot; The agent thought he was being attacked by a vicious animal, Davis said, so he fired a round. Inside the home, agents recovered a large amount of cocaine and marijuana. At least 1 person has been charged with felony possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute, Davis said, but no names are being released due to the ongoing investigation. Moss Point has requested an independent investigation of the shooting incident to be completed by an outside agency. The Metropolitan Enforcement Team was created by Moss Point, Pascagoula and Gautier authorities in 2012 to combat drugs in their cities and is made up of officers from each department.

The officer&rsquo;s report claims the shooting was justified; however, the owners call the incident an execution of a friendly, family pet. Mike McKnight obtained surveillance video of the incident for a Fact Finders exclusive. On October 7th, after midnight, police blocked a street in the area of 35th and Vinton to look for an armed suspect. They say Chris Schulte, who lives in the area, ignored orders to stop and walked the family dog toward the search area. He was arrested and his dog, Teela, shot. Chris Schulte said, &ldquo;You know I should have got back but I was just walking on. Not threatening, dog wasn&#039;t being aggressive.&rdquo; In the report by Officer Schuster and Officer Clement, the officers said &ldquo;suspect&rsquo;s dog became aggressive, growled at officers, and showed its teeth before being shot and killed.&rdquo; Tim Wagner told Channel 6 News he watched the incident, live, from inside his home via a night vision security camera. Wagner said, &ldquo;The dog didn&#039;t stand a chance. The dog did nothing aggressive. I&#039;ve lived next to this dog two and a half years and it&rsquo;s one of the best dogs.&rdquo; Fact Finders checked with the Nebraska Humane Society. Teela, a Labrador, golden retriever mix, had a clean record with no history of bites or vicious behavior. Schulte says Teela belonged to his aunt, Michelle Meadows. Meadows said, &ldquo;It was very shocking. I would think they would maybe taser her or something, if they thought she was being aggressive, but I don&#039;t think she was.&rdquo; The police report described Schulte as intoxicated. He was arrested, at the scene, for obstructing police and resisting arrest. He claims Teela, who was still on a leash, didn&rsquo;t threaten to attack officers before one of them shot her. &ldquo;They didn&#039;t have to shoot em. Not at all.

Serna and Morales said they went outside and the officer approached them saying there had been a 911 call about a deceased woman. Morales then said the officer told him he was responding to the call from another family blocks away on another street, who had once lived in their house. Morales said the officer then told him 20 minutes later to check on his dog. According to Morales, the officer said, &ldquo;He trotted up to me after I turned the corner, came to my feet and I shot him.&rdquo; Morales said the officer described how he told the pit bull to get back, and when he didn&rsquo;t, he stepped back and fired his service revolver. However, the officer admitted to Morales the pit bull never growled at him. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if he meant to go straight down between the eyes or the top of the head, but it went from the mouth down,&rdquo; Morales said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s heartbreaking.

At Michael Dadio&rsquo;s house on George Street, his girlfriend&rsquo;s kids played in the back yard while his dad mowed the lawn. Then the cops showed up. They killed the family dog, tasered Michael Dadio Sr. and then arrested him &mdash; all because he didn&rsquo;t show up to court on DUI charges. (Dadio Sr. was not available for comment.) This overreaction by two East Haven police officers &mdash; in front of children &mdash; has upset neighbors on a street where many families own dogs. &ldquo;The way this happened was totally reckless,&rdquo; says Dadio Jr. He says he went to the police to complain and was told, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a dog.&rdquo; The shooting happened in May while the Department of Justice (DOJ) was investigating EHPD on complaints of racial profiling of Latinos. The DOJ&rsquo;s final report is expected sometime in July. The sergeant who killed the dog was the same one who signed off on the highly controversial arrest of a priest last year, which ignited national news coverage of complaints from area Latinos and the subsequent DOJ investigation. Dadio&rsquo;s story differs from the official police record. (The priest&rsquo;s account also differed from the police report in that 2009 case.) According to officer Jason Zullo&rsquo;s report, on May 22, he drove by the George Street home and &ldquo;immediately recognized Michael Dadio standing in front of his [son&rsquo;s] residence.&rdquo; Zullo knew Dadio had an arrest warrant for skipping court. (That&rsquo;s a misdemeanor. According to the state judicial website, Dadio has no convictions.) Sgt. John Miller and Zullo approached the house. &ldquo;Dadio immediately ran from officers in an attempt to elude capture when he saw the police vehicles arrive,&rdquo; according to the report. Zullo writes that Dadio ran to the back yard and Miller followed. Zullo went around the other side of the house. &ldquo;As officers gave chase, Sgt. Miller was confronted by an aggressive dog/pit bull forcing him to discharge his weapon,&rdquo; says the report. The report does not say that the dog chased, lunged at, intimidated or bit either of the officers. The back door to the house was wide open, says the report, and Dadio Sr. wasn&rsquo;t seen anywhere in the yard, so officers went inside to look for him and found him &ldquo;inside a cabinet under the kitchen sink.&rdquo; Then they tasered him after shouting at him to comply. Dadio says there&rsquo;s no way his dad would fit under the kitchen sink, and, there was no reason to taser him. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a harmless guy. My dad didn&rsquo;t even know there was a warrant for his arrest.&rdquo; Dadio admits that his dad ran from the cops. But that&rsquo;s because they got out of the police car with their guns drawn, he says. Dadio was outside next door and says he saw what happened. He says his dad went towards the back of the house, where the children were playing. The family&rsquo;s two dogs were barking, but are very well trained and both went through obedience school, he says. The German shepherd was on the back porch barking at the cops, when it was shot in front of the kids, who Dadio estimates were about 25 feet away. &ldquo;They could have killed the kids,&rdquo; says Dadio. After the shooting and the arrest, Dadio says more cops arrived. They blocked off the street and didn&rsquo;t let anyone enter the home for hours. Meanwhile, standing in the street, Dadio could hear his dog crying. He was so freaked out and upset, he says, that he left. The dog bled to death. The kids were so traumatized, says Dadio, that they wouldn&rsquo;t sleep at the house for days. Dadio is planning on filing a lawsuit. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not expecting any money, but I want something done to the officer. Suspend him or something.&rdquo; Neither Miller nor Zullo have been suspended, but an internal investigation is ongoing, says interim chief Gaetano Nappi. Several neighbors filed civilian complaints about the shooting, Nappi confirmed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d rather not harm anybody,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;If in fact [the shooting] was justifiable, it&rsquo;s an unfortunate circumstance of us doing our job.&rdquo;','http://www.informationliberation.com/?id=31241','Unknown','John Miller and Jason Zullo','Yes','No',1,0,0,'Yes','Yes','Uniform','Yes','Not Sure','No','No','Not Sure','No'),(845,'2009-03-12','Texas','Bruceville-Eddy','Bruceville-Eddy Police Department and McLennan County Sheriff&#039;s Office',1,2,1,'Unconfirmed','Family members were demanding answers Friday after officers killed a dog and then used a Taser to subdue the dog&rsquo;s elderly owner for refusing to obey a command to stop, only to learn afterward that the man was deaf and likely didn&rsquo;t hear the order.\r\nThe dog was one of two that chased a Bruceville-Eddy woman into her home and wouldn&rsquo;t let her come out late Thursday afternoon.

The other dog, a Rottweiler, began to approach when he heard someone from a nearby house calling for their dogs, the man told police. The man told police that when he returned home, he noticed his pit bull had suffered abrasions to its right hind leg, and he took the pet to a veterinarian for treatment.','http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2011/01/13/police-shoot-attacking-pit-bull-in-home/','Loco','Unknown','Yes','No',1,0,1,'No','No','Uniform','Yes','No','No','No','No','No'),(852,'2012-08-04','Illinois','South Elgin','South Elgin Police Department',1,2,1,'Unconfirmed','Police Sgt. Craig Steurer heard the cries for help as he arrived at a South Elgin home after responding to a 911 call of a dog attack. &quot;It sounded bad to me,&quot; he said of the radio call he heard Saturday afternoon. &quot;It just wasn&#039;t the normal bite and let go.&quot;Steurer eventually had to shoot to death a pit bull that was attacking a woman and had already bitten her young nephew. The dog belonged to the woman&#039;s roommate but had been living in the home for only about a week after its original owner moved from the area, Steurer said. When Steurer arrived at the home in the 0-99 block of Churchill Court, he walked in through the garage and heard the cries, which led him upstairs. &quot;I turned and looked. There was a medium-size brown pit bull,&quot; he said. The dog&#039;s mouth was clamped on the 41-year-old woman&#039;s forearm. She &quot;was covered head to toe in smeared blood,&quot; Steurer said. The dog was &quot;actively chewing and pulling on her right arm. I was thinking, what am I going to do to get this dog off of her?&quot; Steurer said he grabbed the dog by its neck, which caused it to let go of the woman. &quot;He dug his feet in, turned his head &hellip; toward me and growled,&quot; Steurer said. Fearing another attack, Steurer said he decided to shoot the dog. At that point, other officers had arrived and tended to the woman, who was taken to Provena St. Joseph Hospital in Elgin and later transported to Advocate Lutheran General Hospital in Park Ridge. Officers also found the woman&#039;s 5-year-old nephew and 11-year-old niece in a bedroom. Steurer said the dog first attacked the boy and then turned on the woman after she intervened. The boy&#039;s sister brought him into a bedroom, shut the door and called 911, Steurer said. The boy suffered bites to his arm and hand. The woman remains hospitalized but is expected to recover, according to Sgt. Mike Doty. Her nephew was also hospitalized but has been released. The family could not be reached for comment Wednesday afternoon. It&#039;s unclear what caused the dog to attack the boy. Steurer said it was not his first incident with a pit bull. Last September, he responded to a call with a colleague &mdash; one of the same officers who responded to Saturday&#039;s attack &mdash; and encountered two pit bulls. One of the dogs charged Steurer&#039;s fellow officer, biting her heel and armpit. In that case, Steurer said he felt &quot;helpless&quot; because he could not shoot the dog without injuring the officer. The officer shot and killed the dog while it was attacking her, Steurer said. &quot;That also went through my mind&quot; during Saturday&#039;s attack, he said. &quot;The damage these things can do.&quot; Since Saturday&#039;s attack, Steurer said he spoke with the woman&#039;s brother, who expressed his gratitude. &quot;It was several people coming together,&quot; Steurer said. &quot;Not just me.&quot;','http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-08-08/news/ct-met-south-elgin-pitbull-20120809_1_pit-bull-dog-attack-steurer','Unknown','Craig Steurer','Yes','No',1,1,0,'No','No','Uniform','Yes','Not Sure','No','No','No','No'),(853,'2011-08-07','Illinois','Elgin','Elgin Police Department',1,2,1,'Unconfirmed','The following is based entirely on police statements: A different pit bull was shot in the 400 block of North Worth Avenue about 11 a.m. after police responded to reports of a loose dog, according to police department spokeswoman Sue Olafson.
