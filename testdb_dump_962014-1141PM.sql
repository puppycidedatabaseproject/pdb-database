He was standing in the driveway talking to another friend when Redwood City “Task Force” drove by the house.  They took notice of the men talking and recognized one of them.  They made a U-turn and got out of their vehicle with a very aggressive approach which startled him.  Since the Task Force drive around in an unmarked car the gentleman was confused and wasn’t sure who was approaching as such, so he fled down the driveway to the back gated yard in which our dogs are keep safely.  The police ran after him and entered the yard.  I heard the commotion and quickly ran out my room.  I heard my dog barking so I rushed to the back yard only to be stopped by the police. They had the man obtained as they were handcuffing him.  They would not let me through.  I saw my dog through the doorway and he was just staying in one place barking at the policeman across the yard from him.  At that moment I heard four gunshots.  My dog then fell to the ground.  I started screaming, I wanted to go see if he was alright.  They hurried me out to the other side of the fenced yard. He was out of my sight.  I was completely panicked and keep insisting for them to let me go to him.  Finally an officer came to me and yelled “your dog is dead!!”. They still would not let me see him.  They held me back with force.  It was at least 30 minutes before they finally let me see him, then they told my friend to take me away from the house.  When I was leaving they were also taking the man away (under arrest).  I yelled at him “they killed my dog!!!!”.  The police kept telling me the reason the dog was shot was because of that man.  They said that he had a warrant. A few days later, that man came to my house.  I didn’t want to see him, for I felt it was his fault, I was mad that he could come to my home with that pending situation of an out-standing warrant.  I felt that he brought the trouble to my home. \r\n\r\nI have found that the man had no warrant, in fact he wasn’t even on probation or parole.  He had a past history, but since has changed his lifestyle and has lived free of any criminal activity for several years.  The charges he received that day were “Trespassing” (on my property) and “Evading a police officer”.  He said that while he was at the station getting processed that the police man-handled him and told him that he should “move out of town”.  He had been harassed and actually arrested twice since this incident.\r\n\r\nI don’t understand this at all.  How can the police come on my property, chase an innocent man who was scared because of their approach, and shoot my dog from 22 feet away,  not once, but four times?  They didn’t even let anyone have a chance to put him away. All “Buddy” was doing was protecting our home.  The policeman said that he had to hold a lawn chair up to keep him from getting to him.  The lawn chair he was speaking about is made of solid wood.  It is too big and heavy, even for a strong man to hold with one arm and manage a loaded gun.  When in fact the lawn chair never was moved.  The imprints in the lawn were still under the legs of the chair.  The pillow that sits on the chair was also still sitting in place.  If he had picked up that chair the cushion would have fallen off. There is no way that with all the chaos going on could he have perfectly set that chair down in the exact same place as before.  The officer was right next to two huge redwood trees with enormous trunks.  He could have easily run for cover behind one of those trees.  Better yet he could have climbed over the fence without any problems.  There were many alternatives he could have done.  Buddy was not going after him.  My roommate was also right there.  She is a dog handler/trainer.  She has tons of experience handling dogs. She is also certified animal health technician, with knowledge of handling emergency situations with dogs.  She told the police this, and yet they still would not let her even go see if Buddy was still alive.  There was nobody there who checked to see if he had truly passed. This was just an assumption from an inexperienced police officer. A man that has no right to tell me anything in regards to my dog’s condition.  Buddy was rushed to the vet. His body was still warm. He passed when he was at the vet. He was shot through the spine, neck and abdomen. There was one casing that was never found.','http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:NsCvwI10zsgJ:redwoodcity-woodside.patch.com/blog_posts/police-shoot-and-kill-family-pet-059fc4f2+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us','Buddy','Unknown','No','No','Yes','Yes','Plain Clothes','No','Not Sure','Not Sure','Not Sure','Not Sure','Not Sure'),(4,'2012-12-06','California','Whittier','Pico Rivera Sheriffs',1,'On December 6, 2012, in the City of Pico Rivera, a Pet Pit Bull named Chico Blue was playing in his yard.

Owner is Brittany Preston. Owner\'s attorney is Chris Olson. Preston sued the city of St. Clair Shores, police officers David Jacquemain and Jeremy Moskwa, and animal control officer Tom Massey. The lawsuit alleges that in killing Lexie, the defendants violated Preston\'s Fourth Amendment rights and her civil rights. The events leading up to the shooting began in the early morning hours of Nov. 22 when Preston\'s grandfather, who reportedly suffers from dementia, accidentally left the dog outside. Authorities were called to the scene when the dog began to bark excessively. Much of what happened next was captured by dash cams on the responding police cruisers. Before even getting out of the car, an officer is heard saying The only thing Im gonna do is shoot it, anyway. I do not like dogs. Subsequent dash camera audio captured the officers discussing various methods of restraining the dog, at which point one of them can be heard saying, I don\'t do snares, I dont do dogs ... Ill shoot the fking thing. Authorities eventually make contact with Preston\'s grandfather. He initially states he does not know who the dog belongs to. Hey, here is what I\'m gonna tell you, if this isnt your dog, then you don\'t care if I shoot it because I\'m about to, an officer can be heard telling Preston\'s grandfather. Im very close to killing this dog, do you understand what Im telling you right now? I will kill this dog. So if this is your damn dog, bring it in the house. However, before Preston\'s grandfather could allow Lexie inside, the police officers shot at her four times, with three bullets making contact, according to police. Preston\'s grandfather can be heard on the dash cam audio confronting one of the police officers about the shooting. What the f--k, you shooting it right in front of me, he asked. The officer replied, It attacked us, sir, to which Preston\'s grandfather replied, I don\'t think so. You guys ought to go on TV. A short time later, an officer shot Lexie a fourth time. The dog can be heard crying out in pain again, but is still alive. The lawsuit alleges that when the animal control officer finally arrived on the scene, the officers can be heard on the dash cam video discussing with him how to deal with Lexie, who is still breathing despite her multiple wounds. Defendant police officers asked defendant Massey if he could choke it out, the lawsuit alleges. Another police officer suggested using a shovel to kill Lexie. Defendant Massey remarked that doing so would not be a good idea because, You know this s--t is going to be all over Facebook in about an hour, to which a police officer responded, yeah, unfortunately. The dash cam later captures Massey using a catch-pole to walk a badly wounded Lexie to the animal control truck. What happened next is also controversial, according to Olson. The lawsuit alleges a licensed veterinarian performed a gross necropsy on Lexie on Nov. 29. The findings allegedly contrast with the number of shots police say were fired at the scene. The necropsy, according to Olson, identified a total of 15 bullet holes in the dog. You do the math, he said. Evidently, based on the number of bullet holes, they shot Lexie several more times once she was taken away.','http://rt.com/usa/175372-officer-dog-shot-lawsuit/','Lexie','police officers David Jacquemain and Jeremy Moskwa animal control officer Tom Massey','Yes','No','No','Not Sure','Uniform','NA','NA','Yes','No','Yes','No'),(39,'2014-07-24','Georgia','Unincorporated DeKalb County','Dekalb County Police',1,'Tim Theall owner.

Holst of Sonny Boy Lane, whose 5-year-old German shepherd, Jake, was killed by a single shot after the deputy reported that the animal lunged at him. &quot;We called them because we didn&#039;t want to lose an animal and it turned into a catastrophe,&quot; Holst said. Family members contend that Jake was shot when he wasn&#039;t a threat, but was hunkered down holding his ground 10 feet away. The deputy reported that the dog, which weighed more than 80 pounds, was only two feet away from him, snarling, barking and about to strike. &quot;At approximately two feet, I had no choice but to discharge my service weapon to protect myself from being bitten by the K-9,&quot; Deputy Michael Buenting wrote in his incident report. &quot;The K-9 received one wound to the top of the head and immediately fell to the ground.&quot; A Sheriff&#039;s Office spokesman said all signs point to the deputy following proper protocol, firing in response to danger and when an attack became imminent. &quot;We didn&#039;t see where he did anything wrong,&quot; said sheriff&#039;s Maj. John Clark, who added that the investigation is ongoing and will include an internal-affairs examination of the shooting site. Clark also confirmed that Sheriff Al Cannon met with family members Tuesday to hear their concerns. The incident unfolded May 25 after Gretchen Holst called the Sheriff&#039;s Office for help. The family had been having an ongoing problem with a neighboring family allowing its dog to get inside of the Holsts&#039; electric fence. &quot;They were careful to inform the Sheriff&#039;s Department that their call was not an emergency,&quot; said Mike Gruenloh, the family&#039;s attorney. The primary concern was the family&#039;s two adult German shepherds -- Jake and Sasha -- and their recent litter, Gruenloh said. Buenting arrived about 20 minutes after the family called, Gruenloh said.\r\nAccording to Buenting&#039;s incident report, he drove into the driveway of the Holsts&#039; three-acre property, where he saw a man escorting three large dogs to the backyard. A woman later identified as the dogs&#039; owner, Gretchen Holst, was holding her hands up in the direction of the deputy. After the dogs were out of sight, Buenting reported, he got out of his cruiser and prepared to speak with Gretchen Holst. He then saw one of the large German shepherds running toward him &quot;viciously barking.&quot; &quot;Several times Holst yelled at the K-9 to stop as the responding deputy backed up toward his patrol vehicle,&quot; the report states. The deputy gave several &quot;stop&quot; commands, as well, but the dog came &quot;extremely close&quot; and continued to bark viciously, the deputy wrote. He drew his service weapon and repeated his halt commands.\r\nThe dog continued approaching, snarling aggressively, he wrote. That&#039;s when Buenting said he fired. The family&#039;s version, as relayed by Gruenloh, is that Gretchen Holst tried to signal Buenting to wait in his patrol car while her son was putting away the family pets so the family could talk to the deputy about the problem with the neighbor. &quot;Unfortunately, he continued to drive directly up to the family&#039;s house and exited his vehicle before the family had a chance to put Jake and Sasha safely in the back,&quot; Gruenloh said. Jake reportedly became startled by Buenting&#039;s cruiser radio, Gruenloh said, and circled back, barking at the deputy.\r\n&quot;While Mrs. Holst was moving forward to secure Jake, Deputy Buenting drew his pistol and fired a single shot into the head of the family&#039;s pet, killing it,&quot; Gruenloh&#039;s account said. &quot;It was just a senseless, unnecessary use of force,&quot; Gretchen Holst said. &quot;It cost us something very dear to us. Jake&#039;s not there to greet us in the driveway every day. And I was within 18 inches of the officer when he fired the shot.&quot; Her husband said he thinks the deputy panicked and used poor judgment.\r\nGruenloh took issue with the deputy&#039;s version of the shooting. He said witnesses reported that the dog was as much as 10 feet away when it was shot. &quot;Jake was hunkered down on his back legs, holding his ground and doing exactly what he was supposed to do, barking at a stranger,&quot; Gruenloh said.\r\nAn autopsy performed by the family&#039;s veterinarian found that Jake was shot in the top of the head, Gruenloh said. &quot;Had the dog been advancing on the officer it is more likely that its head would have been up in an attacking position rather than down.&quot; Buenting remains on duty after the shooting, and that is one of several points Gruenloh said the family wants addressed by the Sheriff&#039;s Office. They also want deputies to be better trained on how to respond to animal issues, and they want compensation for their loss.v&quot;I think the officer used very poor judgment,&quot; E.L.

Police were called Saturday morning to the 700 block of South Grundy Street in southeast Baltimore for a report of a stray dog that had nipped someone trying to rescue it. Sarah Gossard told 11 News that her beloved 7-year-old shar-pei named Nala had somehow escaped the gate of her back yard that morning. While she searched for the dog, including posting pictures of Nala on a community Facebook page, nearby resident Sandy Fleischer said she found Nala a few blocks away looking confused and thirsty. &ldquo;The dog was more scared of not knowing where it was and being thirsty and disoriented. The dog bit me out of fear because I tried to touch it, which was my fault,&rdquo; Fleischer told 11 News reporter Kai Reed. Police were called, and Fleischer said she watched as several officers used sticks to try to contain Nala, who she said wasn&rsquo;t being aggressive. &ldquo;You could hear the dog screaming and crying in pain,&rdquo; Fleischer said. &ldquo;I did see one officer that had been extremely aggressive that did have his knee into her chest that was tightening the noose. It seemed (they were doing it) relentlessly and unnecessarily.&rdquo; Fleischer then went into an ambulance, so she didn&rsquo;t see what happened next. Police said the officers then secured Nala using a dog pole, and an officer assigned to the emergency services division, later identified as Officer Jeffrey Bolger, went much further. &ldquo;Unfortunately, at some point after the dog was contained, one of our officers used a knife and cut the dog&rsquo;s throat. This is outrageous and an unacceptable breach of our protocol,&rdquo; Baltimore Police Deputy Commissioner Dean Palmere said. &ldquo;We have no words to describe this. To say that we are appalled at the allegations, I think, is an understatement,&rdquo; said Baltimore Police Deputy Commissioner Jerry Rodriguez. Commanders said they know of no reason for Bolger to use such force on a dog that was under control. Nala later died. &ldquo;She was just the sweetest dog and would never hurt anyone. She was just scared that day, and through all of those events &mdash; being scared and lost, thirsty, hungry &mdash; yes I&rsquo;m very sure that she bit someone, but the actions after that were not OK,&rdquo; Gossard said. She told 11 News she didn&rsquo;t find out until Wednesday that her dog was killed in such a violent way. &ldquo;This dog had a collar around its neck with tags, with my phone number. It&rsquo;s not OK,&rdquo; Gossard said. Bolger, who was also charged with malfeasance in office, has been suspended without pay. He was released early Thursday on his own personal recognizance, 11 News learned Obviously, my anger is toward this police officer. I don&rsquo;t want him to have his job. I don&rsquo;t want him to be able to go out on calls and react like that to a person, to a dog, to anything. That&rsquo;s not OK,&rdquo; Gossard said. Police are also investigating whether other officers who knew of the incident followed procedure to report it. Commanders said they &ldquo;caught wind of it Monday,&rdquo; two days later.

Leon Cordell Rosby, a 52-year-old man from Hawthorne, Calif., was walking his dog &ldquo;Max&rdquo; while watching a police response to a robbery on June 30. The California man was videotaping the showdown with his cell phone. Police accused him of disturbing the crime scene, and a video of the incident quickly went viral, garnering millions of views. As three officers approached him, Rosby put his Rottweiler in his car and allowed the police to apprehend him. But while he was being arrested, the dog jumped from an open car window, ran toward the officers and barked at them. One policeman shot the dog four times, causing the writhing Rottweiler to slowly bleed to death on the street. Rosby&rsquo;s knees buckled as he cried out for the dying animal. The incident outraged animal lovers and animal rights activists across the country, and the Hawthorne Police Department received letters of condemnation and death threats. In response, the police department released a second video of the incident, which showed more of the officer&rsquo;s actions before he shot the dog. More of Rosby&rsquo;s taunts to police could also be heard in the clip. After the release of that video, Rosby allegedly went to the home of the witness who recorded it and &ldquo;verbally confronted&rdquo; her and her son, police told KTLA. Now, Rosby is facing additional charges for his reaction, and is being held until his court date. Despite the public outcry against the actions of the officers, Rosby was on Tuesday charged with two counts of intimidating a witness, two counts of dissuading a witness from prosecuting a crime, and two counts of making criminal threats &ndash; all six of which are felonies. He was also charged with one misdemeanor count of resisting arrest. Mark Geragos, the attorney representing Rosby, told KTLA that police are trying to cover up the fact that they killed the Rottweiler by instead focusing on the wrongdoings of the defendant. &ldquo;The videos have shown that these cops killed this dog for absolutely no reason,&rdquo; Geragos said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s precisely why the cops now are scrambling to try to get him convicted, get him into custody and do anything else in order to try and turn the spotlight away from their actions.&rdquo; Rosby has sued the city of Hawthorne for the killing.

MacRoberts said it is standard procedure for the department to conduct an internal investigation of complaints regarding uses of force in any police matter. That investigation will look at whether police operated according to department standards. Christian Yepez and his family met with police Friday afternoon to discuss the matter, but MacRoberts said he could not share what was said because it relates to personnel matters. Yepez&#039;s mother, Pennie Yepez, said about 11 people went to the police station Friday afternoon to ask police why the family dog was killed. She said police did not offer much insight as to what happened to lead to the dog&#039;s death and family members left frustrated that their concerns were not being heard. MacRoberts said police entered the home to execute a search warrant as part of an investigation involving Yepez. He said the dog was shot after police entered, but it remained unclear what prompted police to fire on 5-year-old Nastradamus, a medium-sized mixed breed. &quot;Details beyond that are part of the internal investigation and not being released,&quot; MacRoberts said. Yepez was arrested after the raid and charged with misdemeanor possession of marijuana, possession of drug paraphernalia and maintaining a dwelling for controlled substances. MacRoberts said police seized less than 1.5 ounces of marijuana and two guns from the home. Pennie Yepez said she was not home during the raid.

The report stated the dog bit the other officer&rsquo;s foot, while he yelled for the woman to get her dog, but the dog continued and ignored &ldquo;any verbal or physical attempts of the complaint to restrain it,&rdquo; according to the report. The officer tried to draw his gun, but was unable to do so because the woman &ldquo;pushed down on his holster,&rdquo; according to the report.

Officials from Trident and the town of East Millinocket didn&#039;t immediately return telephone messages seeking comment on Monday. The shooting occurred Aug. 9 at Bishop&#039;s home, when Officer Anthony Redmond came to his house in response to a hit-and-run accident at Bangor Savings Bank on Aug. 9. East Millinocket Police Chief Cameron McDunnah said that the dog was charging at Redmond when Redmond fired one shot. He described Redmond as an experienced officer who responded appropriately and only fired after repeatedly yelling to Bishop to call off his dog. Bishop contested this account, saying the dog went through the door with him and that he did not hear Redmond say anything to him except to ask, &quot;Are you Frank?&quot; Jake is healing well, Bishop said. &quot;He&#039;s sleeping a lot but acting like nothing happened to him.

The incident was witnessed by numerous bystanders, some of whom questioned the lethal tactics taken by police. The animal barked and growled when approached but attacked no one, they said. &quot;To me &mdash; I felt like it was scared more than anything,&quot; said Randy Schamber, an employee of the Hager Parking Lot where the incident occurred around 4:30 p.m.\r\n&quot;I feel like (police) could&#039;ve done more to catch the dog. I don&#039;t understand why they had to shoot it.&quot; Police, however, said the animal was shot only after all other efforts had failed. Officers tried placing a snare around the dog&#039;s neck and attempted to subdue the animal with a Taser. Both efforts failed and only seemed to make the animal more agitated, Sgt. Bill Hickey said Wednesday night.\r\n&quot;In that moment, the officer felt he wasn&#039;t able to control the situation and believed the dog to be a danger,&quot; Hickey added. He declined to release the name of the officer, stating that an internal review will be conducted to determine if the use of force was justified. Hickey said police responded to the West King Street lot for a report of a loose dog that had chased people and another dog.\r\nWitnesses said the animal didn&#039;t go after anyone. They said the white pit bull had jumped from the partially-covered bed of a pickup truck that was parked in the lot. Schamber said the animal and another dog, which one witness said appeared to be a spaniel-type, had been in the back of the truck for at least a half-hour. He said the animals got his attention because the white dog would bark when people walked by the vehicle. After jumping from the truck, the pit bull ran toward a man who had just gotten out of an SUV with his dog. The pit bull ran up to the man&#039;s dog but didn&#039;t attack the animal, Schamber said. The man, who lives nearby, scooped up his medium-sized dog and placed it back in his vehicle, inside a dog crate. The pit bull then jumped in the back of the SUV as well.\r\n&quot;Not necessarily at (my dog), just jumped in the car &mdash; but if you tried to get close to him he&#039;d growl. But I think by this time the dog is really confused,&quot; the resident, who asked that his name not be used, said. &quot;We tried to get him out of the car,&quot; said Schamber. &quot;I keep dog treats in the booth so I ran over and got some to try to coax him out.&quot; The dog jumped from the vehicle, only to bark and growl at the men.\r\nThat&#039;s when Schamber called police.\r\n&quot;The Fulton (Theater) was letting out and there were elderly people walking through the lot. (The dog) hadn&#039;t gone after anyone but I didn&#039;t want to risk the possibility,&quot; he said. For the next several minutes, until police arrived, the animal went back and forth from his owner&#039;s truck to the resident&#039;s SUV.\r\n&quot;He couldn&#039;t get back in his own truck but it seemed like he wanted to,&quot; Schamber said. &quot;He would keep walking over and looking up. Then he&#039;d go over and jump in the back of the other car again.&quot; The dog was in the back of the resident&#039;s SUV when police arrived.\r\n&quot;He&#039;s not scowling or growling but this one cop has a rifle and he&#039;s threatening to shoot that white dog next to (the resident&#039;s) dog in the back of the car,&quot; according to Meredith Wilterdink, who works at the nearby Carr&#039;s Restaurant.\r\nThe resident refused to allow the officer to fire, refusing the officer&#039;s command to move away from the car, Wilterdink said. Police eventually placed the resident in handcuffs but he later was released with no charges filed. The pit bull eventually jumped from the SUV at which time police unsuccessfully tried to subdue the animal with a Taser. Moments later, according to Schamber, a shot rang out.\r\n&quot;The dog was running around yelping, and then a second shot,&quot; Schamber said as his eyes welled with tears. &quot;I don&#039;t understand why they had to shoot him; he didn&#039;t hurt anybody.&quot; &quot;He didn&#039;t need to be shot,&quot; the resident said adamantly. &quot;What he needed was to be tethered and maybe tranquilized. But shot ... no.&quot;\r\nRegarding the use of a tranquilizer gun, Hickey said he wasn&#039;t sure if city police still had one. &quot;In the past I believe we did. That said, it&#039;s something that&#039;s kept under lock and key. It&#039;s not something you grab and go in the heat of the moment.&quot; He also said the department&#039;s dog law officer, who typically would&#039;ve responded to Wednesday&#039;s incident, had gone off duty about 30 minutes prior to the incident. &quot;There were a lot of factors here &mdash; rush hour in downtown, a busy street, a public parking lot &mdash; that made for an unfortunate outcome,&quot; Hickey said. &quot;We&#039;re dog owners too and nobody takes this sort of thing lightly. &quot;Yes, shooting the animal is an option but it&#039;s not the one any of us prefer.

Russ Boring with the Springfield Police Department said officers received a 911 call from a resident near 41st and Camellia in Springfield around 6:15 p.m. The caller reported a pit bull acting aggressively in the neighborhood and running around the street unleashed. Boring said the caller told police that the pit bull was acting in a threatening manner towards a young boy. &quot;It was aggressive enough to where there was a gentleman driving down the street who was honking his horn on his car, who placed his car between the dog and the boy, and ended up having the boy get in his car and drove him away from the scene,&quot; Boring said. An officer responded to the scene. According to Boring, the officer tried to coax the dog back into the home where it came from. At first the dog was friendly, Boring said, but then it became more aggressive as the officer tried to get it back on the property. Boring said the pit bull &quot;growled, it snarled, it showed it&#039;s teeth and it became pretty aggressive.&quot; As the dog approached the officer, Boring said the officer believed he was in danger. &quot;He had to make a decision right there,&quot; he said. &quot;I don&#039;t think a Taser would have been effective with this aggressive behavior and this dog.

The veterinarian who treated Kiki called where the bullet lodged &quot;somewhat of a miracle for this dog.&quot; Kiki didn&#039;t have a heavy active hemmorage and was discharged as stable patient who had received treatment, said Dr. Meg Schneck with the Emergency Veterinary Hospital.\r\nThe hospital donated services for treatment of the dog prior to discharge on Tuesday, she said. Schneck explained that she wouldn&#039;t propose surgery to remove the bullet. She said her &quot;recommendation is to leave it alone.&quot;\r\nTo remove the bullet, Schneck said a vet would have to use a bone saw and cut into fragile structures in the dog&#039;s head.

He and a friend started a Facebook page and an online petition calling for an investigation of the shooting. &ldquo;I hope we get justice. Cause I do not think it&#039;s right.&rdquo; Police didn&#039;t want to talk about the issue on camera, but according to their report, here&#039;s what happened. On the afternoon of August 21st an East Peoria officer responded to a call of two dogs running loose in the Quail Trail area. The officer found two people- one limping and one bleeding from the leg- saying they were bit by a dog. He was told both dogs belong to Ellis so he parked outside the owner&#039;s home and waited for animal control. The two pit bulls returned as he was questioning one of the bite victims. They circled the officer before heading towards Ellis&#039;s home. That&#039;s when a neighbor, two doors up the road, walked out of his house and headed towards his car. The Police Report says one of the dogs, Bella, started walking toward the neighbor. After the officer yelled at the neighbor to &quot;watch out&quot; the dog turned toward the officer, growled and started running at him. Bella got less than 10-yards from the officer when he fired those fatal shots. &ldquo;They just got a call and seen my dog and thought it was it.&rdquo; Ellis believes another neighbor&rsquo;s pit bull was responsible for attacking two people, not his dog. &ldquo;I think it was a mistaken identity.&rdquo; But according to police reports, witnesses recognized Bella by a large tumor on her backside. Ellis tells us he secures his dogs behind a chain linked fence. &ldquo;They do occasionally get out, but most generally I guess they&rsquo;re put up,&quot; says another neighbor.And whether it was Bella biting people or not, one neighbor just asks one thing\r\n&ldquo;To see my neighborhood safe. Whether it be from people or animals&rdquo; Ellis says he would also like Bella&rsquo;s remains returned. We spoke to the Tazewell County Animal control.They say they are inspecting Bella for rabies and it&rsquo;s their standard procedure to not return the dog when that happens.The Police Report indicates that Ellis was cooperative with the officer after the incident.

James Clark says he plans to file a formal complaint against the two police officers who were captured on video using force on his two barking dogs. Clark told the station he wasn&#039;t home when one of his Labrador retrievers, Max, got out of his yard and was reported to be chasing children at a nearby school. When officers arrived, a neighbor captured one of them on video shooting Max with a bean bag. &quot;My heart broke. My heart still breaks every time I hear him whimper,&quot; Clark said. &quot;You know, it&#039;s like my son here falling and getting hurt.&quot; Police say the video only tells part of the story. &quot;The officers acted very appropriately. They kept that dog from hurting them,&quot; West Covina police Lt. Ken Plunkett said, according to the station. Because the camera is so shaky, only the audio of the bean-bag shot going off can be heard, he said. The video viewer does not show the moments leading up to it. &quot;At that point, that&#039;s when the dog became aggressive and charged at him,&quot; Lt. Plunkett said. Witnesses, however, say the dogs were not being as aggressive as police claim. &quot;He was barking but not like all dramatic,&quot; witness Anna Estrada said, according to the station. &quot; &#039;Ruff, ruff.&#039; Like a dog would bark. It was a normal bark...I think the cop was being more dramatic, calling more attention on himself.&quot; After Max was shot with the bean bag, police say the officers tried to get him back in the yard, where his sister Chloe was barking behind the fence. The video also shows one of the officers using a fire extinguisher on Chloe. While watching the video, the dog owner, Clark points out where the officers use the fire extinguisher. &quot;He sprays her. And now the officers, they can&#039;t breathe themselves,&quot; he said.\r\nAgain, police disagree. &quot;The nozzle wasn&#039;t pointed at the dog and directly shot...in the face,&quot; Lt.

It was a normal day, she said, which involved watching her 5-year-old daughter play behind the house with their dog, as her infant son lied in a playpen inside the house. Ms. Shimburski&rsquo;s parents, John Shimburski and Martha Spaulding, were not at home when the day turned to chaos. At around 2:00 p.m., Ms. Shimburski recalled that she ducked inside the house for a moment to use the restroom. She became alerted to something occurring when the family&rsquo;s two dogs began barking; one was inside and one was outside the house. Ms. Shimburski said that she looked out the window and saw two vehicles parked outside &mdash; a car and an SUV &mdash; along with unidentified men, one of whom had a gun drawn. Panicked, she rushed outside toward danger to attend to her daughter, Makenna, who was accompanied by &ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; a 2-year-old Brindle Pit Bull. The Shimburski family&#039;s &quot;big baby,&quot; called Lady. (Source: Megan Shimburski) The Shimburski family&rsquo;s &ldquo;big baby,&rdquo; called Lady. (Source: Megan Shimburski)\r\n&ldquo;I heard 2 shots fired, and Lady yelp, and my daughter scream,&rdquo; Ms. Shimburski told Police State USA. The armed stranger had just shot the family&rsquo;s beloved pet in the head, with Makenna standing &ldquo;20 feet behind [the dog] in the exact same direction.&rdquo; &ldquo;He then proceeded to continue walking up the hill with his gun raised, and I screamed at him not to shoot his gun again,&rdquo; she added. Ms. Shimburski says that there was no clear indication of who the intruders were; there were no markings on the vehicles and the three men were not in uniforms. She described them as dressed in &ldquo;business attire&rdquo; &mdash; definitely not uniforms. &ldquo;I stated that I was going to call the police, and that&rsquo;s when they said, &lsquo;We are the Erie County Police,&rsquo;&rdquo; Ms. Shimburski recalled. The men began then began to request to enter her parents&rsquo; home. Ms. Shimburski declined, and tended to her children and dogs. Lady was bleeding profusely. Makenna was cowering nearby crying, &ldquo;The man shot Lady. He shot my dog.&rdquo; As Ms. Shimburski took her daughter inside, she discovered that two of the self-described &ldquo;officers&rdquo; had already entered her parents&rsquo; home, after she had explicitly told them to stay out. &ldquo;They were yelling at me to tell my daughter it was OK,&rdquo; she said. The young mom secured her daughter in a bedroom along with the second dog that had been indoors. Her parents quickly arrived after being notified about what had happened. The reason for the intrusion was finally made known when they announced that they were looking for the father of Ms. Shimburski&rsquo;s son. The family told the officers that the man they were seeking had never lived there, didn&rsquo;t receive mail at the address, and that they should have tried looking for him at his own home. The police had not brought a warrant, and said they only wanted to ask the man some questions. They continued to request a search of the home. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to GRAZE her.&rdquo;\r\nMeanwhile Lady, described as a &ldquo;67-pound big baby,&rdquo; was hiding under the deck, covered in blood. A bullet had traveled through the tissue on her head, neck, and shoulder. A large, open gash allowed blood to pour down her face into her eyes and nose. It was a shocking sight for the family. &ldquo;The officer stated that he had just &lsquo;grazed&rsquo; her, and that she would be fine,&rdquo; Ms. Shimburski recalled. &ldquo;I looked at him and said, &lsquo;You did not graze her!!&rsquo; His words were, &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to GRAZE her.&rsquo;&rdquo; The shooter &mdash; [later identified as Erie County Sheriff&#039;s Detective Greg McCarthy] &mdash; claimed he shot in self-defense because the dog was &ldquo;charging and barking.&rdquo; Ms. Shimburski says that he exaggerated the dog&rsquo;s actions and the distance he was standing from her when he fired.  No one was bitten or in danger, she said, and the dog was coming from the back to the front of the house to investigate the strange visitors. &ldquo;My child could have been shot,&rdquo; Ms. Shimburski said to Police State USA. &ldquo;She now has the idea that these people who were there to protect people are bad people,&rdquo; and added that she may need counseling. &ldquo;I stated that not all cops are bad but at this point I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s going to trust them.&rdquo; Lady ultimately survived, after an emergency surgery, 60 metal stitches, and $1,200.00 in veterinarian bills. &ldquo;The police did not leave names or numbers, nor did they show any remorse,&rdquo; Ms. Shimburski said. In fact, she had been left with no paperwork; no business card; no record whatsoever of what had happened. Regardless, the family attempted to get past the incident.  Young Makenna dealt with confused feelings about the shooting and Lady slowly recovered from her injuries at home.  Ms. Shimburski did not even have a confirmed phone number to call regarding the incident.  Until 11 days later&hellip; A &ldquo;Dangerous Animal&rdquo;\r\nThe family found that their troubles were not yet over on August 5th, when police returned for another visit.  This time, they brought paperwork: a document that read &ldquo;Order to Seize Dog.&rdquo; The Erie County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office, unsatisfied that Lady had survived the first encounter, had sought out another legal method of killing her.  Describing Lady as &ldquo;dangerous dog &mdash; pit bull,&rdquo; the document authorized deputies to &ldquo;seize the said dog harbored by the said Megan Shimburski&rdquo; and to &ldquo;hold, care for, or dispose of&rdquo; Lady, pursuant to New York&rsquo;s Agriculture and Markets Law, Article 7, Section 123. The deputy and an animal control officer took Lady away to the animal warden, leaving her with an uncertain fate.  Pending a court date on August 12th, Lady may be euthanized if found to be a &ldquo;dangerous dog.&rdquo; The document was signed by Gene R. Heintz, Justice of the Town of Sardina.  It also confirms that the men at the property on July 25th were Erie County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office detectives Graham, Noecher, and McCarthy.  The man who shot Lady was Detective Greg McCarthy. &ldquo;I am outraged and disgusted by their behavior,&rdquo; Ms. Shimburski said in an interview.  &ldquo;They put my child&rsquo;s life in danger because of their negligence.

The men were on their way to visit friends in Lake Charles. They climbed into the back of a parked box truck in the near-empty parking lot of the Southwest Daily News to take shelter, Carpenter said. Before long, a police car pulled up and an officer, gun drawn, ordered them out of the truck. The officer, Brian Thierbach of the Sulphur Police Department, spotted Arzy and told the men to &quot;get your dog,&quot; according to Carpenter. He said the officer watched him tie Arzy to a nearby fence with a 3 1/2-foot leash before Thierbach handcuffed both men, ordered them to the ground facing away from Arzy, and asked, &quot;Is this dog going to bite me or attack me?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; Carpenter said he responded. &quot;He is an incredibly friendly dog.&quot; Twenty seconds later, Carpenter told HuffPost, he heard a single shot.

Midkiff &quot;took off&quot; and headed to the office, and by the time he arrived, &quot;the officer already had Brandon and the other guy on the ground.&quot; Midkiff, 33, told HuffPost he stayed about 20 feet from the men, and heard Thierbach asking if the dog was going to attack. Midkiff said Thierbach was standing on the bumper of the box truck petting Arzy. &quot;The dog was rubbing up against the cop,&quot; Midkiff said. &quot;He would rub the dog&#039;s back and then push him away. All of a sudden, he just jumped down and shot the dog in the head.&quot; Midkiff said he could see both Thierbach and the dog clearly. &quot;That dog did not bite that officer,&quot; he said. &quot;The dog was wagging his tail, his tongue was hanging out.&quot; Carpenter said he spun around when he heard the gunshot. &quot;I see my dog kind of start shaking and batting at his head,&quot; he said. &quot;I saw the blood start to run down his face. &hellip; I&#039;m watching my dog die while I&#039;m sitting in cuffs.&quot; Thierbach, Carpenter told HuffPost, &quot;seemed to be fighting back a smile.&quot; He said he asked the cop why he was smiling, and that Thierbach &quot;smirked&quot; and replied, &quot;Well, he nipped at my foot.&quot; Backup officers put Arzy&#039;s body in a trash bag and threw it into the back of a vehicle, Carpenter said.

In May one of the Walkers&rsquo; other dogs had bitten a 16-year-old boy who lived in the complaining party&rsquo;s residence. Upon leaving the Walker&rsquo;s home, the investigating deputy, John Vaught, shot and killed a charging dog, an Australian Shepherd named Blue, at the Walker&rsquo;s residence in the front yard. &ldquo;This was an unfortunate incident, and I want to publicly express my sympathy and condolences to the dog&rsquo;s owners, Ryan and Toni Walker, as I know they considered Blue to be a member of their family,&rdquo; Richardson said. &ldquo;After reviewing the discharge of a firearm report, I have decided to change our policy regarding canine encounters. The new policy will be in effect after review by legal counsel. It will outline some specific actions and strategies that should help officers avoid using deadly force against canines.&rdquo;\r\nBecause deputies frequently come into contact with dogs each day, from making traffic stops, serving warrants and conducting interviews, Jim Osorio of Canine Encounters Law Enforcement Training of Arlington will conduct a training Oct. 13-14 at the Randall County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office. Osorio&rsquo;s program includes factors contributing to a dog bite, types of aggressive dogs, dog body language, encountering dogs on the job, report writing, use of force continuum, tools of the trade and self-defense against dogs. &ldquo;This training will give officers option and strategies in dealing with aggressive and dangerous dogs and the tools on how to best deescalate these situations,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It will also provide our officers with knowledge and tactics so they can better protect themselves, the citizens we serve and the dogs that officers encounter.&rdquo; Richardson said that the Facebook page &ldquo;Justice for Blue&rdquo; contains false statements regarding the incident. Because of those statements, Richardson showed the dash camera video from the incident to press during the conference. &ldquo;Specific statements indicating that the dog was &lsquo;shot just for barking&rsquo; and that a &lsquo;child was endangered&rsquo; by the shots that were fired, are both inaccurate,&rdquo; Richardson said. When Vaught arrived at the complainant&rsquo;s house, the dogs were no longer there, according to a copy of the incident report provided by the Randall County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office. The deputy then went to the Walkers&rsquo; home, and when he attempted to exit the vehicle two dogs appeared with one charging aggressively, according to the report. Vaught reported that he used pepper spray to protect himself, but it &ldquo;had little effect on the dog.&rdquo; He wrote that once he made contact with Toni Walker, the two dogs &ldquo;became very friendly.&rdquo; The law states that dogs can run unconfined and without leashes if the owners provide a plot of land of at least 5 acres. The Walkers&rsquo; property meets that requirement, but a violation still occurs if the dogs leave the property, Richardson said. The video shows the officer coming out the home, veer out the frame to avoid going near the dog, which was under a parked vehicle. The dog runs toward the officer, which is when shots were fired. However, the officer using his firearm cannot be seen in the video. Richardson said the officer fired five times and shot the dog twice. Toni Walker then comes out of the home holding a small child. Richardson said the dog was still alive, but Walker asked the officer to shoot Blue once more to humanely kill the animal.\r\n&ldquo;The next inaccuracy on the Facebook page is that I provided an &lsquo;edited&rsquo; version of the dash camera footage to the Walkers. Be design the dash camera footage cannot be edited, or it would be of no evidentiary value,&rdquo; Richardson said.\r\nIn the video Toni Walker can be heard apologizing for being extremely upset, to which the officer replies that he understands. Before leaving the scene, Vaught can be heard asking Walker if she would like him to move the dog. She responded that she wanted to move him, and then asked Vaught to hold her 7-month-old son. Walker can then be seen picking up the dog and carrying it behind the home while Vaught follows her with the baby. Vaught then provided Walker with a card for the sheriff&rsquo;s office should she need anything or have other concerns. &ldquo;The question isn&rsquo;t whether or not this was a justified use of force; the question is &lsquo;was it avoidable.&rsquo; My answer to that question is yes,&rdquo; Richardson said. Richardson said he was saddened by the incident, especially witnessing on the video a very upset Toni Walker carry Blue behind the house. He also said that he offered to buy the Walkers&rsquo; a new dog, but was told their other dog was pregnant with puppies fathered by Blue. Richardson said he went to the Walkers&rsquo; home and gave Toni Walker a $500 check to cover veterinary expenses. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been pretty blasted over that, but I did it out of the goodness of my heart,&rdquo; Richardson said. The Walkers have stated they have no intention on cashing the check, but are looking into acquiring legal counsel.','http://www.myplainview.com/canyon/c_top_stories/article_14e54b22-2245-11e4-84ae-001a4bcf887a.html','Blue','John Vaught','No','No','No','Not Sure','Uniform','Yes','Not Sure','No','No','Not \r\nSure','No'),(146,'2014-07-27','Missouri','Columbia','Howard County Sheriff Department',1,'Victim King pitbull mix, shot with a 12 gauge shotgun.

Owner 73-year-old Patty Wynston (as of 2014). A Howard County police officer shot and fatally wounded a pit bull in late February, upsetting the dog&#039;s owner, who said the shooting was not necessary.\r\nHoward County police, however, say the dog not only approached an officer aggressively, but charged toward him as well. &quot;I&#039;m a nervous wreck,&quot; said the dog&#039;s owner, Patty Wynston, a 71-year-old who lives in the 9200 block of Whiskey Bottom Road. &quot;She was my dog. She slept with me every night.&quot; Police were called Feb. 26 to Whiskey Bottom Road for reports of two pit bulls running loose. When they got to the owner&#039;s home, the dogs were inside, according to police spokeswoman Sherry Llewellyn. Wynston said the pit bulls, an 8-year-old named Yayo and Yayo&#039;s daughter, 3-year-old Pebbles, had accidentally gotten out earlier. She said police asked Wynston to leash the dogs and bring them out, but she didn&#039;t have enough time to do so before officers again knocked on her door &quot;The doors went open,&quot; Wynston said, &quot;and of course the dogs went out.&quot; Police said that an officer was approaching the home when one of the dogs charged out of the house toward the officer, barking aggressively. &quot;The officer backed away from the dog, which continued to charge and gain speed,&quot; Llewellyn said. &quot;When the dog was approximately three feet from the officer, he drew his weapon and fired at the dog, wounding it.&quot; That pit bull was Yayo, who later had to be euthanized. Wynston said Yayo &quot;was walking toward the officer, but she was not aggressive or nothing until he pulled his gun.&quot; The dog, she said, &quot;wasn&#039;t an aggressive dog, but when people came in our yard, even if she knew them, she&#039;d bark.&quot; Police said their records show neither dog as being licensed or vaccinated, and that Yayo&#039;s license had been revoked in Howard County in 2008. The dog was sent to New York to live with a family member, and there was no record of her having been re-licensed in the county, Llewellyn said. Police policy allows officers to fire their weapons at an animal if doing so will prevent the officer or another person from substantial harm, or if an animal is so badly injured that shooting it will keep it from suffering any further, Llewellyn said. Wynston&#039;s other dog was allowed to stay at the home, as officers did not see them running loose, Llewellyn said. A citation was issued for failure to license and vaccinate the dog. Wynston says Yayo has been cremated and her ashes are now on the mantle. &quot;I was very attached to her,&quot; she said.','http://www.baltimoresun.com/explore/howard/news/crime/ph-ho-cf-dog-shooting-0315-20120313,0,5655392.story','Yayo','Unknown','Not \r\nSure','No','No','Not Sure','Uniform','NA','Not Sure','No','No','Not \r\nSure','No'),(148,'2014-07-23','Texas','Cedar Park','Cedar Park Police Department',1,'Victim is repeatedly reported as a pitbull or pitbull mix following statements by police.

She was inside the house when one of her sons told her police were pulling up the driveway. She said by the time she reached the front door, she heard two shots fired. She said she was immediately worried about her children playing outside. Then she realized one of her family&#039;s dogs had been shot by officers. &quot;I tried to gather the kids up to put them in the house because apparently you&#039;re not safe outside with officers where we should be because they&#039;re protecting and serve,&quot; Best said. &quot;If you show up with a gun and you&#039;re irate, then you&#039;re not protecting me so I did not feel safe.&quot; Within moments, she found out why police were at her house. They were investigating a cell phone stolen from T.L. Hanna High School. The report was initiated by the school&#039;s resource officer, who is an Anderson County deputy.\r\nThe phone had been tracked by GPS to Best&#039;s house and was being carried by a friend of her son&#039;s, who told her he had found it at school. The school resource officer called for back-up from Anderson police because the East Franklin Street is in the city. A spokesman for the Anderson County Sheriff&#039;s Office said the resource officer was not on scene yet when the dog was shot. FOX Carolina called the Anderson Police Department, who provided an incident report of the dog shooting. It was written by Officer Joseph Chapman. Part of the report said, &quot;A brown and white large dog charged myself and Captain Aman. Officers did draw duty issue weapons and felt in fear that the dog was going to attack, due to the threatening manner it was coming at officers. Captain Aman did shoot the dog with one shot, at which time the dog went into some bushes and was not a threat.&quot; But the family gave a different story, calling their dog a gentle giant. Adrian Gaines, one of Best&#039;s sons, was in the driveway when he saw officers arrive and witnessed the shooting. &quot;The dog didn&#039;t bark, show any teeth, it didn&#039;t rush them, didn&#039;t growl or anything,&quot; Gaines said. &quot;Once he shot him the first time, I&#039;m sure he was scared and that&#039;s how he got up in the bushes and he ran up in the bushes and that&#039;s when you shoot him again.

Thursday afternoon Raccoon was found dead of a gunshot wound between her eyes in the woods about 150 yards from Mike, Christy and Zaley Packett&#039;s home off Valley View Drive in Forest City.

Another staff member at the Forest City Police Department learned from Mike the dog was missing. Mike had filed a report and also offered a reward for Raccoon&#039;s return. On Thursday afternoon the staff member put the case together and Mike was called to meet police officers in a wooded area near his house. Mike said he met them about 150 yards from his house. Raccoon was in a bag. \r\n&quot;I asked them if that was my dog. They told me he had been shot between the eyes,&quot; Mike said. &quot;Why would somebody shoot this kind gentle soul? There is no reason for this.&quot; &quot;He was an off duty officer, used his own personal weapon and said the dog was aggressive with him . . . he never came to us to tell us he had to shoot my dog,&quot; Mike said. Raccoon went missing at about 3 p.m. Wednesday after she and the family&#039;s other bulldog, Dufus, had been playing outdoors. Raccoon didn&#039;t return when she was called, Mike explained. He said that was very unusual so the search for her began. The dogs had just received a bath and Mike did not put their electronic collars on them because they were still wet. For the next 24 hours the dog was missing. Mike said he and others combed their neighborhood covering about 200 acres searching and calling for Raccoon. &quot;The worst part is we went right past them and never once did they tell us,&quot; Mike said of Brooks&#039; family. &quot;We spent a lot of time looking for our dog,&quot; Christy Packett said. Brooks was eventually fired and pled guilty to misdemeanor cruelty to animals and misdemeanor resisting a police officer. District Court Judge Laura Powell sentenced Brooks to 30 days in jail, suspended sentence, unsupervised probation for 12 months, 24 hours of community service within the next 30 days, cost of court and community service fees.

She&#039;s been known to roam her Irmo neighborhood from time to time. But her family says she&#039;s never gone far and never hurt anyone. &quot;She&#039;s probably gotten out about three or four times and usually a neighbor comes by [and says] &#039;Hey, your dog&#039;s in my yard,&#039; and we go get her,&quot; said Kenya&#039;s owner Jared Mann. &quot;It&#039;s never been a big deal.&quot; When her family returned to their Charring Cross Road home after Labor Day fun, Kenya was not there. &quot;We found a note on the front door saying that our dog has been shot by Irmo PD,&quot; said Mann. &quot;We found the blood right after we found the note in our front yard.&quot; Several neighbors say they heard gun shots. &quot;My husband and me were both talking to the police officers that were here,&quot; said the neighbor. &quot;And the one who shot the dog said that she had charged him. But we had seen that dog before in our backyard and she&#039;s never shown any aggression ever.&quot; Irmo Police say they received a call from a jogger who says Kenya chased this person down the street. When officers arrived, the dog was back on its property -- in the front yard, near the steps. Mann says they&#039;ve tried many different methods to restrain Kenya, including building a fence just for the dog and putting in an electrical fence as well. There&#039;s also a chair attached to the back steps, but somehow Kenya escaped. Police say when one of the officers tried to go to the front door to find the owners, the dog charged at him. The officer says he felt threatened by the dog&#039;s aggressive behavior so he fired two shots at the dog. &quot;He charged me,&quot; said the officer in the incident report. &quot;I had to shoot him.&quot; &quot;She was still moving 30 minutes later and I asked if I could take her to the vet and they said no,&quot; said a neighbor. &quot;And that&#039;s when one of the police officers asked the other police officer to get a tarp and just covered her up.&quot; Irmo Police deny that. The report goes on to say the officer fired a third and final shot to &quot;end the dog&#039;s misery.&quot; Family and neighbors do not understand why a gun had to be fired and why the officer killed Kenya. &quot;With the dog being that close to the house, if it was in the middle of the street, it&#039;d be a little bit different I think. But the dog was on its own property so I felt he could have left the dog alone,&quot; said a neighbor. In a statement provided by the jogger, he praises the officer&#039;s candor in regard to the incident. &quot;[He] seemed equally concerned about the dog as he was about the safety of the neighborhood. It was clear that he did not want anyone or the dog to get hurt. He seemed like a true professional in control of the situation,&quot; said the statement. Irmo Police Chief Brian Buck says the officer acted in self-defense. According to an Irmo ordinance, it is illegal for any domestic animal to run at large on the streets or in public places. When asked if the officer could have tasered the dog instead of shooting it, Buck said the officer used the weapon he thought would guarantee his safety.','http://www.wistv.com/story/23324440/irmo-family-unhappy-officer-shot-and-killed-their-dog','Kenya','Unknown','Yes','No','No','Not Sure','Uniform','NA','NA','No','No','Not \r\nSure','No'),(166,'2013-05-21','Nevada','Las Vegas','Las Vegas Police Department',1,'Shouting, &ldquo;Justice for Freckles,&rdquo; about a dozen people at the Regional Justice Center on Thursday protested canine killings by Las Vegas police officers. Led by Las Vegan Sarah Hecht, whose 45-pound Australian shepherd hybrid was run down by a two-ton police cruiser earlier this year, the protestors asked for better training for police officers dealing with animals. A police spokeswoman declined to comment on the case because there was an ongoing internal affairs investigation into the incident. The investigation is expected to take several more months. Hecht, 22, was overcome with emotion while speaking of her beloved pet who was a birthday present for getting straight As in high school. An officer told Hecht he purposefully ran over the dog after it had escaped her backyard and was heading toward children playing on May 21. Freckles was dragged by the police cruiser, but lived. Hecht rushed the canine to a veterinarian. The dog licked his owner during the trip. Once there, Hecht made the difficult decision to euthanize the animal. Hecht believes Freckles escaped her backyard after he was taunted by neighborhood children. She insisted her dog would never hurt anyone and had no history of biting humans. While she was at the veterinarian&rsquo;s office, Hecht&rsquo;s father was cited with having an unrestrained dog. Following the protest Thursday, Hecht wept before Las Vegas Justice of the Peace Karen Bennett-Haron as she explained what police had done to her dog and how she had no money left after paying $1,000 to try and save her &ldquo;son&rsquo;s&rdquo; life. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have children. He was my son,&rdquo; Hecht told the judge.\r\nBennett-Haron and prosecutors quickly agreed to dismiss the charges. She has been cited twice for animal code violations, including not obtaining a permit or sterilizing her dogs. Both matters were also dismissed, court records show.

Now, he wants police held responsible. &quot;Shocking,&quot; is how Wayne Meadows describes the way a Harrisonburg police officer killed a cat he rescued from the side of the road. He says the officer beat the cat to death with his night stick. &quot;I was a wreck at that point. I mean I was completely in shock. I didn&#039;t know what to do, I didn&#039;t know what to say,&quot; Wayne says. Wayne said he had to call police because local vets and animal services were closed since it was late at night on Friday, November 11th. He tried to comfort the cat until the officer arrived. They discussed what to do, and when the officer offered to put the cat out of its misery, using a night stick was the last thing Wayne expected. &quot;I went inside expecting a gun shot and then I heard it happening on my front porch. I heard at least 15-20 hits,&quot; Wayne says. The officer removed the body, but he had to clean the rest.\r\n&quot;It was nasty to say the least. I was sick to my stomach the whole time doing it. I tried to wash it off as best as I could,&quot; Wayne says. The officer told him to contact police because of damage to the house. There are stains and smashed siding around the porch. Wayne did contact police, but says they didn&#039;t get back to him. However, the department offered WHSV this statement saying they did receive the complaint.\r\n&quot;An internal investigation was conducted into this matter and appropriate action has been taken internally. In addition, the department continues to review the current procedures in handling animal complaints is to determine if any changes or modifications need to be made.&quot; Wayne says he was so shocked to act at the time, but hopes this never happens again. &quot;The only thing I wished I had done differently is as soon as I saw that nightstick I would&#039;ve ran out and stopped him. That&#039;s what I wished I would have done,&quot; Wayne says. A Harrisonburg police officer accused of killing an injured cat with a baton has been convicted of animal cruelty. Media outlets report that a judge found 25-year-old Jonathan Snoddy guilty of the misdemeanor charge Thursday in Rockingham County General District Court. Retired Judge Steven Helvin of Charlottesville ordered Snoddy to pay a $50 fine. Snoddy was charged in January following a Virginia State Police investigation. Resident Wayne Meadows told investigators that he took the cat home on Nov. 11, 2011, after a car hit the animal and called Harrisonburg authorities. Police department policy calls for an officer to euthanize an animal by shooting it, after getting supervisor&#039;s permission. Instead, Meadows said Snoddy hit the cat up to 20 times with his baton. Snoddy&#039;s attorneys say they will appeal the verdict.','http://www.timesdispatch.com/news/harrisonburg-police-officer-convicted-of-beating-cat-to-death/article_83efd3bf-ea2c-55a6-abb9-3a4f1dd360bb.html','Unknown','Jonathan Snoddy','Yes','No','NA','NA','Not Sure','NA','NA','Not Sure','Not Sure','No','Yes'),(170,'2014-08-31','Colorado','Colorado Springs','Colorado Springs Police Department&rsquo;s Gold Hill Division',1,'Claire Herrera was worried after she heard some commotion next door to walk outside and find her neighbor, Patrick Lawrence, nearly passed out on her back steps. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s holding his head, he&rsquo;s hyperventilating,&rdquo; Herrera said.  &ldquo;I went into the house and called 911 and was simply calling for a medic.&rdquo; But Colorado Springs Police arrived next door first.\r\nThis is what happened next according to the incident report filed by officers: &ldquo;On 08/31/14 at approximately 1225 hours, Officers with the Colorado Springs Police Department&rsquo;s Gold Hill Division were dispatched to a residence in the 800 block of E. Cimarron St. to investigate a possible disturbance. Upon arrival, officers were walking up to the residence&rsquo;s rear facing door. While doing so a large pit bull aggressively and quickly ran from the house and towards the officers. Noting the dog&rsquo;s aggressive behavior and stance, one of the officers fired several rounds at the animal as it continued approaching them. One of these rounds struck the dog in the rear leg, causing the dog to briefly end its advance and flee towards the house. Officers were then able to retreat and while doing so the dog again began aggressively and quickly approaching the officers. Prior to being forced to discharge their weapon again, the officers were able to close and hold the gate shut until the dog&rsquo;s owner, Patrick Lawrence (a 49 year-old resident of Colorado Springs), was able to contain the animal in a dog crate. During the subsequent investigation, officers were unable to develop probable cause to arrest anyone for the original disturbance call for service but Mr. Lawrence was arrested for possessing a dangerous animal.&rdquo; Lawrence says the only fact he agrees with in the report was that his dog was wounded. &ldquo;If the dog was aggressively trying to get at him, why&rsquo;s the dog shot in the butt?&rdquo; Lawrence asked. Lawrence believes this was a case of a dog protecting its territory.\r\n&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how he do man because he protective, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; Lawrence said. But another neighbor says the dog is dangerous&hellip;and has the scar to prove it. &ldquo;Nine stitches,&rdquo; Jay Swartz said as he pulled up his sleeve to show the scar he says is from an attack last April. &ldquo;He got me good.  Jumped up and latched onto the back of my arm,&rdquo; Swartz said. Swartz though never pressed charges but says he understands why police fired their weapons. &ldquo;If I would have had a gun on me that day, I would have shot it,&rdquo; Swartz said. Lawrence has a mandatory court appearance later this month for owning a &ldquo;dangerous animal,&rdquo; where a judge will decide if the dog is indeed too dangerous&hellip;even for its own yard. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s ridiculous man,&rdquo; Lawrence said.  &ldquo;I gotta go to court for the police entering my property.&rdquo; ','http://www.krdo.com/news/police-shoot-pit-bull/27830890','Unknown','Unknown','No','Yes','Yes','Yes','Uniform','NA','Yes','No','No','Not \r\nSure','No'),(171,'2014-08-31','Ohio','Dayton','Dayton Police Department',1,'The following is based entirely on police statements: A Dayton police officer shot and killed a dog that was reported as &quot;vicious&quot; Sunday night.

Shortly after arriving, Hammond Officer Timothy Kreischer shot the dog in the face as the family looked on. That&rsquo;s where accounts from police and the family differ. Police said the dog, Lilly, lunged at Kreischer. Trent McCain, the attorney for plaintiffs Norma Maldonado and Dario Lemus, said that&rsquo;s nonsense. He said Lilly was barking and nothing more, and it was Kreischer who became aggressive. &ldquo;He unholstered his weapon, and shot up to three times, striking the dog in the mouth,&rdquo; he said. McCain said Lilly was only five to seven feet away from a 7-year-old child when the officer shot the dog. &ldquo;Dogs naturally will bark at a stranger, but the dog was down on the ground, next to a child, as opposed to lunging at the officer,&rdquo; McCain said. &ldquo;We shudder to think what would have happened if Officer Kreischer missed the dog and shot my clients&rsquo; 7-year-old son.

Mother of four, Victoria Baca wouldn&rsquo;t live without one &ndash; in fact she had two until Thursday morning. She had called State Police to file a report about an online scam and was told that an officer would be there eventually. She told police she had errands to run with her young children and to give her a call when the officer was on his way. A few hours later she got a call, but it wasn&rsquo;t what she expected &ldquo;That the officer had jumped my fence and that my dog bit him and he killed her,&rdquo; Baca said.

Lebanon City Manager Pat Clements issued a statement clearing the police department of any wrongdoing. Based on the information I have received, it appears that the officers actions were necessary and in compliance with departmental policies, Clement said. There are currently no local or county agencies equipped to respond to sick or injured stray cats, and our options are limited. Lebanon Police Department policy is to destroy sick or injured stray cats where they are found and under no circumstances is an officer to transport the animal in a city vehicle. The policy, however, appears to violate Ohio Revised Code. Cats are one of a number of animals protected by the code that says no one shall ?maliciously, or willfully and without consent of the owner? injure animals. The violation is a first-degree misdemeanor.

A Village of Stryker resident&rsquo;s complaint brought about an investigation and court case, and led to the issue becoming news. Ada Pierson, who has three cats of her own, took it upon herself to feed several strays she felt were in need help.  Ada told Channel 13 news, &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not being fed and they&rsquo;re not being taken care of,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I felt sorry for them.&rdquo; The cats disappeared in January  after a neighbor complained about cat feces and urine on their property, and Ms. Pierson claimed the local police trapped and killed them, then disposed of their bodies. &ldquo;They were either shot or they were drowned,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s horrible, they did not deserve what got. Why Stryker Police thought it was their duty to do something, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; A cat belonging to neighbor Carol Seehand was inadvertently caught up in the sweep and was shot and killed along with the feral cats.  Ms. Seehand filed a complaint against the police chief. Ms. Pierson contacted the Williams County Humane Society with allegations of animal cruelty, and a Humane Officer lodged a complaint. The Fulton County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department opened an investigation of police practices and the matter was turned over to the prosecutor&rsquo;s office in Bryan for review. Charges were brought against Stryker Police Chief Steve Schlosser. Prosecutors said Schlosser ordered officers to trap stray cats and shoot them.  Officers then dumped the dead animals&rsquo; bodies in the river. In a court appearance last month, Chief Schlosser pleaded no contest to animal cruelty saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m taking responsibility for my actions and my officers&rsquo; actions because that&rsquo;s what leaders do.&rdquo; The judge sentenced Schlosser to pay a $500 fine.   When asked for a comment on the sentence outside the courtroom, Ada Pierson &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he should keep his job.&rdquo; On the night of Monday June 10 the Stryker Village Council voted to suspend Schlosser for two weeks without pay. Public reaction continues to be mixed, with those who were outraged at the killings and dumpings feeling that justice was not served and punishment should have been greater, and those who felt the killing of &ldquo;just cats&rdquo; was no big deal saying greater punishment was not warranted. Channel 13&prime;s Christine Long reports that &ldquo;the people who were calling for the chief to be fired are so angry they don&rsquo;t want to talk on camera. They say this is another slap on the wrist.&rdquo;','http://www.13abc.com/story/21810409/stryker-police-under-investigation-for-allegedly-killing-cats','Unknown','Police Chief Steve Schlosser and multiple unknown officers','Yes','No','No','No','Not Sure','No','NA','Yes','No','No','Yes'),(700,'2012-07-31','New York','Elmsford','Elmsford Police Department',1,'A rabies alert was posted Tuesday by the Westchester County Department of Health after a police officer shot a stray cat who attacked him after trying to attack a man and woman in Elmsford.

Another neighbor told police the dogs growled and barked at her while she took her trash to the curb. An officer shot the Pitt Bull in the chest while an animal control officer tried to catch the Husky with a pole.

Tim Brant, Derby Police, said the the Pitt Bull&#039;s behavior was threatening. &quot;Any time we deal with a vicious animal our goal is to safely capture the animal without incident,&quot; Brant said. &quot;Because of the aggressive nature of the Pit Bill reported to and witnessed by the police officer, the officer believed the Pit Bull was going to attack so he shot it to protect human life.&quot; Both dogs ran off after the shot was fired. Derby officers tracked the dogs to the railroad tracks between Buckner Street and River Street. The dogs were spotted along a thick line of brush near the tracks, but officers were not able to catch them. A homeowner in the 700 block of North Bucker called police around 4 p.m. Tuesday to report finding the dogs on their back porch. The dogs ran away again when officers arrived. The Animal Control Officer set out a large dog trap in the area and police officers monitored the area throughout the night.
