He was standing in the driveway talking to another friend when Redwood City “Task Force” drove by the house.  They took notice of the men talking and recognized one of them.  They made a U-turn and got out of their vehicle with a very aggressive approach which startled him.  Since the Task Force drive around in an unmarked car the gentleman was confused and wasn’t sure who was approaching as such, so he fled down the driveway to the back gated yard in which our dogs are keep safely.  The police ran after him and entered the yard.  I heard the commotion and quickly ran out my room.  I heard my dog barking so I rushed to the back yard only to be stopped by the police. They had the man obtained as they were handcuffing him.  They would not let me through.  I saw my dog through the doorway and he was just staying in one place barking at the policeman across the yard from him.  At that moment I heard four gunshots.  My dog then fell to the ground.  I started screaming, I wanted to go see if he was alright.  They hurried me out to the other side of the fenced yard. He was out of my sight.  I was completely panicked and keep insisting for them to let me go to him.  Finally an officer came to me and yelled “your dog is dead!!”. They still would not let me see him.  They held me back with force.  It was at least 30 minutes before they finally let me see him, then they told my friend to take me away from the house.  When I was leaving they were also taking the man away (under arrest).  I yelled at him “they killed my dog!!!!”.  The police kept telling me the reason the dog was shot was because of that man.  They said that he had a warrant. A few days later, that man came to my house.  I didn’t want to see him, for I felt it was his fault, I was mad that he could come to my home with that pending situation of an out-standing warrant.  I felt that he brought the trouble to my home. \r\n\r\nI have found that the man had no warrant, in fact he wasn’t even on probation or parole.  He had a past history, but since has changed his lifestyle and has lived free of any criminal activity for several years.  The charges he received that day were “Trespassing” (on my property) and “Evading a police officer”.  He said that while he was at the station getting processed that the police man-handled him and told him that he should “move out of town”.  He had been harassed and actually arrested twice since this incident.\r\n\r\nI don’t understand this at all.  How can the police come on my property, chase an innocent man who was scared because of their approach, and shoot my dog from 22 feet away,  not once, but four times?  They didn’t even let anyone have a chance to put him away. All “Buddy” was doing was protecting our home.  The policeman said that he had to hold a lawn chair up to keep him from getting to him.  The lawn chair he was speaking about is made of solid wood.  It is too big and heavy, even for a strong man to hold with one arm and manage a loaded gun.  When in fact the lawn chair never was moved.  The imprints in the lawn were still under the legs of the chair.  The pillow that sits on the chair was also still sitting in place.  If he had picked up that chair the cushion would have fallen off. There is no way that with all the chaos going on could he have perfectly set that chair down in the exact same place as before.  The officer was right next to two huge redwood trees with enormous trunks.  He could have easily run for cover behind one of those trees.  Better yet he could have climbed over the fence without any problems.  There were many alternatives he could have done.  Buddy was not going after him.  My roommate was also right there.  She is a dog handler/trainer.  She has tons of experience handling dogs. She is also certified animal health technician, with knowledge of handling emergency situations with dogs.  She told the police this, and yet they still would not let her even go see if Buddy was still alive.  There was nobody there who checked to see if he had truly passed. This was just an assumption from an inexperienced police officer. A man that has no right to tell me anything in regards to my dog’s condition.  Buddy was rushed to the vet. His body was still warm. He passed when he was at the vet. He was shot through the spine, neck and abdomen. There was one casing that was never found.','http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:NsCvwI10zsgJ:redwoodcity-woodside.patch.com/blog_posts/police-shoot-and-kill-family-pet-059fc4f2+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us','Buddy','Unknown','0','0',0,0,0,1,1,'Plain Clothes',0,2,2,2,2,2),(4,'2012-12-06','California','Whittier','Pico Rivera Sheriffs',1,30,1,'Pit Bull','On December 6, 2012, in the City of Pico Rivera, a Pet Pit Bull named Chico Blue was playing in his yard.

She said police told her that when they arrived, they tried to go through her backyard to get to the burglary-in-progress. They say they shook the fence to alert any dogs and heard nothing. But when the officer jumped into the yard, he saw a dog charging at him. In a statement, police said, The officer felt he was in danger of great bodily injury and fired one time at the dog. The dog was transported to a nearby animal hospital, and was later released to the owner. Police never caught the burglars. Cuevas said she understands that the officer felt threatened, but she questioned why they didnt let her know first that they needed to enter her yard. If they would have just called me, I would have helped them out, she said. Cuevas said a police officer stopped by on Thursday to give her instructions on how to seek reimbursement from the city.

One eyewitness, Charlene Dezego, told FOX 32 News that she heard the officer warned Phillips about the dog being loose, but the officer never sounded like he was in danger. All of sudden I heard him say, get your dog, and then the next statement was get your dog, and then he just pulled out his gun and shot twice, says Dezengo. Colonel was rushed to an emergency vet. Five hours of surgery saved his life. As for the officer who shot at Colonel, Al, his wife, Barbara, and Morgan said (and witnesses confirmed in TV reports) that he calmly finished writing the ticket, as if nothing out of the ordinary had occurred. While FOX 32\'s Larry Yellen was interviewing the dog\'s owners three days after the shooting, two police officers drove by the home. 90 minutes later, they came back, asked why Phillips why he had contacted the media and gave him a ticket for not keeping Colonel on a leash. Owner Al Phillips  has a pending lawsuit against the city of Chicago.','http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2012/12/04/chicago-family-says-police-officer-shot-their-puppy/','Colonel','Brandon Pettigrew','0','1',0,0,0,0,1,'Uniform',3,3,0,0,1,0),(37,'2009-02-01','Illinois','Chicago','Chicago Police Department',1,50,0,'Labrador','Teenage brothers Thomas and Darren Russell were in their second-floor apartment in the 9200 block of South Justine Street in February 2009 when officers announced they had a warrant to search both units of the two-flat.

Owner is Brittany Preston. Owner\'s attorney is Chris Olson. Preston sued the city of St. Clair Shores, police officers David Jacquemain and Jeremy Moskwa, and animal control officer Tom Massey. The lawsuit alleges that in killing Lexie, the defendants violated Preston\'s Fourth Amendment rights and her civil rights. The events leading up to the shooting began in the early morning hours of Nov. 22 when Preston\'s grandfather, who reportedly suffers from dementia, accidentally left the dog outside. Authorities were called to the scene when the dog began to bark excessively. Much of what happened next was captured by dash cams on the responding police cruisers. Before even getting out of the car, an officer is heard saying The only thing Im gonna do is shoot it, anyway. I do not like dogs. Subsequent dash camera audio captured the officers discussing various methods of restraining the dog, at which point one of them can be heard saying, I don\'t do snares, I dont do dogs ... Ill shoot the fking thing. Authorities eventually make contact with Preston\'s grandfather. He initially states he does not know who the dog belongs to. Hey, here is what I\'m gonna tell you, if this isnt your dog, then you don\'t care if I shoot it because I\'m about to, an officer can be heard telling Preston\'s grandfather. Im very close to killing this dog, do you understand what Im telling you right now? I will kill this dog. So if this is your damn dog, bring it in the house. However, before Preston\'s grandfather could allow Lexie inside, the police officers shot at her four times, with three bullets making contact, according to police. Preston\'s grandfather can be heard on the dash cam audio confronting one of the police officers about the shooting. What the f--k, you shooting it right in front of me, he asked. The officer replied, It attacked us, sir, to which Preston\'s grandfather replied, I don\'t think so. You guys ought to go on TV. A short time later, an officer shot Lexie a fourth time. The dog can be heard crying out in pain again, but is still alive. The lawsuit alleges that when the animal control officer finally arrived on the scene, the officers can be heard on the dash cam video discussing with him how to deal with Lexie, who is still breathing despite her multiple wounds. Defendant police officers asked defendant Massey if he could choke it out, the lawsuit alleges. Another police officer suggested using a shovel to kill Lexie. Defendant Massey remarked that doing so would not be a good idea because, You know this s--t is going to be all over Facebook in about an hour, to which a police officer responded, yeah, unfortunately. The dash cam later captures Massey using a catch-pole to walk a badly wounded Lexie to the animal control truck. What happened next is also controversial, according to Olson. The lawsuit alleges a licensed veterinarian performed a gross necropsy on Lexie on Nov. 29. The findings allegedly contrast with the number of shots police say were fired at the scene. The necropsy, according to Olson, identified a total of 15 bullet holes in the dog. You do the math, he said. Evidently, based on the number of bullet holes, they shot Lexie several more times once she was taken away.','http://www.freep.com/assets/freep/pdf/C4222331718.PDF','Lexie','police officers David Jacquemain and Jeremy Moskwa animal control officer Tom Massey','1','0',0,0,0,0,2,'Uniform',3,3,1,0,1,0),(39,'2014-07-24','Georgia','Unincorporated DeKalb County','Dekalb County Police',1,50,0,'German Shepherd 9yo','Tim Theall owner.

However, responding officers were unable to locate the two dogs, which were said to be pit bulls. Later on Monday, officers responded at about 5:30 p.m. to the 700 block of South Norwood Avenue on a report of a vicious dog. Ashley said several people indicated two dogs — one a pit bull and the other an unknown mix — had been chasing people throughout the neighborhood. Officers spoke with a woman who lives at 6300 E. Fifth Place. The woman said she didn’t own the dogs, which were in her backyard. However, Ashley said, she wanted them out of her yard. The dogs aggressively barked at officers and showed their teeth, Ashley said. The officers split up, he said, and each dog charged one of the officers. The two fired shots, dropping one dog immediately. The other was hit and began to run off, Ashley said, so officers fired and struck it again out of concern it would attack someone. It wasn’t immediately known if the dogs in the two instances were the same ones. The dog bite victim declined to be taken by EMSA for medical care.

Holst of Sonny Boy Lane, whose 5-year-old German shepherd, Jake, was killed by a single shot after the deputy reported that the animal lunged at him. &quot;We called them because we didn&#039;t want to lose an animal and it turned into a catastrophe,&quot; Holst said. Family members contend that Jake was shot when he wasn&#039;t a threat, but was hunkered down holding his ground 10 feet away. The deputy reported that the dog, which weighed more than 80 pounds, was only two feet away from him, snarling, barking and about to strike. &quot;At approximately two feet, I had no choice but to discharge my service weapon to protect myself from being bitten by the K-9,&quot; Deputy Michael Buenting wrote in his incident report. &quot;The K-9 received one wound to the top of the head and immediately fell to the ground.&quot; A Sheriff&#039;s Office spokesman said all signs point to the deputy following proper protocol, firing in response to danger and when an attack became imminent. &quot;We didn&#039;t see where he did anything wrong,&quot; said sheriff&#039;s Maj. John Clark, who added that the investigation is ongoing and will include an internal-affairs examination of the shooting site. Clark also confirmed that Sheriff Al Cannon met with family members Tuesday to hear their concerns. The incident unfolded May 25 after Gretchen Holst called the Sheriff&#039;s Office for help. The family had been having an ongoing problem with a neighboring family allowing its dog to get inside of the Holsts&#039; electric fence. &quot;They were careful to inform the Sheriff&#039;s Department that their call was not an emergency,&quot; said Mike Gruenloh, the family&#039;s attorney. The primary concern was the family&#039;s two adult German shepherds -- Jake and Sasha -- and their recent litter, Gruenloh said. Buenting arrived about 20 minutes after the family called, Gruenloh said.\r\nAccording to Buenting&#039;s incident report, he drove into the driveway of the Holsts&#039; three-acre property, where he saw a man escorting three large dogs to the backyard. A woman later identified as the dogs&#039; owner, Gretchen Holst, was holding her hands up in the direction of the deputy. After the dogs were out of sight, Buenting reported, he got out of his cruiser and prepared to speak with Gretchen Holst. He then saw one of the large German shepherds running toward him &quot;viciously barking.&quot; &quot;Several times Holst yelled at the K-9 to stop as the responding deputy backed up toward his patrol vehicle,&quot; the report states. The deputy gave several &quot;stop&quot; commands, as well, but the dog came &quot;extremely close&quot; and continued to bark viciously, the deputy wrote. He drew his service weapon and repeated his halt commands.\r\nThe dog continued approaching, snarling aggressively, he wrote. That&#039;s when Buenting said he fired. The family&#039;s version, as relayed by Gruenloh, is that Gretchen Holst tried to signal Buenting to wait in his patrol car while her son was putting away the family pets so the family could talk to the deputy about the problem with the neighbor. &quot;Unfortunately, he continued to drive directly up to the family&#039;s house and exited his vehicle before the family had a chance to put Jake and Sasha safely in the back,&quot; Gruenloh said. Jake reportedly became startled by Buenting&#039;s cruiser radio, Gruenloh said, and circled back, barking at the deputy.\r\n&quot;While Mrs. Holst was moving forward to secure Jake, Deputy Buenting drew his pistol and fired a single shot into the head of the family&#039;s pet, killing it,&quot; Gruenloh&#039;s account said. &quot;It was just a senseless, unnecessary use of force,&quot; Gretchen Holst said. &quot;It cost us something very dear to us. Jake&#039;s not there to greet us in the driveway every day. And I was within 18 inches of the officer when he fired the shot.&quot; Her husband said he thinks the deputy panicked and used poor judgment.\r\nGruenloh took issue with the deputy&#039;s version of the shooting. He said witnesses reported that the dog was as much as 10 feet away when it was shot. &quot;Jake was hunkered down on his back legs, holding his ground and doing exactly what he was supposed to do, barking at a stranger,&quot; Gruenloh said.\r\nAn autopsy performed by the family&#039;s veterinarian found that Jake was shot in the top of the head, Gruenloh said. &quot;Had the dog been advancing on the officer it is more likely that its head would have been up in an attacking position rather than down.&quot; Buenting remains on duty after the shooting, and that is one of several points Gruenloh said the family wants addressed by the Sheriff&#039;s Office. They also want deputies to be better trained on how to respond to animal issues, and they want compensation for their loss.v&quot;I think the officer used very poor judgment,&quot; E.L. Holst said. &quot;I am heartbroken, devastated over what I&#039;ve lost.&quot;','http://www.postandcourier.com/news/2011/jun/02/fatal-shooting-of-dog-by-deputy-investigated/','Jake','Michael Buenting','2','0',0,0,0,0,2,'Uniform',3,2,0,0,2,0),(86,'2014-06-14','Maryland','Baltimore','Baltimore City Police Department',1,50,0,'Shar Pai','Jeffrey Bolger, Baltimore City police officer, was arrested and charged with aggravated animal cruelty and other charges after cutting the throat of a dog, police officials announced Wednesday afternoon. Police were called Saturday morning to the 700 block of South Grundy Street in southeast Baltimore for a report of a stray dog that had nipped someone trying to rescue it. Sarah Gossard told 11 News that her beloved 7-year-old shar-pei named Nala had somehow escaped the gate of her back yard that morning. While she searched for the dog, including posting pictures of Nala on a community Facebook page, nearby resident Sandy Fleischer said she found Nala a few blocks away looking confused and thirsty. &ldquo;The dog was more scared of not knowing where it was and being thirsty and disoriented. The dog bit me out of fear because I tried to touch it, which was my fault,&rdquo; Fleischer told 11 News reporter Kai Reed. Police were called, and Fleischer said she watched as several officers used sticks to try to contain Nala, who she said wasn&rsquo;t being aggressive. &ldquo;You could hear the dog screaming and crying in pain,&rdquo; Fleischer said. &ldquo;I did see one officer that had been extremely aggressive that did have his knee into her chest that was tightening the noose. It seemed (they were doing it) relentlessly and unnecessarily.&rdquo; Fleischer then went into an ambulance, so she didn&rsquo;t see what happened next. Police said the officers then secured Nala using a dog pole, and an officer assigned to the emergency services division, later identified as Officer Jeffrey Bolger, went much further. &ldquo;Unfortunately, at some point after the dog was contained, one of our officers used a knife and cut the dog&rsquo;s throat. This is outrageous and an unacceptable breach of our protocol,&rdquo; Baltimore Police Deputy Commissioner Dean Palmere said. &ldquo;We have no words to describe this. To say that we are appalled at the allegations, I think, is an understatement,&rdquo; said Baltimore Police Deputy Commissioner Jerry Rodriguez. Commanders said they know of no reason for Bolger to use such force on a dog that was under control. Nala later died. &ldquo;She was just the sweetest dog and would never hurt anyone. She was just scared that day, and through all of those events &mdash; being scared and lost, thirsty, hungry &mdash; yes I&rsquo;m very sure that she bit someone, but the actions after that were not OK,&rdquo; Gossard said. She told 11 News she didn&rsquo;t find out until Wednesday that her dog was killed in such a violent way. &ldquo;This dog had a collar around its neck with tags, with my phone number. It&rsquo;s not OK,&rdquo; Gossard said. Bolger, who was also charged with malfeasance in office, has been suspended without pay. He was released early Thursday on his own personal recognizance, 11 News learned Obviously, my anger is toward this police officer. I don&rsquo;t want him to have his job. I don&rsquo;t want him to be able to go out on calls and react like that to a person, to a dog, to anything. That&rsquo;s not OK,&rdquo; Gossard said. Police are also investigating whether other officers who knew of the incident followed procedure to report it. Commanders said they &ldquo;caught wind of it Monday,&rdquo; two days later. Bolger has been with Baltime PD since 1992. Following Bolgers arrest, Thomas Schmidt, 52, of Abingdon, was also arrested, charged and released Thursday in the case. According to charging documents, Schmidt is accused of holding down the dog while the other officer, Jeffrey Bolger, killed it.','http://www.wbaltv.com/news/police-dogs-throad-cut-officer-charged-with-animal-cruelty/26553714#!0Zozx','Nala','Jeffrey Bolger and Thomas Schmidt','1','0',0,0,0,0,0,'Uniform',0,3,1,2,2,1),(88,'2013-06-30','California','Hawthorne','Hawthorne Police Department',1,100,0,'Rottweiler','Victim Max 2 year old Rottweiler. Leon Cordell Rosby, a 52-year-old man from Hawthorne, Calif., was walking his dog &ldquo;Max&rdquo; while watching a police response to a robbery on June 30. The California man was videotaping the showdown with his cell phone. Police accused him of disturbing the crime scene, and a video of the incident quickly went viral, garnering millions of views. As three officers approached him, Rosby put his Rottweiler in his car and allowed the police to apprehend him. But while he was being arrested, the dog jumped from an open car window, ran toward the officers and barked at them. One policeman shot the dog four times, causing the writhing Rottweiler to slowly bleed to death on the street. Rosby&rsquo;s knees buckled as he cried out for the dying animal. The incident outraged animal lovers and animal rights activists across the country, and the Hawthorne Police Department received letters of condemnation and death threats. In response, the police department released a second video of the incident, which showed more of the officer&rsquo;s actions before he shot the dog. More of Rosby&rsquo;s taunts to police could also be heard in the clip. After the release of that video, Rosby allegedly went to the home of the witness who recorded it and &ldquo;verbally confronted&rdquo; her and her son, police told KTLA. Now, Rosby is facing additional charges for his reaction, and is being held until his court date. Despite the public outcry against the actions of the officers, Rosby was on Tuesday charged with two counts of intimidating a witness, two counts of dissuading a witness from prosecuting a crime, and two counts of making criminal threats &ndash; all six of which are felonies. He was also charged with one misdemeanor count of resisting arrest. Mark Geragos, the attorney representing Rosby, told KTLA that police are trying to cover up the fact that they killed the Rottweiler by instead focusing on the wrongdoings of the defendant. &ldquo;The videos have shown that these cops killed this dog for absolutely no reason,&rdquo; Geragos said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s precisely why the cops now are scrambling to try to get him convicted, get him into custody and do anything else in order to try and turn the spotlight away from their actions.&rdquo; Rosby has sued the city of Hawthorne for the killing.

A neighbor called 911 just after noon to report the dog was out, but did not say it was posing a threat to anyone. Police arrived at the Wrights home one hour later to find Rosie sitting in her owners&rsquo; driveway.

The Wrights say Rosie never bit anyone and had never been declared vicious or dangerous or violated any animal control regulation.

A witness followed the suspect to the area on Wiley Street and called 911. &quot;The police suspected the robber may have gone into the back yard so they entered through a side gate. &quot;When they got to the back yard, they were confronted by a pit bull,&quot; said Hollywood Police Sgt. Lester Cochenour.\r\nThe dog was shot multiple times and died in the back yard. Williamson was angry that officers didn&#039;t knock first. He said Pup-pup was a humble dog and was great with kids, but was also trained to protect to his property. &quot;There have been a lot of break ins around here, in this area for the last year and a half or so, and I have my dog out here just for that purpose,&quot; Williamson told Local 10&#039;s Roger Lohse. Lohse reported that there are no signs on the side of Williamson&#039;s house indicating that a dog was in the backyard.

A family whose dog was shot when Fayetteville police raided their Clarendon Street home on Wednesday morning has filed a complaint against the officers. Department spokesman Gavin MacRoberts said the incident remained under investigation Friday. MacRoberts said it is standard procedure for the department to conduct an internal investigation of complaints regarding uses of force in any police matter. That investigation will look at whether police operated according to department standards. Christian Yepez and his family met with police Friday afternoon to discuss the matter, but MacRoberts said he could not share what was said because it relates to personnel matters. Yepez&#039;s mother, Pennie Yepez, said about 11 people went to the police station Friday afternoon to ask police why the family dog was killed. She said police did not offer much insight as to what happened to lead to the dog&#039;s death and family members left frustrated that their concerns were not being heard. MacRoberts said police entered the home to execute a search warrant as part of an investigation involving Yepez. He said the dog was shot after police entered, but it remained unclear what prompted police to fire on 5-year-old Nastradamus, a medium-sized mixed breed. &quot;Details beyond that are part of the internal investigation and not being released,&quot; MacRoberts said. Yepez was arrested after the raid and charged with misdemeanor possession of marijuana, possession of drug paraphernalia and maintaining a dwelling for controlled substances. MacRoberts said police seized less than 1.5 ounces of marijuana and two guns from the home. Pennie Yepez said she was not home during the raid. Her son was upstairs sleeping when police kicked in the front door about 7 a.m. and threw flash grenades, she said. The dog was sleeping on the couch by the front door, and, after police entered, the dog moved away from the door. &quot;He was in the kitchen and (police) shot him three times,&quot; she said. Pennie Yepez said the family had Nastradamus&#039; body examined by a local veterinarian with x-rays to view the full scope of his injuries. She said there was a visible bullet hole in the dog&#039;s neck, unexplained leg injuries and several broken bones.','http://www.fayobserver.com/articles/2012/09/21/1205829/?sac=fo.local','Nastradamus','Unknown SWAT team','0','0',0,0,0,1,1,'Uniform',1,2,2,2,2,2),(95,'2013-04-09','South Carolina','Myrtle Beach','Horry County Police Department',1,100,0,'Retriever','Victim Hayden 10 year old retriever. A Myrtle Beach area woman, whose dog was shot and killed by an Horry County police officer, said her dog was not an aggressive animal. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an absolute tragedy and it should have never happened,&rdquo; said Christine Orlando, whose dog, Hayden, a 10-year-old rescue retriever was killed Tuesday morning when police were called to her apartment for a civil dispute. &ldquo;He started nipping at one of the officer&rsquo;s feet. That&rsquo;s what he does. That&rsquo;s his way of saying just back up. Not in a threatening way. He never lunged,&rdquo; Orlando said Thursday morning. &ldquo;He had never done any harm to anyone in his life. He was one of the most amazing animals. He did not need to die.&rdquo; Horry County police were called about 5:15 a.m. Tuesday to an apartment at 913 Marshfield Circle for a civil complaint between two roommates regarding electricity being turned off, according to the report. The dog&rsquo;s owner was arguing with her roommate because he shut off the power to their apartment.\r\nWhen the officer&rsquo;s arrived, one officer knocked on the door and heard a dog barking, according to the report. When the dog owner opened the door, the black retriever, weighing about 100 pounds, charged out into the breezeway and attacked one of the officers, according to the report. The report stated the dog bit the other officer&rsquo;s foot, while he yelled for the woman to get her dog, but the dog continued and ignored &ldquo;any verbal or physical attempts of the complaint to restrain it,&rdquo; according to the report. The officer tried to draw his gun, but was unable to do so because the woman &ldquo;pushed down on his holster,&rdquo; according to the report. Another officer asked the woman to restrain her dog and the dog briefly ran back into the open door of the apartment. Then it ran back out into the breezeway. One of the officers used his gun and shot the dog once in the head, which killed it, according to the report. The officers did not suffer any injuries during the incident and they called Horry County Environmental Services to take the dog for proper disposal. Horry County police Sgt. Robert Kegler said the incident was not under investigation. Orlando disputed the account in the police report and said she argued with her roommate about some money due on Thursday, so he shut off the power to the apartment. Orlando said instead of continuing the argument, she called police. The apartment was dark and Orlando said she was unaware her dog followed her from her bedroom when she went to answer the door for police. Orlando said her dog did not return to the apartment and she did not grab at an officer&rsquo;s gun. &ldquo;There was a lot of yelling involved with the officers, which heightened the circumstance,&rdquo; Orlando said and noted her dog took note of the officer drawing his gun. &ldquo;I immediately acted on impulse and jumped in front of the officer and begged please do not shoot my dog. . . As soon as a he had a clear shot, he shot my dog in the head.&rdquo; Orlando said no blood was drawn and the officer&rsquo;s uniforms were not damaged by her dog nipping at their feet. &ldquo;My dog never returned back into that house. The only time my dog turned to come back into the house was when he came back in to die. I never pushed anybody&rsquo;s gun back into the holster,&rdquo; Orlando said. &ldquo;This is just insane.

Hairston said she rents another home she owns to Thompson, who dates her daughter, but he does not live in her residence and she has absolutely no connection to his alleged illegal activities. A spokesperson for the sheriff&#039;s office said they had probable cause to search Hairston&#039;s residence because Thompson&#039;s alleged drug activities were suspected to take place from Hairston&#039;s house on occasion.

Patton was shot in front of his owners James Smoak and his wife, Pamela and 17-year-old son Brandon, all of whom were handcuffed and ordered onto their knees. The family was stopped in relationship to a robbery that they had no involvement with. The event was caught on video. The tape shows the Smoaks pleaded with officers to close the doors of their car so their two dogs would not escape, but the officers did not heed them.\r\n\r\nPamela Smoak is seen on the tape looking up at an officer, telling him slowly, &quot;That dog is not mean.

I don&#039;t want him to jump out.&quot; The tape then shows the Smoaks&#039; medium-size brown dog romping on the shoulder of the Interstate, its tail wagging. As the family yells, the dog, named Patton, first heads away from the road, then quickly circles back toward the family.\r\nAn officer in a blue uniform aims his shotgun at the dog and fires at its head, killing it immediately. Patton made no aggressive or furtive movements toward the officer who killed him. A federal court jury in 2008 awarded the family 9K in compensatory damages and 192K in attorneys fees, and the Smoaks settled with the City of Cookeville for 77,500 dollars in a separate lawsuit. After the Smoaks settled with the City of Cookeville, their lawsuit against the THP officers remained. The troopers argued in court that they were entitled to qualified immunity for their actions that day, and though a Tennessee district court denied them that status, they appealed, and a higher court granted it. But the higher court also found that Bush and Trooper Lt. Jerry Andrews did use excessive force against the handcuffed man that day. Since then, the case has been slowly making its way through the appeals court system, and a jury concluded that Andrews did not use excessive force that day, but that Bush did. Bush appealed that decision, and the latest ruling is a denial of that appeal. Noting that a jury has already ruled that Bush used excessive force that day and that essentially, no new evidence to the contrary has been presented, the 6th Circuit ruling says that Bush is asking us to do what the law flatly forbids to substitute our opinion for that of the jury based on a re-weighing and reinterpreting of the evidence.

As they tried to go inside, three large pit bulls rushed them at the door. &quot;One officer, fearing that he was in jeopardy from the dog biting him, drew his weapon and fired one round striking one of the dogs,&quot; Mulligan said. It was a quick decision Mulligan says the officers are trained to make. &quot;He&#039;s there to protect himself the other officers and whoever else if the dog happens to run past him so its about protecting himself first because the dog is bearing down on him and he doesn&#039;t want to get hurt,&quot; Mulligan said. We tried the residence to see if anyone would talk to us about what happened, but no one was home. In the end, officers arrested the man they found inside the house. Officers say he was carrying a loaded gun and he was later Baker Acted. After he was taken into custody he told cops his dogs were trained to attack. The other two dogs are now with Lee County Animal Services. Officials say it&#039;s too early to tell their temperaments. The shelter will be their new home until they can be evaluated and possibly put up for adoption. We looked up some stats on how often Fort Myers officers discharge their weapons. We found between 2009 and 2011 the department totaled 15 shooting incidents --with only eight of those being against animals. The shelter will take ownership of the dogs after five days if no one comes to claim them.','http://www.nbc-2.com/story/22125048/fort-myers-police-shoot-kill-attacking-dog#.U_8_QPldXW4','Unknown','Two Unknown Police','1','0',0,0,0,1,2,'Uniform',2,2,2,2,2,2),(116,'2014-01-20','Florida','Merritt Island','Brevard County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department ',1,50,1,'Pit Bull','A Merritt Island family is looking for answers Monday after they say a Brevard County Sheriff&#039;s deputy shot and killed their family dog.

The incident was witnessed by numerous bystanders, some of whom questioned the lethal tactics taken by police. The animal barked and growled when approached but attacked no one, they said. &quot;To me &mdash; I felt like it was scared more than anything,&quot; said Randy Schamber, an employee of the Hager Parking Lot where the incident occurred around 4:30 p.m.\r\n&quot;I feel like (police) could&#039;ve done more to catch the dog. I don&#039;t understand why they had to shoot it.&quot; Police, however, said the animal was shot only after all other efforts had failed. Officers tried placing a snare around the dog&#039;s neck and attempted to subdue the animal with a Taser. Both efforts failed and only seemed to make the animal more agitated, Sgt. Bill Hickey said Wednesday night.\r\n&quot;In that moment, the officer felt he wasn&#039;t able to control the situation and believed the dog to be a danger,&quot; Hickey added. He declined to release the name of the officer, stating that an internal review will be conducted to determine if the use of force was justified. Hickey said police responded to the West King Street lot for a report of a loose dog that had chased people and another dog.\r\nWitnesses said the animal didn&#039;t go after anyone. They said the white pit bull had jumped from the partially-covered bed of a pickup truck that was parked in the lot. Schamber said the animal and another dog, which one witness said appeared to be a spaniel-type, had been in the back of the truck for at least a half-hour. He said the animals got his attention because the white dog would bark when people walked by the vehicle. After jumping from the truck, the pit bull ran toward a man who had just gotten out of an SUV with his dog. The pit bull ran up to the man&#039;s dog but didn&#039;t attack the animal, Schamber said. The man, who lives nearby, scooped up his medium-sized dog and placed it back in his vehicle, inside a dog crate. The pit bull then jumped in the back of the SUV as well.\r\n&quot;Not necessarily at (my dog), just jumped in the car &mdash; but if you tried to get close to him he&#039;d growl. But I think by this time the dog is really confused,&quot; the resident, who asked that his name not be used, said. &quot;We tried to get him out of the car,&quot; said Schamber. &quot;I keep dog treats in the booth so I ran over and got some to try to coax him out.&quot; The dog jumped from the vehicle, only to bark and growl at the men.\r\nThat&#039;s when Schamber called police.\r\n&quot;The Fulton (Theater) was letting out and there were elderly people walking through the lot. (The dog) hadn&#039;t gone after anyone but I didn&#039;t want to risk the possibility,&quot; he said. For the next several minutes, until police arrived, the animal went back and forth from his owner&#039;s truck to the resident&#039;s SUV.\r\n&quot;He couldn&#039;t get back in his own truck but it seemed like he wanted to,&quot; Schamber said. &quot;He would keep walking over and looking up. Then he&#039;d go over and jump in the back of the other car again.&quot; The dog was in the back of the resident&#039;s SUV when police arrived.\r\n&quot;He&#039;s not scowling or growling but this one cop has a rifle and he&#039;s threatening to shoot that white dog next to (the resident&#039;s) dog in the back of the car,&quot; according to Meredith Wilterdink, who works at the nearby Carr&#039;s Restaurant.\r\nThe resident refused to allow the officer to fire, refusing the officer&#039;s command to move away from the car, Wilterdink said. Police eventually placed the resident in handcuffs but he later was released with no charges filed. The pit bull eventually jumped from the SUV at which time police unsuccessfully tried to subdue the animal with a Taser. Moments later, according to Schamber, a shot rang out.\r\n&quot;The dog was running around yelping, and then a second shot,&quot; Schamber said as his eyes welled with tears. &quot;I don&#039;t understand why they had to shoot him; he didn&#039;t hurt anybody.&quot; &quot;He didn&#039;t need to be shot,&quot; the resident said adamantly. &quot;What he needed was to be tethered and maybe tranquilized. But shot ... no.&quot;\r\nRegarding the use of a tranquilizer gun, Hickey said he wasn&#039;t sure if city police still had one. &quot;In the past I believe we did. That said, it&#039;s something that&#039;s kept under lock and key. It&#039;s not something you grab and go in the heat of the moment.&quot; He also said the department&#039;s dog law officer, who typically would&#039;ve responded to Wednesday&#039;s incident, had gone off duty about 30 minutes prior to the incident. &quot;There were a lot of factors here &mdash; rush hour in downtown, a busy street, a public parking lot &mdash; that made for an unfortunate outcome,&quot; Hickey said. &quot;We&#039;re dog owners too and nobody takes this sort of thing lightly. &quot;Yes, shooting the animal is an option but it&#039;s not the one any of us prefer. It&#039;s a last resort.&quot; The owner of the deceased animal returned to his vehicle after the incident had concluded.

Russ Boring with the Springfield Police Department said officers received a 911 call from a resident near 41st and Camellia in Springfield around 6:15 p.m. The caller reported a pit bull acting aggressively in the neighborhood and running around the street unleashed. Boring said the caller told police that the pit bull was acting in a threatening manner towards a young boy. &quot;It was aggressive enough to where there was a gentleman driving down the street who was honking his horn on his car, who placed his car between the dog and the boy, and ended up having the boy get in his car and drove him away from the scene,&quot; Boring said. An officer responded to the scene. According to Boring, the officer tried to coax the dog back into the home where it came from. At first the dog was friendly, Boring said, but then it became more aggressive as the officer tried to get it back on the property. Boring said the pit bull &quot;growled, it snarled, it showed it&#039;s teeth and it became pretty aggressive.&quot; As the dog approached the officer, Boring said the officer believed he was in danger. &quot;He had to make a decision right there,&quot; he said. &quot;I don&#039;t think a Taser would have been effective with this aggressive behavior and this dog.

The dog survived. Breonna Kerr, Kiki&#039;s owner, said the dog is a rescue, and they&#039;ve had it since it was a puppy. The family was out for dinner when a friend called Kerr and otld her the dog broke free from its chain in the backyard and was loose. &quot;I pulled in my driveway and there were 5 or 6 cop cars,&quot; Kerr recalled, &quot;and my dog was cornered in my driveway and she had blood, like a gunshot to her head.&quot; \r\nPolice and Kerr took Kiki to the vet. The veterinarian who treated Kiki called where the bullet lodged &quot;somewhat of a miracle for this dog.&quot; Kiki didn&#039;t have a heavy active hemmorage and was discharged as stable patient who had received treatment, said Dr. Meg Schneck with the Emergency Veterinary Hospital.\r\nThe hospital donated services for treatment of the dog prior to discharge on Tuesday, she said. Schneck explained that she wouldn&#039;t propose surgery to remove the bullet. She said her &quot;recommendation is to leave it alone.&quot;\r\nTo remove the bullet, Schneck said a vet would have to use a bone saw and cut into fragile structures in the dog&#039;s head. Even leaving the bullet in place, she recommended antibiotics and pain medications. Kerr said her family doesn&#039;t have the money for Kiki&#039;s care. &quot;There&#039;s a chance that she could have to be put down or die from it,&quot; she said. \r\nKerr said they understand police officers need to protect themselves, but the family thinks the force was a little too excessive. &quot;People said she was trying to get back inside.

The officer fired two shots at the dog, killing it. &quot;We are saddened at the outcome and the loss of someone&#039;s pet,&quot; Pelura said. &quot;But I believe the officer&#039;s actions were necessary in order to prevent serious injury to all those in the area, including a woman and her infant child.&quot;\r\nThe teenager was transported by Fenwick Ambulance to Memorial Hospital of Salem County for treatment. The incident is still under investigation, but Pelura said he anticipated that the dog&#039;s owner would face charges because he reportedly did not have proof of vaccination or license for the dog. &quot;As dog owners, we know that we are responsible for the actions and the safety of our companions,&quot; Pelura said. &quot;Owners allowing their dogs to run at large puts both the pets and the general public in harms way.&quot;','http://www.nj.com/salem/index.ssf/2014/08/salem_officer_shoots_kills_charging_dog_police_say.html','Unknown','Unknown','1','0',0,1,0,2,1,'Uniform',3,3,0,0,2,0),(130,'2014-08-12','Texas','Houston','Houston Police Department',1,2,0,'Unconfirmed','An investigation is underway after a Houston police officer shot a family&#039;s dog while responding to a call in a southwest Houston neighborhood.

A patrol officer arrived at the scene about 10 minutes later and said upon pulling up to a residence, two dogs came out of nowhere.

A BARC spokesperson told Local 2 they have received a total of five anonymous calls about roaming dogs that mentioned that Evesborough address, but said BARC was unable to follow up because the caller didn&#039;t provide supporting information.

East Peoria Police shot and killed that dog, Bella, an eight-year-old pit bull last week. The dog allegedly attacked two people and charged at an officer. Now more than 2,500 people have signed a petition demanding justice for the dog. &ldquo;She loved people. She loved attention. She was a really happy dog,&rdquo; said dog owner Shane Ellis. That&rsquo;s how Shane Ellis described Bella, his pit bull that was shot and killed by an East Peoria Police officer August 21st. He and a friend started a Facebook page and an online petition calling for an investigation of the shooting. &ldquo;I hope we get justice. Cause I do not think it&#039;s right.&rdquo; Police didn&#039;t want to talk about the issue on camera, but according to their report, here&#039;s what happened. On the afternoon of August 21st an East Peoria officer responded to a call of two dogs running loose in the Quail Trail area. The officer found two people- one limping and one bleeding from the leg- saying they were bit by a dog. He was told both dogs belong to Ellis so he parked outside the owner&#039;s home and waited for animal control. The two pit bulls returned as he was questioning one of the bite victims. They circled the officer before heading towards Ellis&#039;s home. That&#039;s when a neighbor, two doors up the road, walked out of his house and headed towards his car. The Police Report says one of the dogs, Bella, started walking toward the neighbor. After the officer yelled at the neighbor to &quot;watch out&quot; the dog turned toward the officer, growled and started running at him. Bella got less than 10-yards from the officer when he fired those fatal shots. &ldquo;They just got a call and seen my dog and thought it was it.&rdquo; Ellis believes another neighbor&rsquo;s pit bull was responsible for attacking two people, not his dog. &ldquo;I think it was a mistaken identity.&rdquo; But according to police reports, witnesses recognized Bella by a large tumor on her backside. Ellis tells us he secures his dogs behind a chain linked fence. &ldquo;They do occasionally get out, but most generally I guess they&rsquo;re put up,&quot; says another neighbor.And whether it was Bella biting people or not, one neighbor just asks one thing\r\n&ldquo;To see my neighborhood safe. Whether it be from people or animals&rdquo; Ellis says he would also like Bella&rsquo;s remains returned. We spoke to the Tazewell County Animal control.They say they are inspecting Bella for rabies and it&rsquo;s their standard procedure to not return the dog when that happens.The Police Report indicates that Ellis was cooperative with the officer after the incident.

James Clark says he plans to file a formal complaint against the two police officers who were captured on video using force on his two barking dogs. Clark told the station he wasn&#039;t home when one of his Labrador retrievers, Max, got out of his yard and was reported to be chasing children at a nearby school. When officers arrived, a neighbor captured one of them on video shooting Max with a bean bag. &quot;My heart broke. My heart still breaks every time I hear him whimper,&quot; Clark said. &quot;You know, it&#039;s like my son here falling and getting hurt.&quot; Police say the video only tells part of the story. &quot;The officers acted very appropriately. They kept that dog from hurting them,&quot; West Covina police Lt. Ken Plunkett said, according to the station. Because the camera is so shaky, only the audio of the bean-bag shot going off can be heard, he said. The video viewer does not show the moments leading up to it. &quot;At that point, that&#039;s when the dog became aggressive and charged at him,&quot; Lt. Plunkett said. Witnesses, however, say the dogs were not being as aggressive as police claim. &quot;He was barking but not like all dramatic,&quot; witness Anna Estrada said, according to the station. &quot; &#039;Ruff, ruff.&#039; Like a dog would bark. It was a normal bark...I think the cop was being more dramatic, calling more attention on himself.&quot; After Max was shot with the bean bag, police say the officers tried to get him back in the yard, where his sister Chloe was barking behind the fence. The video also shows one of the officers using a fire extinguisher on Chloe. While watching the video, the dog owner, Clark points out where the officers use the fire extinguisher. &quot;He sprays her. And now the officers, they can&#039;t breathe themselves,&quot; he said.\r\nAgain, police disagree. &quot;The nozzle wasn&#039;t pointed at the dog and directly shot...in the face,&quot; Lt.

It was a normal day, she said, which involved watching her 5-year-old daughter play behind the house with their dog, as her infant son lied in a playpen inside the house. Ms. Shimburski&rsquo;s parents, John Shimburski and Martha Spaulding, were not at home when the day turned to chaos. At around 2:00 p.m., Ms. Shimburski recalled that she ducked inside the house for a moment to use the restroom. She became alerted to something occurring when the family&rsquo;s two dogs began barking; one was inside and one was outside the house. Ms. Shimburski said that she looked out the window and saw two vehicles parked outside &mdash; a car and an SUV &mdash; along with unidentified men, one of whom had a gun drawn. Panicked, she rushed outside toward danger to attend to her daughter, Makenna, who was accompanied by &ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; a 2-year-old Brindle Pit Bull. The Shimburski family&#039;s &quot;big baby,&quot; called Lady. (Source: Megan Shimburski) The Shimburski family&rsquo;s &ldquo;big baby,&rdquo; called Lady. (Source: Megan Shimburski)\r\n&ldquo;I heard 2 shots fired, and Lady yelp, and my daughter scream,&rdquo; Ms. Shimburski told Police State USA. The armed stranger had just shot the family&rsquo;s beloved pet in the head, with Makenna standing &ldquo;20 feet behind [the dog] in the exact same direction.&rdquo; &ldquo;He then proceeded to continue walking up the hill with his gun raised, and I screamed at him not to shoot his gun again,&rdquo; she added. Ms. Shimburski says that there was no clear indication of who the intruders were; there were no markings on the vehicles and the three men were not in uniforms. She described them as dressed in &ldquo;business attire&rdquo; &mdash; definitely not uniforms. &ldquo;I stated that I was going to call the police, and that&rsquo;s when they said, &lsquo;We are the Erie County Police,&rsquo;&rdquo; Ms. Shimburski recalled. The men began then began to request to enter her parents&rsquo; home. Ms. Shimburski declined, and tended to her children and dogs. Lady was bleeding profusely. Makenna was cowering nearby crying, &ldquo;The man shot Lady. He shot my dog.&rdquo; As Ms. Shimburski took her daughter inside, she discovered that two of the self-described &ldquo;officers&rdquo; had already entered her parents&rsquo; home, after she had explicitly told them to stay out. &ldquo;They were yelling at me to tell my daughter it was OK,&rdquo; she said. The young mom secured her daughter in a bedroom along with the second dog that had been indoors. Her parents quickly arrived after being notified about what had happened. The reason for the intrusion was finally made known when they announced that they were looking for the father of Ms. Shimburski&rsquo;s son. The family told the officers that the man they were seeking had never lived there, didn&rsquo;t receive mail at the address, and that they should have tried looking for him at his own home. The police had not brought a warrant, and said they only wanted to ask the man some questions. They continued to request a search of the home. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to GRAZE her.&rdquo;\r\nMeanwhile Lady, described as a &ldquo;67-pound big baby,&rdquo; was hiding under the deck, covered in blood. A bullet had traveled through the tissue on her head, neck, and shoulder. A large, open gash allowed blood to pour down her face into her eyes and nose. It was a shocking sight for the family. &ldquo;The officer stated that he had just &lsquo;grazed&rsquo; her, and that she would be fine,&rdquo; Ms. Shimburski recalled. &ldquo;I looked at him and said, &lsquo;You did not graze her!!&rsquo; His words were, &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to GRAZE her.&rsquo;&rdquo; The shooter &mdash; [later identified as Erie County Sheriff&#039;s Detective Greg McCarthy] &mdash; claimed he shot in self-defense because the dog was &ldquo;charging and barking.&rdquo; Ms. Shimburski says that he exaggerated the dog&rsquo;s actions and the distance he was standing from her when he fired.  No one was bitten or in danger, she said, and the dog was coming from the back to the front of the house to investigate the strange visitors. &ldquo;My child could have been shot,&rdquo; Ms. Shimburski said to Police State USA. &ldquo;She now has the idea that these people who were there to protect people are bad people,&rdquo; and added that she may need counseling. &ldquo;I stated that not all cops are bad but at this point I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s going to trust them.&rdquo; Lady ultimately survived, after an emergency surgery, 60 metal stitches, and $1,200.00 in veterinarian bills. &ldquo;The police did not leave names or numbers, nor did they show any remorse,&rdquo; Ms. Shimburski said. In fact, she had been left with no paperwork; no business card; no record whatsoever of what had happened. Regardless, the family attempted to get past the incident.  Young Makenna dealt with confused feelings about the shooting and Lady slowly recovered from her injuries at home.  Ms. Shimburski did not even have a confirmed phone number to call regarding the incident.  Until 11 days later&hellip; A &ldquo;Dangerous Animal&rdquo;\r\nThe family found that their troubles were not yet over on August 5th, when police returned for another visit.  This time, they brought paperwork: a document that read &ldquo;Order to Seize Dog.&rdquo; The Erie County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office, unsatisfied that Lady had survived the first encounter, had sought out another legal method of killing her.  Describing Lady as &ldquo;dangerous dog &mdash; pit bull,&rdquo; the document authorized deputies to &ldquo;seize the said dog harbored by the said Megan Shimburski&rdquo; and to &ldquo;hold, care for, or dispose of&rdquo; Lady, pursuant to New York&rsquo;s Agriculture and Markets Law, Article 7, Section 123. The deputy and an animal control officer took Lady away to the animal warden, leaving her with an uncertain fate.  Pending a court date on August 12th, Lady may be euthanized if found to be a &ldquo;dangerous dog.&rdquo; The document was signed by Gene R. Heintz, Justice of the Town of Sardina.  It also confirms that the men at the property on July 25th were Erie County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office detectives Graham, Noecher, and McCarthy.  The man who shot Lady was Detective Greg McCarthy. &ldquo;I am outraged and disgusted by their behavior,&rdquo; Ms. Shimburski said in an interview.  &ldquo;They put my child&rsquo;s life in danger because of their negligence.  Lady did not deserve this in any way because she is not in any way a dangerous or aggressive dog.&rdquo;  Police returned to the residence to seize Lady, the detectives declaring her a dangerous dog and ordering her to be euthanized. At Ladys court hearing, the Judge declared Lady to in fact be dangerous. The ruling forces the family to keep Lady in a muzzle, posts signs at their home warning visitors of Ladys dangerous dog status, and other penalties and requirements. The Shimburski family attorney, Matt Albert, was nearly held in contempt of court after he admittedly mouthed off to the judge because he upset with how the hearing unfolded.','http://www.policestateusa.com/2014/justice-for-lady-erie-county-ny/','Lady','Det Greg McCarthy Det Graham and Det Noecher','1','1',1,0,0,0,1,'Plain Clothes',0,2,2,2,2,2),(139,'2014-08-27','Kansas','Hutchinson','Hutchinson City Police Department',1,2,1,'Unconfirmed','The following is based entirely on an uncorroborated police statement: Hutchinson police officer shot and killed a pit bull Wednesday that had already bitten another officer and then appeared to charge the officer who shot it.

The men were on their way to visit friends in Lake Charles. They climbed into the back of a parked box truck in the near-empty parking lot of the Southwest Daily News to take shelter, Carpenter said. Before long, a police car pulled up and an officer, gun drawn, ordered them out of the truck. The officer, Brian Thierbach of the Sulphur Police Department, spotted Arzy and told the men to &quot;get your dog,&quot; according to Carpenter. He said the officer watched him tie Arzy to a nearby fence with a 3 1/2-foot leash before Thierbach handcuffed both men, ordered them to the ground facing away from Arzy, and asked, &quot;Is this dog going to bite me or attack me?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; Carpenter said he responded. &quot;He is an incredibly friendly dog.&quot; Twenty seconds later, Carpenter told HuffPost, he heard a single shot. Eric Midkiff, Southwest Daily News circulation manager, said his boss phoned him around 7 a.m., asking if he knew anything about the men in the parking lot. Midkiff &quot;took off&quot; and headed to the office, and by the time he arrived, &quot;the officer already had Brandon and the other guy on the ground.&quot; Midkiff, 33, told HuffPost he stayed about 20 feet from the men, and heard Thierbach asking if the dog was going to attack. Midkiff said Thierbach was standing on the bumper of the box truck petting Arzy. &quot;The dog was rubbing up against the cop,&quot; Midkiff said. &quot;He would rub the dog&#039;s back and then push him away. All of a sudden, he just jumped down and shot the dog in the head.&quot; Midkiff said he could see both Thierbach and the dog clearly. &quot;That dog did not bite that officer,&quot; he said. &quot;The dog was wagging his tail, his tongue was hanging out.&quot; Carpenter said he spun around when he heard the gunshot. &quot;I see my dog kind of start shaking and batting at his head,&quot; he said. &quot;I saw the blood start to run down his face. &hellip; I&#039;m watching my dog die while I&#039;m sitting in cuffs.&quot; Thierbach, Carpenter told HuffPost, &quot;seemed to be fighting back a smile.&quot; He said he asked the cop why he was smiling, and that Thierbach &quot;smirked&quot; and replied, &quot;Well, he nipped at my foot.&quot; Backup officers put Arzy&#039;s body in a trash bag and threw it into the back of a vehicle, Carpenter said. According to the Southwest Daily News, police charged Carpenter and Laliberte with trespassing and kept them in jail for a few hours.\r\nMidkiff said he watched as other officers questioned Thierbach about the shooting. Within about 15 minutes, he said, Thierbach&#039;s story changed. He first claimed to have been bitten on the calf, then on the back of his heel. Later, another officer took a photograph of his toe. A Sulphur Police Department public information officer told the Southwest Daily News that the department has launched an internal investigation.

Owners Ryan and Toni Walker. \r\nThe sheriff&rsquo;s office received a call of dogs, belonging to Ryan and Toni Walker, running loose and on a neighbor&rsquo;s property in the area of the 22000 block of FM 1541. In May one of the Walkers&rsquo; other dogs had bitten a 16-year-old boy who lived in the complaining party&rsquo;s residence. Upon leaving the Walker&rsquo;s home, the investigating deputy, John Vaught, shot and killed a charging dog, an Australian Shepherd named Blue, at the Walker&rsquo;s residence in the front yard. &ldquo;This was an unfortunate incident, and I want to publicly express my sympathy and condolences to the dog&rsquo;s owners, Ryan and Toni Walker, as I know they considered Blue to be a member of their family,&rdquo; Richardson said. &ldquo;After reviewing the discharge of a firearm report, I have decided to change our policy regarding canine encounters. The new policy will be in effect after review by legal counsel. It will outline some specific actions and strategies that should help officers avoid using deadly force against canines.&rdquo;\r\nBecause deputies frequently come into contact with dogs each day, from making traffic stops, serving warrants and conducting interviews, Jim Osorio of Canine Encounters Law Enforcement Training of Arlington will conduct a training Oct. 13-14 at the Randall County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office. Osorio&rsquo;s program includes factors contributing to a dog bite, types of aggressive dogs, dog body language, encountering dogs on the job, report writing, use of force continuum, tools of the trade and self-defense against dogs. &ldquo;This training will give officers option and strategies in dealing with aggressive and dangerous dogs and the tools on how to best deescalate these situations,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It will also provide our officers with knowledge and tactics so they can better protect themselves, the citizens we serve and the dogs that officers encounter.&rdquo; Richardson said that the Facebook page &ldquo;Justice for Blue&rdquo; contains false statements regarding the incident. Because of those statements, Richardson showed the dash camera video from the incident to press during the conference. &ldquo;Specific statements indicating that the dog was &lsquo;shot just for barking&rsquo; and that a &lsquo;child was endangered&rsquo; by the shots that were fired, are both inaccurate,&rdquo; Richardson said. When Vaught arrived at the complainant&rsquo;s house, the dogs were no longer there, according to a copy of the incident report provided by the Randall County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office. The deputy then went to the Walkers&rsquo; home, and when he attempted to exit the vehicle two dogs appeared with one charging aggressively, according to the report. Vaught reported that he used pepper spray to protect himself, but it &ldquo;had little effect on the dog.&rdquo; He wrote that once he made contact with Toni Walker, the two dogs &ldquo;became very friendly.&rdquo; The law states that dogs can run unconfined and without leashes if the owners provide a plot of land of at least 5 acres. The Walkers&rsquo; property meets that requirement, but a violation still occurs if the dogs leave the property, Richardson said. The video shows the officer coming out the home, veer out the frame to avoid going near the dog, which was under a parked vehicle. The dog runs toward the officer, which is when shots were fired. However, the officer using his firearm cannot be seen in the video. Richardson said the officer fired five times and shot the dog twice. Toni Walker then comes out of the home holding a small child. Richardson said the dog was still alive, but Walker asked the officer to shoot Blue once more to humanely kill the animal.\r\n&ldquo;The next inaccuracy on the Facebook page is that I provided an &lsquo;edited&rsquo; version of the dash camera footage to the Walkers. Be design the dash camera footage cannot be edited, or it would be of no evidentiary value,&rdquo; Richardson said.\r\nIn the video Toni Walker can be heard apologizing for being extremely upset, to which the officer replies that he understands. Before leaving the scene, Vaught can be heard asking Walker if she would like him to move the dog. She responded that she wanted to move him, and then asked Vaught to hold her 7-month-old son. Walker can then be seen picking up the dog and carrying it behind the home while Vaught follows her with the baby. Vaught then provided Walker with a card for the sheriff&rsquo;s office should she need anything or have other concerns. &ldquo;The question isn&rsquo;t whether or not this was a justified use of force; the question is &lsquo;was it avoidable.&rsquo; My answer to that question is yes,&rdquo; Richardson said. Richardson said he was saddened by the incident, especially witnessing on the video a very upset Toni Walker carry Blue behind the house. He also said that he offered to buy the Walkers&rsquo; a new dog, but was told their other dog was pregnant with puppies fathered by Blue. Richardson said he went to the Walkers&rsquo; home and gave Toni Walker a $500 check to cover veterinary expenses. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been pretty blasted over that, but I did it out of the goodness of my heart,&rdquo; Richardson said. The Walkers have stated they have no intention on cashing the check, but are looking into acquiring legal counsel.','http://www.myplainview.com/canyon/c_top_stories/article_14e54b22-2245-11e4-84ae-001a4bcf887a.html','Blue','John Vaught','0','0',1,0,0,0,2,'Uniform',1,2,0,0,2,0),(146,'2014-07-27','Missouri','Columbia','Howard County Sheriff Department',1,50,1,'Pit Bull','Victim King pitbull mix, shot with a 12 gauge shotgun.

A Howard County police officer shot and fatally wounded a pit bull in late February, upsetting the dog&#039;s owner, who said the shooting was not necessary.\r\nHoward County police, however, say the dog not only approached an officer aggressively, but charged toward him as well. &quot;I&#039;m a nervous wreck,&quot; said the dog&#039;s owner, Patty Wynston, a 71-year-old who lives in the 9200 block of Whiskey Bottom Road. &quot;She was my dog. She slept with me every night.&quot; Police were called Feb. 26 to Whiskey Bottom Road for reports of two pit bulls running loose. When they got to the owner&#039;s home, the dogs were inside, according to police spokeswoman Sherry Llewellyn. Wynston said the pit bulls, an 8-year-old named Yayo and Yayo&#039;s daughter, 3-year-old Pebbles, had accidentally gotten out earlier. She said police asked Wynston to leash the dogs and bring them out, but she didn&#039;t have enough time to do so before officers again knocked on her door &quot;The doors went open,&quot; Wynston said, &quot;and of course the dogs went out.&quot; Police said that an officer was approaching the home when one of the dogs charged out of the house toward the officer, barking aggressively. &quot;The officer backed away from the dog, which continued to charge and gain speed,&quot; Llewellyn said. &quot;When the dog was approximately three feet from the officer, he drew his weapon and fired at the dog, wounding it.&quot; That pit bull was Yayo, who later had to be euthanized. Wynston said Yayo &quot;was walking toward the officer, but she was not aggressive or nothing until he pulled his gun.&quot; The dog, she said, &quot;wasn&#039;t an aggressive dog, but when people came in our yard, even if she knew them, she&#039;d bark.&quot; Police said their records show neither dog as being licensed or vaccinated, and that Yayo&#039;s license had been revoked in Howard County in 2008. The dog was sent to New York to live with a family member, and there was no record of her having been re-licensed in the county, Llewellyn said. Police policy allows officers to fire their weapons at an animal if doing so will prevent the officer or another person from substantial harm, or if an animal is so badly injured that shooting it will keep it from suffering any further, Llewellyn said. Wynston&#039;s other dog was allowed to stay at the home, as officers did not see them running loose, Llewellyn said. A citation was issued for failure to license and vaccinate the dog. Wynston says Yayo has been cremated and her ashes are now on the mantle. &quot;I was very attached to her,&quot; she said.','http://www.baltimoresun.com/explore/howard/news/crime/ph-ho-cf-dog-shooting-0315-20120313,0,5655392.story','Yayo','Unknown','2','0',0,0,0,0,1,'Uniform',3,2,0,0,2,0),(148,'2014-07-23','Texas','Cedar Park','Cedar Park Police Department',1,2,1,'Mixed Breed 10yo','Victim is repeatedly reported as a pitbull or pitbull mix following statements by police.

Police tell FOX Carolina they were forced to shoot the dog to protect themselves. Adrien Best, who had two adults, three teens and three young children at her home Monday evening on East Franklin Street, said she heard the shots. She was inside the house when one of her sons told her police were pulling up the driveway. She said by the time she reached the front door, she heard two shots fired. She said she was immediately worried about her children playing outside. Then she realized one of her family&#039;s dogs had been shot by officers. &quot;I tried to gather the kids up to put them in the house because apparently you&#039;re not safe outside with officers where we should be because they&#039;re protecting and serve,&quot; Best said. &quot;If you show up with a gun and you&#039;re irate, then you&#039;re not protecting me so I did not feel safe.&quot; Within moments, she found out why police were at her house. They were investigating a cell phone stolen from T.L. Hanna High School. The report was initiated by the school&#039;s resource officer, who is an Anderson County deputy.\r\nThe phone had been tracked by GPS to Best&#039;s house and was being carried by a friend of her son&#039;s, who told her he had found it at school. The school resource officer called for back-up from Anderson police because the East Franklin Street is in the city. A spokesman for the Anderson County Sheriff&#039;s Office said the resource officer was not on scene yet when the dog was shot. FOX Carolina called the Anderson Police Department, who provided an incident report of the dog shooting. It was written by Officer Joseph Chapman. Part of the report said, &quot;A brown and white large dog charged myself and Captain Aman. Officers did draw duty issue weapons and felt in fear that the dog was going to attack, due to the threatening manner it was coming at officers. Captain Aman did shoot the dog with one shot, at which time the dog went into some bushes and was not a threat.&quot; But the family gave a different story, calling their dog a gentle giant. Adrian Gaines, one of Best&#039;s sons, was in the driveway when he saw officers arrive and witnessed the shooting. &quot;The dog didn&#039;t bark, show any teeth, it didn&#039;t rush them, didn&#039;t growl or anything,&quot; Gaines said. &quot;Once he shot him the first time, I&#039;m sure he was scared and that&#039;s how he got up in the bushes and he ran up in the bushes and that&#039;s when you shoot him again. He&#039;s in the bushes bleeding already and you shoot him again.&quot; The shooting of the dog was witnessed by four children, including a 13-year-old named Jeremiah. He cried for hours after the dog was killed. He and others in the family want to know why this happened.\r\n&quot;He was a good dog,&quot; Jeremiah said. &quot;He didn&#039;t deserve to die. They shouldn&#039;t have shot him. There was no point to it.&quot; Now, the family plans to file a formal complaint with Anderson police. In the meantime, the department indicates they did what they had to do to make sure their officers were safe. They said because the dog was not in a fence or tethered, there was no option. For Jeremiah, that&#039;s not good enough, saying, &quot;Something needs to happen.

When 8-year-old Zaley, daughter of Mike and Christy Packett, went to bed at night, Raccoon Baby was always beside her. Zaley was taken out of school Friday morning where she is a second grader at Forrest Hunt Elementary School so her parents could tell her the fate of her playmate of six years, Raccoon. Thursday afternoon Raccoon was found dead of a gunshot wound between her eyes in the woods about 150 yards from Mike, Christy and Zaley Packett&#039;s home off Valley View Drive in Forest City. Forest City Police Officer Sean Brooks, who also lives on Valley View Drive, was placed on paid suspension from his duties regarding shooting the neighbor&#039;s dog while off-duty. \r\nBrooks has been an officer with the Forest City Police Department since January 2013. Today he awaits news from a mid-week meeting with Forest City Police Chief Jay Jackson, District Attorney Brad Greenway and detectives regarding the shooting and any charges. According to Jackson, Brooks admitted shooting the six-year-old boxer and said it was &quot;in self-defense of his family and wife.&quot; However, there was no police incident report of any dog being aggressive and no police report was filed of shooting an animal inside city limits, which is unlawful. Another staff member at the Forest City Police Department learned from Mike the dog was missing. Mike had filed a report and also offered a reward for Raccoon&#039;s return. On Thursday afternoon the staff member put the case together and Mike was called to meet police officers in a wooded area near his house. Mike said he met them about 150 yards from his house. Raccoon was in a bag. \r\n&quot;I asked them if that was my dog. They told me he had been shot between the eyes,&quot; Mike said. &quot;Why would somebody shoot this kind gentle soul? There is no reason for this.&quot; &quot;He was an off duty officer, used his own personal weapon and said the dog was aggressive with him . . . he never came to us to tell us he had to shoot my dog,&quot; Mike said. Raccoon went missing at about 3 p.m. Wednesday after she and the family&#039;s other bulldog, Dufus, had been playing outdoors. Raccoon didn&#039;t return when she was called, Mike explained. He said that was very unusual so the search for her began. The dogs had just received a bath and Mike did not put their electronic collars on them because they were still wet. For the next 24 hours the dog was missing. Mike said he and others combed their neighborhood covering about 200 acres searching and calling for Raccoon. &quot;The worst part is we went right past them and never once did they tell us,&quot; Mike said of Brooks&#039; family. &quot;We spent a lot of time looking for our dog,&quot; Christy Packett said. Brooks was eventually fired and pled guilty to misdemeanor cruelty to animals and misdemeanor resisting a police officer. District Court Judge Laura Powell sentenced Brooks to 30 days in jail, suspended sentence, unsupervised probation for 12 months, 24 hours of community service within the next 30 days, cost of court and community service fees. Brooks was also ordered by Powell not to have contact with Mike Packett or any member of his family. Owner Mike Packet was charged with violating a town ordinance in Forest City by allowing his dog to run loose. The charge was dismissed, as the dog had run away and was not &quot;allowed&quot; to run loose.

The police chief says the shooting was justified, but the family says the action was excessive and unnecessary. Four-year-old Kenya was a German Shepherd Lab mix. She&#039;s been known to roam her Irmo neighborhood from time to time. But her family says she&#039;s never gone far and never hurt anyone. &quot;She&#039;s probably gotten out about three or four times and usually a neighbor comes by [and says] &#039;Hey, your dog&#039;s in my yard,&#039; and we go get her,&quot; said Kenya&#039;s owner Jared Mann. &quot;It&#039;s never been a big deal.&quot; When her family returned to their Charring Cross Road home after Labor Day fun, Kenya was not there. &quot;We found a note on the front door saying that our dog has been shot by Irmo PD,&quot; said Mann. &quot;We found the blood right after we found the note in our front yard.&quot; Several neighbors say they heard gun shots. &quot;My husband and me were both talking to the police officers that were here,&quot; said the neighbor. &quot;And the one who shot the dog said that she had charged him. But we had seen that dog before in our backyard and she&#039;s never shown any aggression ever.&quot; Irmo Police say they received a call from a jogger who says Kenya chased this person down the street. When officers arrived, the dog was back on its property -- in the front yard, near the steps. Mann says they&#039;ve tried many different methods to restrain Kenya, including building a fence just for the dog and putting in an electrical fence as well. There&#039;s also a chair attached to the back steps, but somehow Kenya escaped. Police say when one of the officers tried to go to the front door to find the owners, the dog charged at him. The officer says he felt threatened by the dog&#039;s aggressive behavior so he fired two shots at the dog. &quot;He charged me,&quot; said the officer in the incident report. &quot;I had to shoot him.&quot; &quot;She was still moving 30 minutes later and I asked if I could take her to the vet and they said no,&quot; said a neighbor. &quot;And that&#039;s when one of the police officers asked the other police officer to get a tarp and just covered her up.&quot; Irmo Police deny that. The report goes on to say the officer fired a third and final shot to &quot;end the dog&#039;s misery.&quot; Family and neighbors do not understand why a gun had to be fired and why the officer killed Kenya. &quot;With the dog being that close to the house, if it was in the middle of the street, it&#039;d be a little bit different I think. But the dog was on its own property so I felt he could have left the dog alone,&quot; said a neighbor. In a statement provided by the jogger, he praises the officer&#039;s candor in regard to the incident. &quot;[He] seemed equally concerned about the dog as he was about the safety of the neighborhood. It was clear that he did not want anyone or the dog to get hurt. He seemed like a true professional in control of the situation,&quot; said the statement. Irmo Police Chief Brian Buck says the officer acted in self-defense. According to an Irmo ordinance, it is illegal for any domestic animal to run at large on the streets or in public places. When asked if the officer could have tasered the dog instead of shooting it, Buck said the officer used the weapon he thought would guarantee his safety.','http://www.wistv.com/story/23324440/irmo-family-unhappy-officer-shot-and-killed-their-dog','Kenya','Unknown','1','0',0,0,0,0,2,'Uniform',3,3,0,0,2,0),(166,'2013-05-21','Nevada','Las Vegas','Las Vegas Police Department',1,30,0,'Australian Shepherd','Shouting, &ldquo;Justice for Freckles,&rdquo; about a dozen people at the Regional Justice Center on Thursday protested canine killings by Las Vegas police officers. Led by Las Vegan Sarah Hecht, whose 45-pound Australian shepherd hybrid was run down by a two-ton police cruiser earlier this year, the protestors asked for better training for police officers dealing with animals. A police spokeswoman declined to comment on the case because there was an ongoing internal affairs investigation into the incident. The investigation is expected to take several more months. Hecht, 22, was overcome with emotion while speaking of her beloved pet who was a birthday present for getting straight As in high school. An officer told Hecht he purposefully ran over the dog after it had escaped her backyard and was heading toward children playing on May 21. Freckles was dragged by the police cruiser, but lived. Hecht rushed the canine to a veterinarian. The dog licked his owner during the trip. Once there, Hecht made the difficult decision to euthanize the animal. Hecht believes Freckles escaped her backyard after he was taunted by neighborhood children. She insisted her dog would never hurt anyone and had no history of biting humans. While she was at the veterinarian&rsquo;s office, Hecht&rsquo;s father was cited with having an unrestrained dog. Following the protest Thursday, Hecht wept before Las Vegas Justice of the Peace Karen Bennett-Haron as she explained what police had done to her dog and how she had no money left after paying $1,000 to try and save her &ldquo;son&rsquo;s&rdquo; life. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have children.

They discussed what to do, and when the officer offered to put the cat out of its misery, using a night stick was the last thing Wayne expected. &quot;I went inside expecting a gun shot and then I heard it happening on my front porch. I heard at least 15-20 hits,&quot; Wayne says. The officer removed the body, but he had to clean the rest.\r\n&quot;It was nasty to say the least. I was sick to my stomach the whole time doing it. I tried to wash it off as best as I could,&quot; Wayne says. The officer told him to contact police because of damage to the house. There are stains and smashed siding around the porch. Wayne did contact police, but says they didn&#039;t get back to him. However, the department offered WHSV this statement saying they did receive the complaint.\r\n&quot;An internal investigation was conducted into this matter and appropriate action has been taken internally. In addition, the department continues to review the current procedures in handling animal complaints is to determine if any changes or modifications need to be made.&quot; Wayne says he was so shocked to act at the time, but hopes this never happens again. &quot;The only thing I wished I had done differently is as soon as I saw that nightstick I would&#039;ve ran out and stopped him.

Media outlets report that a judge found 25-year-old Jonathan Snoddy guilty of the misdemeanor charge Thursday in Rockingham County General District Court. Retired Judge Steven Helvin of Charlottesville ordered Snoddy to pay a $50 fine. Snoddy was charged in January following a Virginia State Police investigation. Resident Wayne Meadows told investigators that he took the cat home on Nov. 11, 2011, after a car hit the animal and called Harrisonburg authorities. Police department policy calls for an officer to euthanize an animal by shooting it, after getting supervisor&#039;s permission. Instead, Meadows said Snoddy hit the cat up to 20 times with his baton.

Cimarron St. to investigate a possible disturbance. Upon arrival, officers were walking up to the residence&rsquo;s rear facing door. While doing so a large pit bull aggressively and quickly ran from the house and towards the officers. Noting the dog&rsquo;s aggressive behavior and stance, one of the officers fired several rounds at the animal as it continued approaching them. One of these rounds struck the dog in the rear leg, causing the dog to briefly end its advance and flee towards the house. Officers were then able to retreat and while doing so the dog again began aggressively and quickly approaching the officers. Prior to being forced to discharge their weapon again, the officers were able to close and hold the gate shut until the dog&rsquo;s owner, Patrick Lawrence (a 49 year-old resident of Colorado Springs), was able to contain the animal in a dog crate. During the subsequent investigation, officers were unable to develop probable cause to arrest anyone for the original disturbance call for service but Mr. Lawrence was arrested for possessing a dangerous animal.&rdquo; Lawrence says the only fact he agrees with in the report was that his dog was wounded. &ldquo;If the dog was aggressively trying to get at him, why&rsquo;s the dog shot in the butt?&rdquo; Lawrence asked. Lawrence believes this was a case of a dog protecting its territory.\r\n&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how he do man because he protective, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; Lawrence said.

A puddle of blood is visible not far from Jeri Fahrenkrugs back yard. It is the spot where she said police shot and killed her pit bull from 30 feet away. I feel like I lost a child pretty much. I have been crying all day, Fahrenkrug said. I felt like the police officer shot my dog because he wanted to, because my dog was a pit bull. I don’t think that it was right. Fahrenkrug said killing her dog was unnecessary and cruel because it wasnt hurting anyone. Newton police said the dog got loose from its leash and tried to bite a man passing by. When an officer arrived, police said the dog lunged at him, too. At that point, obviously, he felt there was a threat to him or to other peoples safety, so he made a decision to shoot the dog, said Lt. Wayne Winchell, of the Newton Police Department. Neighbors, who said they saw the shooting from their front porches, disagreed. That dog did not charge at that officer at all. It was like being shot in the back, said witness Cindi Crady. Fahrenkrug said her dog, Griz, who was named by her 4 year old daughter, was gentle and more like a member of the family than a pet. He is not vicious. He cuddles at me. He cuddles with my daughter. He is very friendly toward everyone, Fahrenkrug said. I dont think that he is replaceable. It was very unnecessary. I own three dogs. I am a dog lover, and what happened to that dog should not have happened at all, Crady said. The investigation is ongoing, police said. Officers said they believe the dog bit someone a few weeks before the shooting.','http://www.kcci.com/news/central-iowa/Officer-shoots-kills-family-s-dog/-/9357080/16620586/-/9ou939/-/index.html#ixzz26bjvBzry','Griz','Ron Cook','2','0',2,0,0,0,2,'Uniform',3,2,0,0,2,0),(180,'2012-08-13','New York','New York','NYPD',1,50,1,'Pit Bull','NYPD shoots homeless man\'s dog because he barked.

reproduced from the Associated Press. It describes an illegal search performed by police officers John OHare and Anthony Pia, and the killing of a harmless dog in front of a twelve year old girl by those same police. It then describes a lawsuit brought against John OHare and Anthony Pia by the twelve year old girl and her father, Glenn Harris: A Connecticut citys reputation as one of Americas most dangerous communities did not give police officers the right to invade a yard where they killed a family dog after getting an erroneous tip that guns were hidden in an abandoned car behind the home, a federal appeals court said Thursday. In reversing a jury verdict, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan put a spotlight on the Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches and seizures, especially in high-crime neighborhoods. A three-judge panel said a trial can decide damages owed by the city of Hartford after two police officers lacking a warrant or probable cause entered the yard in December 2006, where a 12-year-old girl was playing after school with Seven, her St. Bernard. The girl, identified in papers only as K.H., testified she heard two shots shortly after the dog ran around to the front yard. She said she found Officer JohnMichael OHare with the dog, which was lying in the grass, panting, with its tail wagging and its tongue out. She recalled screaming: Dont shoot my dog! She said the officer looked at me, leaned over, and he shot him in the head. Then, she added, he told her: Sorry, Miss, but your dogs not going to make it. In a pretrial deposition, OHare testified the dog had rushed in rage right at us and made a low growl, like a dog would do when it was about to attack. It was snapping its teeth and it was growling, it was coming to get me, the officer said. He said he saw the girl after the shots were fired and said nothing to her. The appeals court said lawyers for the city and officers had overvalued Hartfords high crime rate as an exigent circumstances justification to enter the yard. Taken to its logical end, this argument would permit exigent circumstances anytime there is a tip about illegal guns being located somewhere in a high-crime neighborhood or city, and would allow the exception to swallow the rule, Circuit Judge Rosemary Pooler wrote. The city of Hartfords attorney declined to comment. Lawyers for the officers did not immediately return messages. The girls father, Glenn Harris, testified at a May 2012 trial that his daughter needed hospitalization and antidepressants afterward and still believes she should have prevented the shooting. In a statement issued Thursday by attorney Jon L. Schoenhorn, the girl thanked her father, who brought the lawsuit, for getting Seven the justice he deserves. She said the dogs death had been hard on her entire family, especially herself. Seven was my brother, my companion, my everything, she added. Harris said in a statement that he wanted to thank a Hartford Police Department employee who came to the home to apologize after the shooting. He said the ruling reaffirms that your rights are the same, regardless of where you live. Schoenhorn called the decision significant for making clear that areas outside a home are protected from unreasonable searches.','http://articles.courant.com/2012-05-17/news/hc-hartford-dog-shoot-0518-20120517_1_family-dog-front-yard-bark-and-snarl','Seven','John O\'Hare and Anthony Pia','2','0',1,0,0,0,0,'Uniform',0,1,0,0,1,0),(201,'2012-06-01','New York','Penfield','Monroe County Sheriff Department',1,50,1,'Pit Bull 7yo','Dog shot and killed during police call','http://rochester.ynn.com/content/top_stories/586597/dog-shot-and-killed-during-police-call/','Diablo','Sean LeClair and Matt Clancy','2','0',0,0,0,2,2,'Uniform',3,2,0,0,2,0),(203,'2012-06-05','Texas','Florence','Florence Police Department',2,30,1,'Rhodesian Ridgeback and Pit Bull','Florence police chief of shoots family\'s 2 dogs','http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/06/06/family-says-texas-police-chief-shot-their-dogs/','Sassy and Boomer','Julie Elliott-Abshire ','0','0',1,0,0,0,2,'Not Sure',0,2,0,0,2,0),(205,'2012-08-03','Ohio','Greenfield','Greenfield Police Department',1,2,0,'Mixed Breed 18yo','Dog shot by police, her only crime was being old.

A Salem Police officer setting out to shoot a pit bull ended up shooting a man who apparently tried to place himself between the gun and the dog. A Salem Police officer was firing at the pit bull, a spokesman says, when 38 year old Steven Deleon jumped in, apparently trying to intervene in the situation. The incident occurred at 2020 Park Ave NE in Salem at approximately 1520 hours on October 20. Salem Police Officers Darren Buchholz and Travis Brossard were in the residence speaking with people when they were reportedly attacked by a pit bull. Officer Buchholz says he attempted to push the dog away, but when the dog continued to attack he drew his firearm and shot the animal in self defense. Deleon was struck by the gunshot in the foot and was transported to Salem Hospital with non-life threatening injuries. Officers Buchholz and Brossard are not injured and will both be placed on administrative leave as is standard procedure while the incident is being investigated. The Oregon State Police will be coordinating and conducting this investagation. Salem Police Lt. Dave Okada tells Salem-News.com that this is standard procedure for the Salem Police Department to request the Oregon State Police conduct an independent investigation of incidents of this nature.

D.C. police officers soon got involved, and at some point, one of them shot and killed the larger dog, described as either a pit bull or Shar-Pei mix. The disagreement is in the details. Aaron Block, 25, of Dupont Circle said he was walking his 2-year-old Shar-Pei mix, Parrot, up 18th Street when the dog suddenly turned around and bit a poodle that was passing by. He said he separated the two dogs -- cutting his hand inside Parrots mouth in the process -- and was subduing his dog when police arrived. Thats when a D.C. police officer took over, putting his knee in the middle of Parrots back while he pulled the dogs forelegs behind him, Block said. He said that the officer then grabbed Parrot by his neck and threw him over a banister at the Brass Knob antique store and that just as the dog righted itself, the officer pulled out his gun and fired. Parrot was a full 12 to 15 steps away, Block said, and was making no aggressive overtures. The dog, he noted, doesnt handle stairs well. The officer drew his gun in an unnecessary act of cowboy gunslinging law enforcement and shot my dog amidst a crowd of thousands, said Block, who was fostering Parrot while he was waiting to be adopted through the Lucky Dog Animal Rescue. The problems here are almost too numerous to count. Blocks account is supported by at least one witness, Jennifer Naideth, 29, who was in town from Los Angeles selling cosmetics at the festival. She called the shooting so unnecessary and so violent, adding that there was no human life in danger. Police and others had a different perspective. Jacob Kishter, commander of the 3rd Police District, said that once the officer pushed the dog down the stairwell, the dog immediately turns and runs at the officer aggressively. The officer, 25-year-veteran Scott Fike, fired one shot, fatally wounding the dog, which police described as a pit bull. Its definitely going to be justified based on everything that we know, Kishter said, adding that police interviewed the officer, the owners of both dogs and other officers on scene. The police account also has witness support. Tony De Pass, 67, a former D.C. police officer who lives in Northwest, said that the dog was charging directly at him when Fike drew his gun and fired and that if the officer hadnt shot the dog, the dog would have got one of us, either me or the officer. What he did, I would have done the same damn thing, De Pass said. Block, though, said he sees the polices response as an attempt to cover up what he considers the executing of his pet. He said that he would walk with Parrot to and from work every day and that he was a very people-friendly dog, with absolutely no bite history. The incident unfolded before hundreds of revelers at the heart of the Adams Morgan celebration, disrupting an otherwise peaceful afternoon. Eric Jost, 26, of Cleveland Park said he watched a young girl with a butterfly painted on her face become hysterical as she witnessed it all. Soleiman Askarinam, the owner of Spaghetti Garden on 18th Street, said the days revelry was suddenly punctuated with screams and angry dogs barking, then a gunshot. For a second, he said, it was very scary.','http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/12/AR2010091203938.html','Parrot','Scott

Department',1,50,0,'Boxer 4yo','Another family dog is dead after being shot to death in front of the two boys who owned the dog, and a friend they were playing ball with. This recent dog shooting occurred on July 5 in Houston when two brothers and one of their neighborhood friends went to retrieve a ball that had gone over their backyard fence. The ball went into an open field, and the boys and their dog, a boxer named Gunner, went to retrieve it. It was then Mark Condon, Senior Police Officer Homicide Division for the Houston Police Department, shot and killed the family dog. He was not on duty at the time of the shooting. According to a report by KHOU News, Gunner went over to check out Officer Condons dogs and is said to have startled Condons wife while the family was taking a walk. Condons wife fell down, but was uninjured. The children, all 12-years-old or younger, called out to Gunner after they had retrieved their ball. Gunner was headed back to his own yard following the three boys when Officer Condon shot Gunner in the neck, within feet of the children. These boys watched as Gunner died in his familys arms on the way to the vet. Do police no longer care that they are killing family dogs within feet of the children who own them? Are these police officers positive their bullets will always hit their mark? Imagine what would have happened it the bullet had gone a bit off target, or if one of the children had moved in the wrong direction. Houston would be dealing with a dead child instead of a dead dog. This dog wasnt attacking anyone. Gunner had simply followed his young masters as they enjoyed some playtime in their back yard. Why are police given the right to shoot and kill family dogs? If this were an average citizen who had done this, the person would likely have been charged with discharging a firearm in a residential community, as well as cruelty to animals involving death. Police are under the impression they can fire their weapon anywhere at any time and not be held accountable. Perhaps this impression is founded because almost all dog shootings by police, whether on duty or off, clear the officer involved of any wrongdoing. Even in this case, youd have the word of children as to what took place. Who will be more likely to be believed as telling the truth? The boys or the police officer?','http://www.khou.com/news/local/HPD-officer-shoots-pet-boxer-after-alleged-attack--214672271.html','Gunner','Mark Condon','0','0',2,0,0,0,0,'Plain Clothes',3,3,2,2,2,2),(264,'2013-01-18','California','Selma','Selma Police Department',5,2,1,'Unconfirmed','Officer kills 5 caged dogs at animal shelter','http://www.kmph-kfre.com/story/20757982/cop-shoots-kills-5-dog-at-animal-shelter','Unknown','Unknown','0','0',0,0,0,0,0,'Uniform',2,1,2,0,0,0),(267,'2013-02-28','Michigan','Grand Rapids','Grand Rapids Police Department',1,50,1,'Pit Bull 4yo','Two officers follow a juvenile home for throwing snowballs, shoot dog 11 times. \"The officers are trained to fire until the threat is eliminated or is reduced\"','http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2013/02/owners_of_pit_bull_shot_by_pol.html#incart_river_default','Chewy AKA Chewey','Two Unknown Police','0','0',1,2,2,1,1,'Uniform',3,2,2,2,2,0),(268,'2013-02-26','Indiana','Fishers','US Marshalls',1,2,0,'Unconfirmed','No charges against U.S. Marshal who shot small dog on harness','http://www.theindychannel.com/news/local-news/police-no-charges-for-us-marshal-who-shot-small-dog','Reese','William Brown','0','1',0,0,0,0,0,'Plain Clothes',3,3,0,0,2,0),(269,'2013-01-14','Colorado','Denver','Adams County Sheriffs Department',1,30,0,'Border Collie and Blue Heeler mix 8yo','Police respond to wrong address, kill 8-year-old blue heeler/border collie mix This is not the first fatal shooting involving Deputy Europe.

Keeping him company on his shoulder is his new pet lizard Lizlee helping him ease the pain of losing his faithful companion, Shiner Bock, a German Shepherd rescue, who had been his shadow since 2004. Hes been with me for 9 years. Every time Im gardening or at an art show or at a festival doing art. Anywhere I am, hes always been with me, Reyes said. Reyes says on April 24 around midnight, he was in his storage unit on Stassney getting ready for an Eeyores Birthday afterparty where he was going to present some of his art. Reyes says theres an onsite property manager who allows him 24/7 access. Police say they were called to that area because of suspicious activity, possibly theft  something they say happens in that area a lot. Shiner was asleep at my feet, he started growling. I told him to be quiet to stop growling. He was quiet for a few minutes then he started growling again, Reyes said. Then, Reyes saw a flash of light outside the storage unit. I was probably over here coming out still. And he got shot the first time and was running that way. I didnt see the first shot but I saw the multiple shots going that way until he finally laid down. He was crying and screaming for his life and he finally laid down 50 feet away and died over there, Reyes said. Thats when he says officers cuffed him and after an hour or so went by, they finally figured out he wasnt a thief and let him see Shiner. I lit some Sage and they let me Sage my dog and send his spirit on and bless him and thank him for the protection that he offered me in taking a bullet for me instead of me getting shot, Reyes said. Austin Police tell FOX 7 the dog started barking aggressively and showing his teeth. So the officer gave the dog commands to back up. The officer was in fear that the dog was about to attack and then he fired his weapon, said Jermaine Kilgore with Austin Police. We asked why pepper spray couldnt have been used instead. If a dog is acting aggressive towards an officer and the officer feels that the dog is going to attack, the officer is not going to pull pepper spray. Hes going to eliminate that threat, the dog. And the only way to do that with the options that we have is with lethal force. So were not obligated to pull pepper spray when we have an aggressive dog that appears to be trying to attack us. Thats just not the way were trained and thats just not what the department expects of us, Kilgore said. Of course we are sorry, we are apologetic. I mean but...most dogs are protective. They protect their property, they protect their owners. You know, officers have a difficult job when they go out to these calls, Kilgore said. Reyes says that night, the officer who shot Shiner did apologize to him. I walked up to him and I said I hear what youre saying, I hear you apologizing. And I forgive you. So I forgave him that night. And thats grace. Thats what we can do when bad things happen, we can still have a little grace. I wish the police officers would have a little grace when they operate, Reyes said. Just a reminder, last year after a dog named Cisco was shot by police, Austin PD reevaluated their training to use less lethal alternatives with dogs  unless they felt the dog might injure them. The only inconsistency with this story is that Reyes says police continued shooting Shiner even as he ran away. Austin Police say that wasnt the case...they only shot once. Weve filed an open records request with Austin PD for dashcam video and audio to clear that up. Well bring that to you as soon as we get it. Julian Reyes retained attorney Daphne Silverman and has filed a lawsuit against the Austin Police Department. Reyes has filed a request for one million dollars.','http://www.myfoxaustin.com/story/22659032/austin-man-fights-for-dog-shiner-after-he-says-police-killed-him','Shiner Bock','Unknown','1','0',0,0,0,0,2,'Uniform',1,3,0,0,1,0),(586,'2012-01-17','Georgia','Conley','DeKalb County Police Department',1,50,0,'German Shepherd','DEKALB COUNTY, Ga. &mdash; A homeowner was held at gunpoint and his family pet was killed in a mix-up involving a DeKalb County police call. &ldquo;When I ran to the garage and saw my dog laying there dead and I&#039;m looking at blood, I lost it,&rdquo; Bobbie Currie said. Around 9 p.m., a DeKalb officer went to her home on Silva Court in response to a domestic dispute call with a possibly armed person. The officer said the family&rsquo;s German shepherd lunged at him, so he killed the dog. The recently rescued animal was chained in the garage when the shooting happened. Currie&rsquo;s husband, Anthony, said the officer also pointed his gun at him and told him to put his hands up. &ldquo;I said, &lsquo;Why [did] you shoot my dog?&rsquo; And he said, &lsquo;Well, I&#039;ll blow your brains out.&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;Hold on a minute, you just killed my dog.

City officials fail to enforce existing state and local laws regarding animals. The case involves a Bloomfield police officer, who admitted that on January 21, he trapped Larry, a two-year-old neutered cat who belonged to a local resident, shot him immediately and dumped his body behind a city maintenance shed.&ldquo;The Officer openly admitted this series of events took place, and was given a mere written warning.

According to local residents, this law is routinely violated, Robinson said.\r\n\r\nAdditional local and state laws broken by the Officer&rsquo;s action:\r\n\r\nBloomfield ordinance &sect; 6-106&mdash;states that owners of cats and dogs found outside &ldquo;shall be notified in writing by the Police Department of their violation,&rdquo; meaning Larry should have been impounded and the owners notified that he was at large.

Lebanon City Manager Pat Clements issued a statement clearing the police department of any wrongdoing. Based on the information I have received, it appears that the officers actions were necessary and in compliance with departmental policies, Clement said. There are currently no local or county agencies equipped to respond to sick or injured stray cats, and our options are limited. Lebanon Police Department policy is to destroy sick or injured stray cats where they are found and under no circumstances is an officer to transport the animal in a city vehicle. The policy, however, appears to violate Ohio Revised Code. Cats are one of a number of animals protected by the code that says no one shall ?maliciously, or willfully and without consent of the owner? injure animals. The violation is a first-degree misdemeanor. Clements did not comment on the apparent violation, the Western Star reported.','http://www.officer.com/news/10342180/family-wants-policy-changed-after-ohio-police-kill-cat','Haze','Unknown','1','0',0,0,0,0,2,'Uniform',3,3,0,0,2,0),(689,'2012-06-23','South Dakota','Rapid City','Rapid City Police Department and Game Fish &amp; Parks',1,100,0,'Mountain Lion','A Rapid City family received an unwelcome guest on Saturday morning -- a mountain lion.\r\n\r\nRapid City police were called to the residence on Reservoir Road to find the lion hiding in a machine shed.

The animal control officer tried unsuccessfully to trap the cat, and called for help from a supervisor after the cat tried to bite him, Sanborn said. &ldquo;After some discussion, they had some concern there was a rabid cat in the neighborhood that they were unable to capture,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They decided the best way to deal with it so no one else was harmed was to shoot the cat.&rdquo; The police officer shot the cat with a 16-gauge shotgun loaded with pellets.

A Village of Stryker resident&rsquo;s complaint brought about an investigation and court case, and led to the issue becoming news. Ada Pierson, who has three cats of her own, took it upon herself to feed several strays she felt were in need help.  Ada told Channel 13 news, &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not being fed and they&rsquo;re not being taken care of,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I felt sorry for them.&rdquo; The cats disappeared in January  after a neighbor complained about cat feces and urine on their property, and Ms. Pierson claimed the local police trapped and killed them, then disposed of their bodies. &ldquo;They were either shot or they were drowned,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s horrible, they did not deserve what got. Why Stryker Police thought it was their duty to do something, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; A cat belonging to neighbor Carol Seehand was inadvertently caught up in the sweep and was shot and killed along with the feral cats.  Ms. Seehand filed a complaint against the police chief. Ms. Pierson contacted the Williams County Humane Society with allegations of animal cruelty, and a Humane Officer lodged a complaint. The Fulton County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department opened an investigation of police practices and the matter was turned over to the prosecutor&rsquo;s office in Bryan for review. Charges were brought against Stryker Police Chief Steve Schlosser. Prosecutors said Schlosser ordered officers to trap stray cats and shoot them.  Officers then dumped the dead animals&rsquo; bodies in the river. In a court appearance last month, Chief Schlosser pleaded no contest to animal cruelty saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m taking responsibility for my actions and my officers&rsquo; actions because that&rsquo;s what leaders do.&rdquo; The judge sentenced Schlosser to pay a $500 fine.

Another neighbor told police the dogs growled and barked at her while she took her trash to the curb. An officer shot the Pitt Bull in the chest while an animal control officer tried to catch the Husky with a pole. In a release issued Wednesday, police said the Pitt Bull circled around the Animal Control Officer growling and barking. Lt. Tim Brant, Derby Police, said the the Pitt Bull&#039;s behavior was threatening. &quot;Any time we deal with a vicious animal our goal is to safely capture the animal without incident,&quot; Brant said. &quot;Because of the aggressive nature of the Pit Bill reported to and witnessed by the police officer, the officer believed the Pit Bull was going to attack so he shot it to protect human life.&quot; Both dogs ran off after the shot was fired. Derby officers tracked the dogs to the railroad tracks between Buckner Street and River Street. The dogs were spotted along a thick line of brush near the tracks, but officers were not able to catch them. A homeowner in the 700 block of North Bucker called police around 4 p.m. Tuesday to report finding the dogs on their back porch. The dogs ran away again when officers arrived. The Animal Control Officer set out a large dog trap in the area and police officers monitored the area throughout the night.

Sheriffs in Zanesville, Ohio, a  mostly rural area about 55 miles east of Columbus, have been working with zoo officials and wildlife expert Jack Hanna and agreed on a shoot-to-kill order, considering the immediate danger presented to the community. &quot;If you had 18 Bengal tigers running around this area, you folks wouldn&#039;t want to see what would happen,&quot; Hanna said at a press conference. The deceased animals include a wolf, six black bears, two grizzly bears, nine male lions, eight lionesses, a baboon, three mountain lions and 18 tigers, authorities said.

At approximately 3:12 p.m. Sunday, officers were dispatched to 905 N. Court, in reference to a domestic disturbance. When the officer arrived, he observed a pit bull that did not have on a collar. The officer asked the female, at the residence, if the dog belonged to her and she said it did. According to Ottumwa Police Chief Tom McAndrew, the situation escalated quickly almost immediately after the officer asked who owned the dog. &ldquo;The dog began to charge the officer and attempted to bite him. The officer drew his service weapon and discharged one round at the dog, striking it once in its front right leg near the elbow,&rdquo; said Chief McAndrew. The gunshot did not kill the dog and it was transported to a local veterinarian clinic.  &ldquo;The police officer transported the dog and the dog&rsquo;s owner to the vet, because the owner did not have a vehicle,&rdquo; said McAndrew. Sunday&rsquo;s incident was, reportedly, not the first time the Ottumwa Police encountered this pit bull. \r\n&ldquo;The dog had been ordered out of Ottumwa a few weeks ago, due to the city&rsquo;s ordinance against keeping pit bulls inside the city limits. The owner had advised that the dog had been removed from the city limits,&rdquo; said McAndrew. &ldquo;Our Community Service Officer Jeff Williams is actually in Arizona for training right now. When he returns, we will be able to determine the date that the pit bull was ordered out of the city and then we will determine if there will be any charges filed against the owner.&rdquo; The dog will remain at the veterinary clinic until Officer Williams returns from training. &ldquo;Once the dog was treated, the police department decided that the dog would be impounded at the veterinarian&rsquo;s office until we decide what we will do with the dog,&rdquo; said McAndrew. \r\nThe officer, who shot the dog, is not on administrative leave. However, the police department will take steps to determine that the officer took the correct action, in shooting the pit bull. &ldquo;We will look at the incident and determine whether he acted appropriately and go from there,&rdquo; said McAndrew. &ldquo;Looking at the reports, it looks like the officer did an outstanding job and did what he was supposed to. It looks to me that he was justified in shooting the dog and we are lucky that it didn&rsquo;t kill the dog, fortunately for the dog.&rdquo; Although the dog lived through the incident, it is unclear what his fate will be. &ldquo;What we have to decide now is whether we are going to let the owner have the dog or if we are going to put the dog down. We had reports from some of the neighbors, after the shooting, who stated that they had been chased by and attacked by the dog as well.

The rat terrier and shih tzu mix isn&#039;t using her custom-made ramp to get to her fenced side yard, either.\r\nHer death, reportedly from a bullet fired by a Chaffee police officer Feb. 19, has prompted the Missouri Department of Agriculture to order a shutdown of Chaffee&#039;s animal impound and a separate investigation by the Scott County Sheriff&#039;s Department involving Chaffee police, the town&#039;s mayor and city workers. Police chief Jim Chambers was fired by the city council in a closed meeting, but members won&#039;t say why. According to a copy of the incident report about the dog&#039;s shooting obtained by the Southeast Missourian, it was the mayor who suggested that city employees shoot the dog and dispose of its body. A dispatch log shows that a dispatcher was later ordered to not tell the dog&#039;s owners about the fate of their pet. But it appears that no criminal charges will be filed in connection with the dog&#039;s death. According to a news release from Scott County Prosecuting Attorney Paul Boyd&#039;s office issued Thursday, the sheriff&#039;s department submitted probable-cause affidavits to Boyd on Feb. 28 requesting that Chaffee Mayor Steve Loucks be charged with animal abuse and making a false declaration. The sheriff&#039;s department also requested a false declaration charge for Chambers. Boyd turned the request over to Butler County prosecutor Kevin Barbour a short time later to avoid a conflict of interest, since he often works with the Chaffee Police Department. Boyd&#039;s office received a letter Thursday from Butler County that stated that upon review of evidence, a criminal conviction could not be supported and the Elfrink family would be &quot;better suited to seek civil damages.&quot; A copy of the Feb. 19 incident report and a dispatch log of the Chaffee Police Department from the same date was obtained Wednesday by the Southeast Missourian. Robert Ludwig, the officer who shot the dog, writes that on the day the dog was picked up by a city worker, the mayor and the police chief told him to take it out to the city compost site and shoot it, and that Chambers advised him to &quot;keep it quiet and not tell anyone.&quot; The report says the police department received a call around 1 p.m. from a Chaffee resident who said a dog had been outside the resident&#039;s apartment for most of the day and appeared to have mange. Ludwig responded to 537 W. Yoakum St. and then called the station to have a dispatcher request the city&#039;s animal control officer, Jerry Laxton. Ludwig also thought the dog had mange. The dispatcher could not reach Laxton, so Ludwig drove to Rhodes 101 store in Chaffee, where Laxton works part time. As they talked about the dog, Loucks entered the store and was told about the dog and that the officers weren&#039;t sure what to do with it. It was then, Ludwig wrote, that he suggested taking to the dog to a veterinarian, but Loucks said no and to take the dog out to the city compost site and shoot it. Ludwig and Mark Lueder, a city employee who picked up the dog, met at the compost site around 3 p.m. Ludwig wrote that he went to the site because Lueder left a message at the police station that he did not have a gun. When Ludwig arrived, Lueder had already dug a hole. &quot;I then loaded a range round into my service weapon and then Mark placed the dog into the hole. At that time I took aim and shot the dog once in the head,&quot; Ludwig wrote. According to the report, Lueder covered the hole, and the two men left. Dispatcher logs show Jennifer Elfrink called the police station at 4:30 p.m. and reported her 14-year-old dog, which was blind and deaf with back legs that did not work properly and looked like it had mange, was missing. She told the dispatcher the dog did not have mange but suffered from another virus and was on medication. The log says Ludwig was advised of the call. At 6:15 p.m., logs show, Elfrink called back and said she was worried someone would find the dog and think it was sick or abused. The dispatcher wrote he advised Elfrink that he was not aware of a dog being located. Close to midnight, Elfrink called back a third time and said she was driving around looking for the dog with her children in the car and that she was worried. The dispatcher checked the log, saw a dog was found and disposed of, and called Chambers. At midnight, Chambers is listed on the log as telling the dispatcher not to tell Elfrink anything. Chambers could not be reached at his home number Thursday. Acting police chief Dustin Jarrell was not at the police station Thursday and would not return to work until this morning, according to a communications employee at the department. Loucks was reached by phone Thursday at Chaffee City Hall before the Boyd&#039;s release was sent to media. Loucks said he could not comment because the incident was under investigation and that he was advised not to. He also wouldn&#039;t comment on who was advising him. The Southeast Missourian requested the city&#039;s ordinances relating to dogs during the call and received the documents at city hall Thursday afternoon. State law requires all incorporated cities or towns to collect dogs found running at large without collars and place them in a pound. The city shall keep dogs for five business days and allows euthanasia using humane methods if the animal is not claimed by its owner by the end of that period. Section 270.150 of Chaffee city ordinances state an animal not redeemed within seven days becomes city property and shall be placed for adoption or humanely euthanized. The city&#039;s pound was found to be unlicensed under the Animal Care Facilities Act during a March 6 investigation by the Department of Agriculture. In a March 5 email to Loucks, Animal Care program manager Matt Rold wrote that a complaint filed by a Chaffee resident prompted the investigation. Loucks said Thursday that the city&#039;s pound could not receive animals but that police could still deal with animals if one caused harm or threatened to cause harm, per instruction of the Agriculture Department. The investigation found numerous issues, including that the impound did not meet requirements for cleaning, food storage, waste disposal, shelter, construction of facilities, identification of impounded animals, record keeping, handling of animals or minimum holding period. The inspection report also says the city must go through the application process and meet all requirements by April 6. &quot;We won&#039;t be back open until some changes are made,&quot; Loucks said. Scott County Sheriff Rick Walter said the probable-cause affidavit requesting charges for Loucks and Chambers could not be released unless a prosecutor filed charges. Walter said he was aware that Jennifer Elfrink had contacted the Agriculture Department to file a complaint and that she shared with him an initial recommendation from the department. The department advised her that normally she could contact law enforcement, but that in this case, Walter said Elfrink was told, &quot;the local police are probably not going to help you.&quot; Elfrink&#039;s husband Wayne was contacted Thursday afternoon at their home. He said what happened to their dog was &quot;a sad situation.&quot; Several city council members reached by the Southeast Missourian declined to comment.

While King says he did not witness the shooting, a neighbor told him that he saw the dog approach the cop and then immediately fall to the ground upon being shot. &quot;My neighbor told me it happened so quick that he was speechless,&quot; said King, who was down the block when Boomer was shot. &quot;He said that he didn&#039;t think you could even pull your firearm out and discharge it that fast.&quot; Repeated calls to Clayton County Police Lt. Tina Daniel were not returned, but Daniel told ABC News&#039; Atlanta affiliate WSB that the officer, who has not been named, was approached by Boomer, who &quot;began barking and running&quot; toward him. Daniel told WSB that the officer commanded the dog to stop but it did not, leading him to shoot and kill him.\r\nAsked whether the officer might have been afraid Boomer was going to bite, King said, &quot;Never once in seven years has Boomer bitten anyone, and I have hundreds of people who can testify.&quot; Holding back tears, King told ABC News that seven-year-old Boomer had given his family a &quot;sense of security&quot; since their father died of cancer eight years ago.

But before the officer got to the door, he shot and killed the family pet. At the quiet country home east of Goshen, you can seldom hear anything but the wind blowing through the trees. But that peace and quiet was shattered by the bullet from the gun of an Elkhart County sheriff&#039;s deputy. The aftermath was caught on a cellphone video. You can hear a friend of the dog owner asking why the dog was shot and the police officer replying that the dog had attacked him. The officer then asks if he should leave and the homeowner tells him yes. &quot;It&#039;s a family member and to just see something like that is something you&#039;re just not going to forget,&quot; said the owner of the dog, Josh Bender, &quot;My dog&#039;s name was Charlie. He was a red heeler lab mix dog. He was a pretty cool little guy. He loved to play fetch. He was always playing fetch, always.&quot; Bender watched as Charlie died from a gunshot. Only minutes earlier he was sitting down to eat lunch when he heard his two dogs barking in his driveway. His wife told him a police officer was pulling up. But before Josh could walk outside, Charlie had been shot. &quot;I was just getting ready to come out the door and I heard a pop,&quot; Bender said, &quot;I looked out the door and saw my dog flailing around here with blood everywhere and a police officer standing there with a look on his face like &#039;what did I do?&#039;&quot; The Benders live about a quarter mile off of CR 36 and the officer, Mike Daly, had to drive the entire way down their driveway to their house. According to the Elkhart County Sheriff&#039;s Department, Daly had first observed the dogs to be friendly, but shortly after they became aggressive. As he tried to back up to his car, he claims one of the dogs charged &ndash; that&#039;s when he shot it.

It has been nearly a week since an Elkhart County sheriff&#039;s deputy shot and killed someone&#039;s dog. After an investigation, the department is sticking by the officer&#039;s actions. On Saturday the officer went to a home in the 16400 block of CR 36 to investigate a traffic incident that had occurred earlier in the day. Police say the officer was attacked by that dog while he was doing his job. The dog&#039;s owner says his dog just wanted to play.

He said he decided to speed up to put some distance between his leashed dogs and the retriever. That&#039;s when he noticed Officer Slobodan Juric walking toward him. Juric was in the area responding to a complaint about a suspicious person, according to police reports. Clark said Juric was yelling, trying to find two kids who were allegedly casing cars. &quot;He was real Joe Macho,&quot; Clark said of Juric. Then Clark heard Missy and the unleashed dog growling at each other. By the time he turned to look, Quincy&#039;s leash had wrapped around him. He fell and the dogs started fighting. Clark said he was grabbing his dogs&#039; collars, trying to pull them away, when Juric yelled &quot;mad dog&quot; and pointed the gun at Missy. Clark said the gun was 3 inches from his ear when Juric fired one shot into the dog. Then the officer pointed the gun at Quincy and fired another round, Clark said. Then two more into Missy. Clark said he was in shock and started yelling at the officer, who still had his gun out. &quot;What the hell did you do that for?&quot; Clark said he yelled. &quot;You curse at me one more time and I&#039;m going to arrest you,&quot; Clark remembers Juric saying. The St. Petersburg Police Department declined to comment on the specifics of Clark&#039;s allegations, said spokesman Mike Puetz. &quot;We&#039;ve begun an internal affairs investigation,&quot; he said. &quot;There will be a statement taken from (Clark) and from everybody who was a witness in the case, to try and discern the totality of the events and the appropriateness of the (officer&#039;s) action.&quot; Juric, 25, has been with the department for more than a year.

Feichter, her husband, and their two sons were visiting family in North Carolina when the shooting happened in the backyard of their Howard Street home. Feichter, 33, who runs a philanthropic consulting firm, said she can&rsquo;t believe the officer had no choice but to shoot Ciarra. &ldquo;He could have said &lsquo;Stop!&rsquo;, he could have said &lsquo;Wait!&rsquo;, he could have pulled out Mace, he could have just stepped behind our garden fence, he could have fired into the ground,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Ciarra would have taken off and sat shivering in a corner. She&rsquo;s very timid.&rdquo; It was about 9 a.m. Saturday when the family got a call from the alarm company saying the alarm was going off. They couldn&rsquo;t immediately reach their house sitter, who had gone out for breakfast, so they called 911. Soon they reached the sitter, Hilary Stewart, who returned to find the front and back doors locked. Apparently, it was a false alarm. &ldquo;The officer pulled up at that moment, so I said, &lsquo;Let me talk to him,&rsquo;&rdquo; Feichter said. &ldquo;We spent a few moments joking because he was the officer who had come out when our cars got broken into six months ago.

She walks back over to Peeples and does it again. She&rsquo;s got sparkly purple polish on her nails. Two days earlier, Peeples&rsquo; dog Egypt, also an American Staffordshire Terrier, was shot by San Diego police officers who say the dog came at them in a threatening manner. Egypt was hit three times&mdash;in the paw, lower leg and shoulder&mdash;and less than an hour later, she was euthanized by San Diego County Animal Control officers, who say Peeples gave them permission to put Egypt down. Peeples said he did no such thing. &ldquo;I told them over and over, &lsquo;Do not euthanize my dog,&rsquo;&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty sure she knows&rdquo; about Egypt&rsquo;s death, Meyer said, commenting on Mali&rsquo;s behavior toward Peeples.\r\nUsually lumped in with Pit Bull Terriers, American Staffordshire Terriers, or AmStaffs, have a reputation not as fighters but as loyal family pets. Peeples said he never had any problems with Egypt, except a complaint from a neighbor that she barked too loud. Egypt loved to play with Peeples&rsquo; 7-year-old son and 6-year-old nephew and would sit at the edge of Peeples&rsquo; front yard, waiting for neighbors to come over to give her treats. Like her dog pal Mali, she often had polish on her nails&mdash;Meyer&rsquo;s mom&rsquo;s idea&mdash;and a matching collar. She didn&rsquo;t so much like the manicures, but after they were over, &ldquo;she&rsquo;d run around with a little pep in her step,&rdquo; Peeples said. &ldquo;She was the delightful nuisance of the neighborhood,&rdquo; said Chris Victor, who lives across the street from Peeples. &ldquo;She&rsquo;d see you and she&rsquo;d wag from head to toe.&rdquo; But for all their friendliness, AmStaffs are inclined to protect their owners and property, which could be the reason Egypt went running toward the cops. Around noon on Tuesday, Dec. 2, Peeples was watching TV at home when he heard a knock at the front door. When he looked out the door&rsquo;s top window, he saw a group of men standing on his porch wearing jeans and T-shirts, a couple of them looking a little ratty. To get a better look, he went to a side window and peeked through the drawn blinds. &ldquo;Honestly, they looked like they were transients,&rdquo; he said. The men, it ends up, were undercover narcotics officers who were there on a complaint about drug activity at that address&mdash;Peeples was later told that it had to do with a &ldquo;chemical smell.&rdquo; Peeples said the men&mdash;he estimates there were six&mdash;never announced who they were. He decided not to open the door and watched as two broke off from the group and walked up the driveway that runs alongside the one-story bungalow he shares with his mom. The men opened a gate leading to the backyard and walked up to the back door. They started knocking and yelling &ldquo;Hello?&rdquo; through the locked security door, Peeples recalled. Peeples was standing in the doorway of a front bedroom where he could see the men but they couldn&rsquo;t see him. &ldquo;It looked like they were trying to case my house,&rdquo; Peeples said. Egypt ran to the security door and started to bark at the strangers. Eventually the two men left the back door and returned to the front of the house. Peeples opened the back door to take a look around; when he did, Egypt ran out. Normally, she&rsquo;d stop at the backyard gate, he said, but the men had left the gate&rsquo;s door open. With nothing to stop her, Egypt went running down the driveway and Peeples went after her. He heard gunshots and saw two men with guns drawn. Wounded, Egypt ran to the backyard. The men pulled out their badges, told Peeples they were undercover narcotics agents, handcuffed him and told him he was being charged with assault with a deadly weapon. A police cruiser pulled up, and Peeples was stuffed in the back. &ldquo;Charge him with everything you can charge him with,&rdquo; he remembers one of the officers saying. San Diego Police Department spokesperson Monica Mu&ntilde;oz confirmed that Egypt didn&rsquo;t attack the officers, but she said they were within policy to shoot her. &ldquo;The animal was charging the officers,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They weren&rsquo;t going to wait to see if [she] was actually going to bite them.&rdquo; Mu&ntilde;oz disputed Peeples&rsquo; claim that there were six officers, saying that narcotics officers work in teams of four. As to their attire&mdash;Peeples said he would have opened the door immediately and kept Egypt at bay if he saw a uniformed officer at his door&mdash;Mu&ntilde;oz said that&rsquo;s not the way narcotics officers operate. &ldquo;Narcotics teams work undercover, work in plainclothes,&rdquo; she said. She referred to what they were doing as a &ldquo;knock-and-talk&rdquo; and confirmed that officers didn&rsquo;t have a search warrant. &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t do any surveillance&hellip;. They went out to check out the complaint.&rdquo; Mike Marrinan, a San Diego attorney who specializes in police use-of-force cases, questioned the officers&rsquo; decisions, starting with having two undercover cops enter an enclosed backyard. &ldquo;People have an expectation of privacy in their backyard that they might not have in their front,&rdquo; Marrinan said. And, obviously, leaving the gate open was a mistake, Marrinan noted. Peeples told CityBeat that if the officers had closed the gate, Egypt would never have run out. Even more troubling, Marrinan said, is the fact that officers were so quick to draw their weapons in a residential area. Meyer, Peeples&rsquo; neighbor, said he heard five shots. According to a police dispatch log, a 911 call reported four or five shots. &ldquo;Bullets can ricochet,&rdquo; Marrinan said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got one relatively small dog, and we&rsquo;re shooting our guns five times?&rdquo; Handcuffed and in the back of the police cruiser, Peeples watched as an animal-control officer led Egypt, covered in blood, out from the backyard. From the trail of blood she left behind, Peeples later determined that Egypt had run up to the back door and then took refuge under some shrubs. Peeple&rsquo;s was approached by an animal-control officer who asked for permission to put Egypt to sleep, telling him it was the humane thing to do. Animal Control spokesperson Dan DeSousa said Peeples&rsquo; verbal authorization to euthanize Egypt was witnessed by a second officer, but Peeples insists he never gave permission. &ldquo;Do not kill my dog; do everything you can to save my dog,&rdquo; he remembers yelling. When he saw Chris Victor, his neighbor, he asked him to make sure Egypt was kept alive. Victor said he called animal control to let them know he&rsquo;d cover any cost for Egypt&rsquo;s care, but by the time his call got through, Egypt had been euthanized. DeSousa said the dog was put down immediately after arriving. Though the assault charge against Peeples was dropped, Mu&ntilde;oz said police have filed misdemeanor charges against him with the San Diego City Attorney&rsquo;s office, including not having a dog license, endangering the public&rsquo;s safety and possession of marijuana. A search of Peeples&rsquo; garage, OK&rsquo;d by his mom, turned up a scale and a tiny amount of marijuana so old that it disintegrated upon contact. Peeples went to pick up Egypt from animal control last Thursday. Victor and Meyer went with him. She was handed over in a clear plastic bag. &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t know she was a sweetheart,&rdquo; Victor said. &ldquo;Had they said &lsquo;sit,&rsquo; she would have sat.&rdquo;','http://www.sdcitybeat.com/sandiego/article-6073-do-everything-you-can-to-save-my-dog.html','Egypt','Unknown Undercover Police (six)','1','0',0,0,0,1,1,'Plain Clothes',0,2,0,0,2,0),(733,'2009-01-27','Florida','Saint Petersburg','Pinellas County Sheriff&#039;s Department',1,50,1,'Chow and Pit Bull mix 9yo','A Pinellas County sheriff&#039;s deputy knocked on Lee Ann Hutts&#039; door Tuesday night and her dog, Smoke, started barking incessantly. Within moments, the deputy pulled out a gun and shot Smoke in the head. That&#039;s about all Hutts and the deputy agree on. The deputy says Smoke attacked him, and he shot in self-defense. Hutts said Smoke was barking, but never attacked the deputy. An eyewitness backs Hutts&#039; account. Smoke died the next day. The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals is investigating. &quot;We have a call in to (the deputy&#039;s) supervisor,&quot; said Connie Brooks, a local SPCA investigator. &quot;You know, sometimes they see things a little differently.&quot; Hutts, 32, and her neighbor Tina Morrow said deputies came to their mobile home park on 28th Street N investigating a burglary report. Unable to find the right home, a deputy went to Hutts&#039; door. Hutts, who takes care of a disabled sister-in-law and lives with her fiance and roommate in her mobile home, said her 9-year-old chow-pit bull mix was barking when she opened the door but stopped when she told him to be quiet. She tried to put him in another room but he followed her out. Smoke kept barking but never left her side, she said. The deputy was agitated, she said, and kicked her dog. Then he shot him. &quot;I damn near passed out,&quot; Hutts said. &quot;I had blood all over me, I was screaming.&quot; The deputy left, she said. Pinellas sheriff&#039;s spokeswoman Marianne Pasha offered a different account based on an incident report from Sgt. Robert McGuire and a supplemental report from a backup deputy. McGuire, a 24-year veteran, wrote that when he knocked on Hutts&#039; door he could hear a dog barking. When Hutts answered, he asked her to secure the dog. The dog appeared to charge him, so he shooed the dog with his foot. &quot;He believed the dog was going to bite him,&quot; Pasha said, so he shot him in the head. The deputy was unaware that Smoke died. Pasha asked a reporter how the dog was doing and was told he had died. Hutts said she and her sister-in-law took the wounded Smoke to Noah&#039;s Place 24-Hour Animal Medical Center on 62nd Avenue N. Unable to afford the $3,000 she was told surgery would cost, Hutts left with a prescription for pain medication. She took the dog home and stayed up all night with him. Smoke died in the morning. Cathy Miktuk, the property manager at the mobile home park, Suncove Apartments, said the entire neighborhood is upset. Everyone loved Smoke, who barks a lot but was never aggressive, she said. &quot;We&#039;ve all got dogs, and a lot of us watched what happened,&quot; Miktuk said. &quot;Why didn&#039;t they just mace that dog?&quot; Miktuk called the SPCA Tuesday morning and helped gather statements from witnesses. The SPCA&#039;s Brooks said it routinely investigates when law enforcement shoots a dog. &quot;We&#039;d like to talk to the officer, because it&#039;s a complaint like any other complaint,&quot; she said. &quot;But we realize officers are out there protecting people.&quot; Hutts&#039; neighbor who watched the shooting is angry that the Sheriff&#039;s Office didn&#039;t check on how the dog or Hutts were doing. &quot;This was her family pet,&quot; Morrow said. &quot;He was a total sweetheart. There&#039;s a gazillion cats around here, and they&#039;re not even scared of him.&quot; The deputies never found the caller who reported the initial incident, Pasha said.','http://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/pinellas-deputy-owner-differ-on-why-he-shot-chow-pit-bull-mix/971611','Smoke','Robert McGuire','0','0',0,0,0,0,0,'Uniform',0,2,0,0,2,0),(734,'2009-02-07','Nevada','Las Vegas','Las Vegas Police Department',1,50,1,'Pit Bull 6yo','&quot;Coco&quot; was a good dog. Almost embarrassingly so. When Jose Fernandez would have friends over, he would brag that he had a pit bull. He&#039;d take his friends into the backyard to see Coco and the 6-year-old pit bull would lick their feet. &quot;I&#039;d say, &#039;Come on! Put on a mean face or something!&#039;&quot; Fernandez, 40, said. But that&#039;s all Coco would do, he said. Lick them, or put his paw on their laps for attention. Around 5 a.m. Friday, Coco was shot and killed in his backyard by a Las Vegas police officer.\r\nThe officer was one of several who were searching for a DUI suspect who fled on foot from a traffic stop near Nellis Boulevard and Sahara Avenue, according to department spokesman Bill Cassell. Police searched a nearby neighborhood with a helicopter equipped with a heat detecting device and spotted a large mass in a shed behind a home at 4880 Welter Ave., Cassell said. Cassell said the dog, which was inside the shed, confronted officers. But he said he didn&#039;t know how the dog displayed aggressiveness. &quot;The officer did everything he could to avoid shooting at the dog. Ultimately he was forced to fire in self-defense,&quot; Cassell said. Two shots rang out. Coco had a bullet wound in his back and in his chest, according to Fernandez and his girlfriend, Yurisel De La Torre. Both were at work at the time. The suspect, whose name and charges were not released, was arrested a few doors away. Cassell said the dog&#039;s death was a mistake and the department offered apologies to the family. &quot;This is an extra unfortunate incident,&quot; he said. &quot;All cops are animal lovers and it hurts us deeply when something like this occurs.&quot; A next-door neighbor said she never heard Coco bark or growl at the officers. Sandra Orozco, 27, said she was awakened by seven police officers in her backyard around 4:30 a.m. The officers then jumped the wall between the two yards, she said.\r\nOrozco couldn&#039;t see the shooting while standing in her patio because the wall blocked her view, but she and her parents did hear two pops that she later learned were the fatal shots. She said Coco was &quot;always gentle&quot; and played well with her 5-year-old daughter. De La Torre, teary-eyed and surrounded by photos of the dog, said that was one of the reasons she adopted Coco. She remembers first seeing him at the Lied Animal Shelter three years ago. While other dogs barked and jumped for attention, Coco didn&#039;t make a sound. &quot;Coco just put his head right next to the door, looking for attention,&quot; she said. Coco let De La Torre&#039;s four Chihuahuas jump on him and bite his tail. When one of them became too rough, he gently nudged them with his paw. With her 6-month-old daughter, Coco would set his face in her lap and she would pull on his ears. Coco didn&#039;t mind, De La Torre said. He was just happy for the attention. De La Torre and Fernandez don&#039;t believe Coco could have harmed the officer and are upset that the officers didn&#039;t ask before entering their backyard. They also don&#039;t believe catching the suspect was worth jumping into their backyard and killing their dog. &quot;I don&#039;t think it&#039;s right,&quot; De La Torre said. &quot;It wasn&#039;t like he was a killer.&quot; Las Vegas police do not have official procedures for dealing with dogs because each encounter is different, Cassell said. Officers are just instructed to balance the risk to themselves and the public in such incidents. They&#039;ve been involved in other similar shootings. In 2005, while chasing a graffiti vandal, two Las Vegas police officers shot and killed one pit bull and wounded another that they encountered in the dog owner&#039;s fenced yard. Police said the animals chased the officers. In 2004, while responding to a burglary call, an officer jumped into a backyard and shot and killed a blue heeler-dingo mix that police said &quot;charged aggressively&quot; at the officer. In both of those cases the department either paid veterinary bills or offered to pay cremation costs. They haven&#039;t done either in Friday&#039;s incident, according to Fernandez and De La Torre. While clutching Coco&#039;s blood-stained collar, Fernandez showed a receipt of $225.45 they had to pay to a nearby veterinarian to have him cremated after police took the dog to the clinic. &quot;He wasn&#039;t a dog. He was family,&quot; Fernandez said.','http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/familys-pet-coco-killed-police','Coco','Seven Unknown Police','1','0',1,0,0,0,0,'Uniform',0,2,0,0,2,0),(735,'2014-05-12','Florida','Orlando','Orlando Police Department',1,2,1,'Unconfirmed','The following is based entirely on police statements: Officials said an Orlando police officer was forced to shoot a dog after he was bitten on Monday.

Tyree, 37, said she heard two pit bull dogs bark at her in the predawn darkness. She said she turned and saw the dogs standing in the middle of the street in the 3300 block of S.E. Colfax. In short order, Tyree said, the dogs charged at her. A short time later, a Topeka police officer fired two rounds, both of which struck and killed one of the &ldquo;vicious&rdquo; pitbulls. But before that happened, Tyree had to take quick action to keep herself and her baby safe. As the pair of dogs began to charge at her, Tyree said, &ldquo;I told them to go home. I guess that made them mad.&rdquo; Holding her 5-month-old son, Christian, in her left arm, away from the dogs, Tyree jumped on the hood of her car, parked in a driveway on the east side of S.E. Colfax. She used her feet to kick at the dogs as they tried to jump on top of her car, she said. Just then, a neighbor across the street saw what was happening and yelled out &ldquo;Go home&rdquo; at the dogs, who then turned and headed north on S.E. Colfax toward the man&rsquo;s house. Tyree said a police car arrived on the scene about the same time. She said the officer got out of his patrol car and was charged by the dogs. The officer, Tyree said, swung his baton back and forth three times, backing up in the process, before using his gun to shoot one of the dogs two times. The dog died at the scene. The other dog, meanwhile, took off running and police hadn&rsquo;t located it by 9 a.m. &ldquo;The officer didn&rsquo;t want to shoot the dog,&rdquo; Tyree said. &ldquo;It was his last resort.&rdquo; Cpl. Louis Cortez said at the scene that police had been notified of the pair of pit bull dogs running at large in the neighborhood, charging at people and preventing children from going to their school bus stop. At least two additional residents on the block were forced to seek safety on top of their cars when they were charged by the dogs, Cortez said. While police don&rsquo;t want to be forced to shoot dogs, Cortez said, cases such as Monday&rsquo;s incident leave officers no choice but to do so. He said the incident was the result of the dogs&rsquo; owners not taking responsibility and keeping the animals secured.\r\nCortez held four pieces of paper that had witness reports of the incident, all agreeing on the facts of the situation and stating the officer took &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; action. Animal control officials picked up the deceased dog, who died near the west curb in the 3300 block of S.E. Colfax.

Of interest is the fact that police and media claim the dog was a &quot;120 pound pit bull&quot; despite the fact that male pit bulls weigh between 35 and 66 pounds. Flint police try to avoid lethal force with dogs whenever possible, but after a Taser didn&#039;t stop a 120 pound pit bull from attacking a 14-year-old boy in late June, they say they were left with no choice. Flint City Councilman Bryant Nolden said the incident happened on Sunday, June 22, while more than 1,000 people were at the Berston Field House for a weekly softball game. The Third Ward councilman said he is the volunteer director at Berston, so he unlocks the facility for the community to use from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. during the games on Sundays. Nolden said during the softball game, he saw a teenage girl walking the pit bull around the baseball diamond area. Nolden said the girl was having trouble controlling the large, leashed dog and he told her she should not have the animal in such a large crowd of people. &quot;She could not handle the dog. It was obvious, because the dog was pulling her all over the place, and a few folks, including myself, said, &#039;You really shouldn&#039;t have this dog down here. Especially with this many folks down here.&#039;&quot; Nolden said. Flint police and Michigan State Police were already at Berston to aid in traffic control after the softball game. Nolden said he requested a police presence after a number of teenagers began coming to the facility and fights broke out. &quot;We&#039;ve had problems with teenagers using social media to settle neighborhood beefs and we had a couple of incidents where we had girls down there fighting,&quot; Nolden said. &quot;That&#039;s why we were requesting the police presence, because of the sheer numbers and the amount of young folks from 13 to maybe 18 that are coming down. And they aren&#039;t coming down for the games, they are down here to start problems.&quot; According to a Flint police report, officers were conducting crowd control for the spectators when the dog broke loose from its leash and charged a 14-year-old boy. Officers first attempted to use a Taser on the dog during the attack, but the animal was unaffected. The dog then turned and charged toward the officer, who shot two bullets at the dog. According to the report, the dog continued, charging at a second officer who fired another two rounds, paralyzing the animal. Flint Police Chief James Tolbert said officers had to use deadly force on the animal after the Taser failed to work on the dog, because it posed a threat to the crowd after attacking the 14-year-old boy. Tolbert said the officers did not want to shoot the dog again because of the large crowd. Genesee County Animal Control came to the scene and took possession of the injured dog with the owner&#039;s consent. Chief Animal Control Officer Stephani Lazar said the center euthanized the dog. Lazar said some breeds of dog are just too much for some people to handle if they don&#039;t take the time to train them and keep them in safe and healthy situations.\r\n&quot;It&#039;s unfortunate. A lot of people buy these large-breed dogs with dominant personalities and they don&#039;t get them neutered and they don&#039;t train them properly and then they get put into situations where they can&#039;t handle these animals and then a person or another animal gets hurt,&quot; Lazar said. &quot;So these animals are set up to fail, and in the meantime not only do they fail, but they hurt somebody else.&quot; Lazar said some dog owners expect all breeds to have the same personality, but said that is not the case. She said the best thing a dog owner can do is to research their breed, get them spayed or neutered, and into an obedience class. Nolden said he is an avid animal lover, but believes the officers did what they had to in order to protect the crowd. &quot;I&#039;m a dog lover and I&#039;m on the Genesee County Animal Control Sub-Committee and I&#039;m really passionate about animals and their rights, but this dog was just really, really big and I do not fault the police officer for protecting the community,&quot; Nolden said. &quot;I could not have held that dog, it was that big.&quot;\r\nThe 14-year-old boy who was attacked suffered minor injuries and was taken to Hurley Medical Center for treatment, police said.

Police said the dog barked, lunged at the first officer and bit his handgun after the officer responded to a complaint in the 1900 block of West Bergan Street just after 5 p.m. Thursday. The attack reportedly came after police tried for several minutes to keep the pit bull at bay with a yard rake and lure it back to its owner&#039;s house with some food. &quot;It was just time to keep somebody from getting hurt,&quot; Capt. Phil Trent said.\r\nTrent said an officer first went to 1901 W. Bergan to help a 13-year-old boy and a 16-year-old boy who said the dog had them trapped in a car. As the officer approached, the dog ran behind a neighboring house. A few moments later, while the officer was asking a neighbor about the dog, it ran toward the officer and lunged at him. Because the neighbor said the dog might live at 1911 W. Bergan, the officer lured it to the backyard with some food. But as soon as the food was gone, the dog again lunged toward the officer. The officer drew his handgun and pointed it at the dog, which backed away for a moment but then jumped at the officer and clamped its teeth onto his gun, Trent said. After the officer pulled his gun away from the pit bull, the dog appeared to gather itself for another jump, and another officer who had arrived drew his .40-caliber handgun and fatally shot the dog.\r\nSouth Bend Animal Care and Control officers soon arrived and took the dog away. Police were not able to find the dog&#039;s owners or determine for sure if it lived at 1911 W. Bergan. In a 8-0 vote, the Common Council voted May 29 to adopt new pet regulations that will take effect Aug. 1. The new ordinance strikes previous language that singled out American pit bulls as dangerous and required pit bull owners to pay $75 for a special license. The new regulations put a greater focus on dogs of any breed that repeatedly display aggressive tendencies, and the revised ordinance strengthens some rules that apply to all dogs, such as a provision that prohibits any dog from being kept outside on a chain.','http://www.southbendtribune.com/news/crime/south-bend-police-officer-kills-pit-bull/article_f365f9b6-eda0-11e3-96cf-0017a43b2370.html','Unknown Pit Bull','Two Unknown Police','1','0',1,0,0,2,2,'Uniform',3,3,0,0,0,0),(749,'2014-06-08','Ohio','Cincinnati','Cincinnati Police Department',1,2,1,'Unconfirmed','Cincinnati police shot and killed a pit bull Sunday night after it lunged at them.

Note that the police shot the dog at the scene of a fire that destroyed the dog owner&#039;s home. The dog was in the owner&#039;s car while the fire burned. The dog jumped through the car window to allegly attack the police. The police used the opportunity to perform a warrantless search of the car where they discovered a small amount of marijuana, leading to a criminal charge for the owner. Two West Manheim Township Police officers, including the chief, were bitten by a dog while at the scene of a house fire in the township Monday morning. Chief Tim Hippensteel, who suffered injuries in the attack, was forced to shoot the pit bull, police said. It is expected to survive. Fellow police officer Sgt. Toby Wildasin was also injured when the dog belonging to a tenant of the burned home leapt from a car and attacked them. Both officers were treated at the scene for their injuries. The dog&#039;s owner, Christopher Adam Weibe, 20, of 31 Rickey Drive, is in York County Prison on $2,500 bail, stemming from the attack and drug charges, police say. Hippensteel was sent to the home about 11:20 a.m. for the fire and, once there, went into the burning house to search for anyone inside but was forced out by heavy smoke and flames, police said. Weibe and another person were asleep in the basement but heard Hippensteel&#039;s shouts about the fire and, with the pit bull, got out via a basement door.\r\nPolice say Weibe became argumentative and uncooperative when officers told him he had to secure the dog. Weibe put the dog in his car, which is missing a passenger-door window, police said. The dog jumped through the window and attacked Wildasin, biting his inner thigh and groin area, causing minor injuries, police said. Weibe regained control of the dog and put it back in the car. But it didn&#039;t stay there for long. It again jumped through the window, this time attacking Hippensteel and biting his right calf, police said. Hippensteel shot the dog once with his handgun. It was at that point that, police say, Weibe also got out of the car and shoved Hippensteel to the ground. Weibe ran away but was arrested a short time later when he returned to the scene. The dog was found nearby and was taken to a veterinarian for treatment, police said. Charges: Officers found marijuana, which Weibe took from the home when he fled the flames, in Weibe&#039;s car, police allege. They also found drug paraphernalia inside the home, police said. Weibe was taken to the county&#039;s central booking unit, where he was arraigned. He is charged with aggravated assault on a police officer, simple assault, resisting arrest, reckless endangerment, harassment, possession of marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia, police said. It&#039;s not known if he has retained an attorney. Police have asked the York County District Attorney&#039;s detective bureau to investigate the shooting to see if department regulations and state law were followed. The fire: Pleasant Hill Volunteer Community Fire Co. Chief Ted Clousher said the blaze started in an attached garage and spread to the house. Crews had the fire under control in 25 to 30 minutes, the chief said. Weibe and the other resident weren&#039;t initally aware if anyone else was inside the home. That caused firefighters to search the house twice. No one else was found inside, Clousher said. All told, five adults and three children were displaced, according to the local Red Cross, who is assisting them with food, clothing and a place to stay. A state police fire marshal is investigating its cause, Clousher said, adding it caused $125,000 in damage. The house is owned by a member of the armed forces who is serving aboard. He is renting the house and the residents do not have renters&#039; insurance, Clousher said.

At one point, she opened the front door to go back outside to see what was going on, and the dog forced its way past her and attacked the officer. She told NBC 10 that the dog has never before exhibited this type of violent behavior, but thinks he acted this way to protect his owner.

It all started at about four in the morning in July, 2009. Tallahassee Police Officers Joseph Azevedo and Mark Adrick arrived at a home in the 1400 block of Charlotte Avenue. The officers were there because Kyle Marshall&#039;s live in girlfriend for two years claimed he was going to harm her black lab Dutch and wouldn&#039;t return it. Marshall says it&#039;s not true and fallout from a fight. The officers claim Marshall ordered his dog Smitty to attack them.\r\nOfficer Azevedo fatally shot Smitty. &quot;The officers maintain that the dog attacked them and they were justified in using the force they used,&quot; said Cassandra Jackson, a spokeswoman for the Tallahassee City Attorney.\r\n&quot;In no way was Smitty aggressive,&quot; said Marshall. &quot;In no way did he look aggressive,&quot; he said. &quot;This was basically the officers not manning up to a mistake they made and covering themselves to keep their jobs,&quot; Marshall said.\r\nWhile Marshall admits he was rude to the officers and told them to leave his property multiple times, he says he feared for his own life after Officer Azevedo shot Smitty. He says he tried to close the door and get away, but the officers entered his home and Acevedo shot Marshall twice with a taser. &quot;They shot my dog right on my front porch and then came into my house,&quot; said Marshall. &quot;What rights do you have if you can&#039;t stay in your own house,&quot; he said. &quot;It was determined their actions were completely justified because they were in fear for their own safety,&quot; said Jackson. Marshall was arrested and charged with two counts of aggravated assault on a law enforcement officer, resisting an officer without violence and petit theft of the dog. He faced up to 30 years in prison. However, the state attorney dropped all the charges, noting &quot;the dog in this case does not meet the definition of a deadly weapon&quot;.\r\nMarshall then sued. Instead of going to trial, the city settled out of court with Marshall for $25,000. &quot;There was some concern perhaps the sympathy factor because of the dog,&quot; said Jackson explaining the decision to settle.\r\nWhile Marshall has received the $25,000 settlement, he says his legal bills were more than $40,000. And he said he sat in jail for two weeks. He says he was offered a plea deal for three years in prison he&#039;s glad he didn&#039;t take. &quot;It&#039;s real serious,&quot; said Marshall. &quot;It would&#039;ve changed my entire life,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#039;d still be in jail right now,&quot; Marshall said.

However, the Phenix City Police Department says the dog made an aggressive move at the officer. Assistant Police Chief Robert Casteel says his officer was helping U.S. Marshals look for an escapee from Georgia. He says an informant told them the suspect would be at the Dillingham Street house. When they got there, Casteel says there were some people sitting in the back, including Westfall. U.S. Marshals approached them while he says his officer went to check on a shed that music was coming from. Casteel says U.S. Marshals asked Westfall to restrain his dog. \r\n&quot;Mr. Westfall was asked to take control of his dog and declined, and when the officer walked around from behind the car the dog made an aggressive movement toward him, baring his teeth and the officer fired one shot,&quot; says Casteel. Westfall tells a different story. He says his dog barked at the marshals and officer when they first arrived, but then calmed down once Westfall told the dog to be quiet. He tells News 3 the officer went into his shed to look around, and when he came out the dog barked twice. Westfall says the officer then pulled out his gun and shot the dog in the head from about 10-15 feet away.\r\n&quot;At first I thought it was a taser gun or something and then I looked at my dog and my dog&#039;s brains were hanging out. My dog&#039;s sitting there, he&#039;s panting- he lasted about 10 minutes before he died,&quot; says Westfall. &quot;Mr. Westfall may have been under that impression that the dog would be fine,&quot; said Casteel. &quot;But police officers get different reactions from dogs from other people because dogs can sense an apprehension whenever they arrive on the scene, and some dogs that won&rsquo;t bite anybody else will bite a police officer or people in uniform because they sense that apprehension.&quot; Westfall said his dog, a boxer, did not attack the officer and has never been an aggressive dog. &ldquo;My dog lives here, this is my dog&#039;s house.

The following is the statement of the owner of the victim, who was handcuffed and forced to kneel in the desert while the police killed her dog: \r\n\r\n&quot;On July 4th I was driving alone with my service dog of almost 8 years of age, Dunkin&rsquo;, in the rear seat towards the middle. I was pulled over on I-17 after being tailed for about one mile. The cop was very close to the rental car I was driving which was a gray Toyota corolla. The vehicle was due back on Sunday and I had planned on returning it, then utilizing the airport shuttle to catch my early flight back to New York&rsquo;s La Guardia airport with Dunkin as my travel companion. I pulled over to a safe spot on the shoulder of the road and the cop opened the door and drew out a shot gun. He actually AIMED it at me. I could see his eye aiming and it made no sense. I was shouted at and told to keep my hands where he can see them. This seemed very strange and not at all common for being pulled over. I could hear shot gun cocked and I realized that something was not right. I obeyed his shouts to keep my hands up and I allowed Dunkin to continue sleeping in order to keep us both calm. I was ordered to get out of the car, walk backwards without looking, and was very confused&hellip; I was going further and further away from Dunkin&rsquo;. I was shouted at to kneel, yelled at and then immediately cuffed and put in the back seat of a cop car. I immediately told him that my service animal is in the back of the car and to please be careful with him as he is license in NY state and is official for my Multiple Sclerosis. The car was overwhelmingly hot and my MS symptoms began as I tried breathing for fresh air. It was getting hotter and now he was drawing a weapon to the vehicle. I was very frightened that they would kill Dunkin&rsquo; as they looked like they would do so with the weapons drawn so intently. The cop opened the rental car door which was nearest the I-17 traffic. Dunkin&rsquo; rested soundly on that side of the vehicle. When the door was opened, the cop let him get out of the car onto oncoming traffic. Dunkin&rsquo; got out of the vehicle confused. He ran into oncoming traffic, looking for me. His mission is to look for me, wherever I may be. As cars swerved and missed him&hellip; I screamed. I prayed and screamed at the top of my lungs for my companion&rsquo;s safety. The cop S.D Soto (who was the one who aimed at me through his shotgun, also cuffed me) walked to the front of the car passenger area. He pulled out Dunkin&rsquo;s fluorescent orange service vest and read the insert in his pocket which states that he is a service animal and he is protected under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. S.D Soto Read the facts, read my rental agreement (which was located on the passenger seat area) and continued to ignore my pleas for help and air conditioning. At this point a red headed cop was on the scene too, along with a thicker sized blonde-red headed cop. I will never forget their faces. One wore shades, the other had glasses and piercing blue eyes. They completely ignored my existence and did not check on me. Someone chased Dunkin&rsquo; and I told them that he would ONLY come to me. I begged and pleaded to allow them to let me call for him. S.D Soto told me to shut up and I was annoying him. He said that he would gag me next, if I said another word and did not cooperate. I noticed my wrists were really in a lot of pain and my body temperature was rising in the back of the car. Dunkin was nowhere to be seen, he ran off into the area where desert grows. At this point, I hoped coyotes would not get him. I was screaming for them to listen to my pleas and my proof that it was a rental and I do indeed have MS and need my service animal for my well-being. Again, I was shouted at while they walked around calmly with no care for Dunkin or my safety. My safety was compromised the moment they ignored me and Dunkin&rsquo;. They never read me any rights, and continued to walk around, ignoring how hot I was in that car. It felt like a fish out of water and I was gasping for air. Dunkin&rsquo; came back through the desert area to about 10 yards north of the vehicle which obtained me. I screamed again, and begged them to keep him safe. They again chased him, frightened him, and he ran northbound. I never saw my Dunkin&rsquo; again.\r\nAt this point the sergeant&hellip; Robert Hardt, was called to the scene. I was let out of the vehicle, still cuffed very tightly. I am 5 feet tall and weigh 110 lb&rsquo;s. I whistled in vain to call Dunkin&rsquo;.. I was not allowed to walk towards the area he has run towards. I was not allowed to move. I was on the gravel on the side of the road waiting for the cops to do something. I begged the sergeant to lead me, with the cuffs, or however he seemed fit, in order for me to be able to get to Dunkin&rsquo; to whistle for him. He told me not to worry and &ldquo;the dog will come back.&rdquo; A cop car came back with Dunkin&rsquo;s destroyed body in it. I asked an officer&hellip; is there anything left&hellip; the red headed one with the glasses and blue eyes shook his nod, indicating that there was nothing left to see. At that point, I began to mourn. I screamed and I screamed in shock. My hands were still cuffed. I was thirsty, the srgt gave me water from a water bottle he had in his car. Around that point, I was uncuffed. I called my friends and family in NY and AZ and no one answered for what seemed an eternity. I finally reached a friend in NYC and I screamed in agony at the trauma I had just undergone. The srgt called ambulance to see about my MS. They said to me, &ldquo;you cannot scream and cry in my ambulance.&rdquo; I refused treatment since I could not help my emotions of having lost my dearest best friend in this earth. They wanted to sedate me and start and IV on me. I refused this as I did not think I would wake up if I allowed them to stick a needle in me. Already they had violated me. A sheriff&rsquo;s chaplain was then called to the scene. My phone died, and I was able to speak to my brother, who was in Hawaii vacationing, through the srgt&rsquo;s cell phone. My brother was extremely concerned about my MS as he understands the close bond that Dunkin and I have shared for almost 8 years. I was in no condition to drive, I do not know who drove the rental back to the rental location. My belongings were put in a bag, I was put in a car with the chaplain and I continued to document my bruising by photographing my wrists with the time on the dash board. I grieved the entire way to the hospital asking the chaplain for words of consolation and he was speechless. The bruising on my legs from kneeling on the tar/gravel started to emerge when I got back to NYC. I have attached those pictures in a previous email. I was never cited for anything, I was never read any rights, I was not arrested. I ended up in the hospital and was given a sedative. I had x-rays taken of my wrists as the pain was excruciating to the slightest touch. My friend Andrea Barker took Dunkin&rsquo;s remains to the animal crematory where Dunkin&rsquo; was cremated. His remains arrive in New York in a few days.\r\nI have already felt the symptoms of MS which has been in full remission for 4 years. My left hand buzzes and tingles, my capacity to concentrate has diminished and my job is in jeopardy. I am a Master&rsquo;s degree student at NYU and begin a new class tomorrow. I have received 2 A&rsquo;s and 3 B&rsquo;s in the coursework I have achieved and I hold a position of Learning Specialist at the College of Dentistry. I am my sole provider and feel the stresses of this trauma impeding my rest, my work, my concentration, my spirit (which feels broken). I experience nightmares nightly and sever bouts of mourning. My life is not the same.&quot;','http://justicefordunkin.blogspot.com/','Dunkin Dog','S.D Soto, Robert Hardt and Two Unknown Police','0','0',0,0,0,0,2,'Uniform',3,3,2,2,2,0),(779,'2014-03-18','Arizona','Phoenix','Phoenix Police Department',1,50,0,'Labrador Mix','Victim Winter lab mix.

Brittany Chambers was startled early this morning when officers showed up at her side gate after finding her broken down car a few blocks away.\r\nPolice say they wanted to make sure the car hadn&#039;t been stolen. &quot;I Heard the gate kinda jiggle I heard her bark, and then I didn&#039;t hear her bark anymore, just the little one,&quot; said Chambers.

According to police, the officer fired his gun three times toward their dog Winter when they say she became aggressive toward him and began by biting at his legs. &quot;From the time that they knocked on our door to the time they shot the gun couldn&#039;t have been more than 30 seconds,&quot; said neighbor Effie Craven. Craven described what happened next. &quot;I don&#039;t know why they didn&#039;t knock on the gate, or yell over the fence, or come back to our door and ask us to call  them, the first thing that happened was the dog got shot,&quot; said Craven.

When officers got to the scene, the men were standing on top of a car. Padilla was bleeding heavily. Police said one of the dogs charged at them when they were trying to rescue the men, so they shot and killed the dog.

But the family who owns the dog, named &quot;Jack,&quot; disputed the claims made by police. A police report obtained Friday morning revealed new details about the incident. The dog reportedly acted aggressively toward two teenagers, a man and a plain-clothes detective that was driving by before being flagged down. Two teenage girls and a man living in the area told police a black dog had ran aggressively toward each of them around 5:30 p.m., first the girls, then the man, the report states. The girls, who were jogging, had seen a white dog first. They approached what seemed to be a lost and friendly dog, the report states. That&#039;s when, according to the police report, the black dog &quot;came out of nowhere&quot; at them, barking. The girls avoided the dog by climbing on a small rock wall, then the dog turned its attention to the man who was walking to get his mail. The dog was &quot;aggressively barking&quot; at the man, the report states, so he threw keys at the dog to scare it. That man then noticed plain-clothes LCPD detective Rick Garcia pulling into the neighborhood and asked him to call animal control. Garcia, after calling for animal control, said he tried to shoo the black dog away, then corral it into a nearby yard. Neither tactic worked, the report states, so Garcia said he tried to back away. When he did, &quot;the dog lunged at him for a third time,&quot; barking and with teeth bared. That&#039;s when Garcia said he fired two shots, hitting the dog near the head and back. Kelcy Wilcox, whose family owned the approximately 4-year-old dog, adamantly denied that Jack, the mostly black Catahoula mix was aggressive. She said the dog would have reacted the way it did because it was frightened. &quot;He&#039;s not an aggressive dog,&quot; said Wilcox, a New Mexico State University graduate who earned a degree in animal science, and has directly worked with the dog for about 2 1/2 years. &quot;He was extremely well mannered, well trained.&quot; According to a letter Wilcox wrote to the Sun-News, the family took the dog out publicly, to the Las Cruces dog park, Caliche&#039;s, St. Clair&#039;s Winery for Yappy Hour, Andele&#039;s Dog House and High Desert Brewing Co. By the time the animal control officer arrived, the report states, a roommate of the dog&#039;s owner arrived. They tried to look for the white dog, which had fled. The animal control officer reportedly found it in its yard, around the block from where the black dog died. As he approached that yard, a neighbor warned him to beware of the black dog living there because it &quot;was a crazy dog,&quot; according to the report. &quot;All he did was growl,&quot; Wilcox said. &quot;That is a warning and not a reason to shoot him.&quot; The adult man and two teenage girls who the police said were being harassed by the dog were not injured. As per departmental policy related to the duty-related discharge of a firearm, the multi-agency task force will investigate the shooting. The task force includes investigators from New Mexico State Police, the Do&ntilde;a Ana County Sheriff&#039;s Office, New Mexico State University Police and Las Cruces police. The task force reports its findings to the 3rd Judicial District Attorney&#039;s Office.

Dan Trujillo, a spokesman for the Las Cruces Police Department said just before 11 a.m. Monday officers responded to a report of a vicious dog in the 1000 block of Larry Drive. When they arrived they discovered that the dog had bitten or attacked a 79-year-old man who resides near the owners of the canine, said police spokesman Dan Trujillo. According to Trujillo the dog approached the police officer &quot;aggressively.&quot; The dog allegedly pinned the officer against his unit. The officer is believed to have fired at least one round which struck the dog. However, the owners, Marin Serna and his fiancee Sonia Gonzalez said their dog Mac was too small to pin an officer. They said their dog was wrongfully shot and the victim of breed discrimination. Gonzalez said the officer should not have had to use his gun to restrain a 30 pound dog. An Animal Control officer took the dog to a local veterinarian where the dog was pronounced dead. Injuries to the 79-year-old man who was bit or attacked by the dog were non-life-threatening. Investigators are also looking into the possibility that the dog may have attacked someone else earlier in the day. Trujillo said, &quot;Right now the Las Cruces Police Department and our Officer involved Incident Task Force, which is made up of agencies throughout the area, are jointly investigating this shooting.&quot; He said they investigate any officer-related shooting that occurs on duty. The dog did have a history of getting out of the yard but not for being aggressive.  Officials said the owner has been cited two times in the past 12 months for the dog getting out.

News that the department is considering tranquilizer guns, however, brought little consolation to the dead dog&#039;s owner, Harold Mason. Mason is a retired Delaware County 911 dispatch supervisor and currently serves on the Muncie Board of Works, appointed there by Mayor Sharon McShurley. Mason believes that even without tranquilizers, the officers had alternatives to deadly force, including tear gas and Tasers. He criticized the officers for using their guns to break up a dog fight and questioned whether his dog was the victim of breed discrimination. &quot;The only reason they shot my dog is because he is a pit bull,&quot; Mason said. &quot;If you run up on a Chihuahua and poodle and the Chihuahua has got the poodle around the neck, are you going to shoot the Chihuahua? It was a dog fight. Dogs fight.&quot;\r\nHAROLD! you&#039;re a fucktard! if your pit fighter was fighting another pit fighter your idiotic comment would have some credibility. but this situation is the equivalent to an adult beating up a child. Barrett, however, defended the shooting, saying the officers did the best they could in the situation. Barrett was not on the scene but has reviewed corresponding reports. &quot;Based on what I know right now, I would say they did what they should do,&quot; Barrett said. &quot;You have to take all the possibilities into account.&quot; Mason&#039;s dog, a six-year-old brown pit-bull named Bishop, was killed about 11:30 p.m. on July 30. Earlier that evening, Bishop had gotten loose from Mason&#039;s back yard along North Gavin Street, where he kept the dog on a cable, and apparently sauntered over to a neighbor&#039;s house on nearby Lowell Street. &quot;This dog is not a vicious dog,&quot; said Mason, who sort of inherited Bishop from his son. The neighbor had befriended Bishop, Mason said, and her porch had become the pit bull&#039;s home away from home. On this night, however, the neighbor had tied a German shepherd to her front porch, having found it wandering the neighborhood earlier, Mason said. A fight between the dogs ensued and, according to police reports, Bishop sunk his teeth into the German shepherd&#039;s neck. Muncie police officers Kristopher Duncan, Chris Kirby and Shane Finnegan responded to the fight after the neighbor called 911. Kirby said he considered rubbing hand sanitizer into Bishop&#039;s mouth to get it to release, but that the dog was angry and wouldn&#039;t let the officers get close. To save the German shepherd, the officer said, he had to shoot the pit bull. &quot;I&#039;m a dog lover. I hate what happened,&quot; Kirby said. &quot;I hate it. It just breaks my heart. If I had another alternative, I would have used it.&quot; Kirby&#039;s first shot struck Bishop in the side, but according to police reports the dog continued to fight. Kirby and Finnegan fired several more shots before Bishop left the scene, apparently mortally wounded. Kirby tracked him down to a neighboring back yard where he euthanized the dog with a shot to the head. While police reports available to the media did not indicate exactly how many shots were fired, Mason said he heard eight as he ran to the scene of the fight. &quot;That&#039;s what concerns me is to shoot at a dog eight times in a residential area,&quot; Mason said. Mason showed The Star Press a nearby home that had at least four holes in its vinyl siding that appeared to be from gunfire. The neighbors told The Star Press that at least three of the holes were not there before the police shot at the dog. Barrett said police believe one of the holes came from the officers, though the department is not sure whether the bullet ricocheted or struck the house directly. &quot;They weren&#039;t just recklessly firing rounds into the air,&quot; Barrett said. Kirby, who estimated seven shots were fired, said as far as he knew none struck the house. &quot;We were close enough on every shot that every shot went into the dog,&quot; he said. After the chaos died down, animal control came and took away both dogs. Kirby -- who is currently providing foster care for an abandoned pit bull until a rescue group can find her a home -- reported that the German shepherd had lost a lot of blood but appeared as if it would recover. The flip side of this story is that they may have saved the German shepherd&#039;s life,&quot; Barrett said. Mason wasn&#039;t so sure. &quot;All they had to do was wait for me,&quot; he said. &quot;I could have got my dog.&quot; Mason met with Police Chief Deb Davis in the days after the shooting. (Davis referred questions to Barrett). &quot;I&#039;m not trying to get anybody in trouble,&quot; he said. &quot;I just don&#039;t want this to happen to anyone else.&quot; Barrett told The Star Press that the department&#039;s decision to pursue tranquilizer guns was not influenced by Mason&#039;s status in Muncie. &quot;It&#039;s not just about Harold or who it is,&quot; Barrett said. &quot;This is a scenario that we are coming onto more recently.&quot; The department has been looking at a tranquilizer gun that cost $227 and is considering buying three of them. It is unclear if and when the department might actually buy the guns and make them available to officers. The tranquilizer guns would likely stay in the cars belonging to uniform shift supervisors.

Carmelo Diaz Jr., 44, has been charged with three felonies &mdash; two counts of aggravated assault against a family member and extreme animal cruelty &mdash; plus misdemeanor battery against a household member, according to a Las Cruces Police Department news release. Diaz, of the 2500 block of Kentwood Court, is being held at the Do&ntilde;a Ana County Detention Center. His wife told police that Diaz became upset when she declined to kiss him, grabbing her by the neck and pinning her to a kitchen wall, according to a criminal complaint filed in Magistrate Court. Diaz then ran upstairs and &quot;threatened to take his own life,&quot; the complaint states. His wife followed, eventually finding him in the bathroom, but not before he allegedly pushed her to the ground. Diaz was armed with a .40-caliber handgun, according to the news release. Frightened, Diaz&#039;s wife fled to his teenage son&#039;s room. Diaz allegedly followed her, then pointed the gun at her face. Later, he allegedly pointed the gun at his teenage son, the complaint states, while saying, &quot;I don&#039;t give a (expletive). I&#039;ll kill everybody.&quot; Eventually Diaz&#039;s wife and two children ran to a neighbor&#039;s house. Diaz&#039;s wife told police that Diaz rang the doorbell, asking about who they were calling on the phone, the complaint states. Diaz reportedly told his son to &quot;tell dispatch everything&#039;s OK,&quot; the complaint states. Diaz then walked away, and that&#039;s when police allege he shot the family&#039;s mixed-breed dog. A veterinarian determined the dog was paralyzed, according to the LCPD news release, and it was euthanized. Police responded to the family&#039;s home about 8:30 p.m. Wednesday after a call about a domestic disturbance. Diaz reportedly drove away in his silver Toyota Camry before LCPD officers arrived.\r\nLater, officers located Diaz&#039;s car parked on White Sage Arc. Police found a shell casing near Diaz&#039;s car &mdash; he apparently shot his cell phone, breaking it and a car window. Officers later blocked many of the streets in the Sonoma Ranch and Northrise area while conducting a search for Diaz, according to scanner traffic Wednesday. A nearby gym was locked down during portions of the search. An officer at the family&#039;s home saw Diaz hiding in the shadows, according to scanner traffic. Officers ordered him to drop the handgun which he did before being taken into custody. A Border Patrol spokesman confirmed Thursday that Diaz is an agent with the federal agency.\r\nDuring his video arraignment Thursday in Magistrate Court, Diaz said he had been working for Border Patrol for nearly four years. The Border Patrol&#039;s communications department released a statement on the matter to the Sun-News: &quot;The Border Patrol takes every allegation of misconduct seriously. While a comment specific to this event cannot be made due to an ongoing investigation by another jurisdiction, the Border Patrol will cooperate fully with any investigation. The Border Patrol understands its responsibility to maintain the trust of the community in which we serve and does not tolerate any activity by any of its personnel that may jeopardize that trust.&quot; Generally, agents facing felony charges are subject to suspension or administrative leave, said Border Patrol special operations supervisor Joe Romero in an email. &quot;It depends on different variables as each case is looked at independently,&quot; Romero said. Diaz told Magistrate Judge Kent Wingenroth that he served in the Air Force and was stationed at Holloman Air Force Base for some time. Wingenroth set a $20,000 surety bond.\r\nDiaz requested a court-appointed attorney.','http://www.lcsun-news.com/las_cruces-news/ci_25241114/man-suspected-threatening-family-shooting-dog','Unknown','Carmelo Diaz Jr.','1','0',0,0,0,0,0,'Plain Clothes',3,3,1,2,0,1),(790,'2010-02-04','Illinois','Chicago','Chicago Police Department',1,2,0,'Unconfirmed','Chicago police shot a dog this evening while executing some kind of warrant in the Logan Square neighborhood on the Northwest Side.

In 2013, when he was a school resource officer, it came to light that he was arrested under the charges of second degree rape and molestation while he attended Wagoner High School in 1997. An affidavit shows that a 14-year-old girl accused Antwine of touching her inappropriately while they were in class, to which Antwine admitted doing so. Antwine then entered into an agreement of deferred prosecution with the State of Oklahoma that stated charges would not be filed if he met the conditions of the agreement for four years.

What went unexplained was where the tame buck may have originated. Powhatan Point resident Heidi Brown offered a likely explanation for the animal, often referred to as Bucky. &quot;I believe that this deer once belonged to my late father-in-law, Marvin Brown. After the fawn&#039;s mother had been hit by a car, Marvin rescued and raised the young deer,&quot; Brown wrote in a letter. She said the deer was amazing to see, behaving like a dog by playing with children, greeting visitors, following Marvin Brown around and even enjoying car rides. &quot;On November 18, 2013, Marvin was shot and killed,&quot; Brown went on to say. &quot;A few days after Marvin&#039;s murder, his deer ran away. The deer was wearing an orange collar for his own protection during hunting season. But, given his friendly nature, we did not expect the young deer to survive for very long, especially without Marvin to care for him.&quot; When Bucky wandered into Clarington several months ago, he was wearing an orange collar. The small village is just seven miles from Brown&#039;s home in Powhatan Point, and the age of the buck in question seems to fit the timeline. Brown stated that she was relieved to read about residents caring for Bucky, calling it &quot;heart-warming.&quot; &quot;Although it was devastating to learn that the little guy was put down, I am grateful to the people in Clarington who cared so much for him during his short life.&quot; Meanwhile, outrage over ODNR&#039;s decision to kill Bucky has continued to grow. Online news outlets have reported on the issue, while animal rights activists and others have jumped in to criticize ODNR on its Facebook page. There was even a yousign.com petition to fire the officer who shot Bucky in the public park near the edge of Clarington. As of Wednesday afternoon, it had received 3, 052 signatures, but on Thursday afternoon the petition had been deleted. Much of the outrage centers around the fact that the deer was killed in front of two young girls who had fed and pet him. Bucky is also connected to a petition on change.org labeled &quot;Support Trooper&#039;s Law &amp; Make Compassion Legal! Protect Animal Wildlife &amp; Stop the Killing!&quot; The petition calls for the state to allow willing and licensed rehabilitation experts, veterinarians and caretakers to provide appropriate care for injured wildlife, such as deer or raccoons. &quot;The hands of our veterinarians have been tied by the government. They are not permitted to treat certain wildlife such as an injured fawn...and, they [ODNR] threaten compassionate caretakers with arrest, jail time and fines,&quot; the petition says. Clarington resident Sandy Potts, whose yard was frequently visited by Bucky, had this to say about the petition. &quot;Although we lost our Bucky to the cruelty of the ODNR, his death has brought a national spotlight to our cause. The people at saving Trooper were working with us to help save Bucky and we need to support them so this law is passed and never happens again,&quot; she wrote on her Facebook page. The controversy reached the Ohio Humane Society, whose director, Corey Roscoe, sent a letter to Scott Zody, Chief of the Ohio Division of Wildlife. Roscoe expressed disappointment with ODNR&#039;s decision, and said that many Ohio residents have placed distressed calls to his agency. &quot;This did not appear to be a case of illegal possession, but rather of a habituated deer who was not sick or exhibiting threatening or dangerous behavior. We...agree that it would have been best for him as well as the public that this conditioning be broken, but a non-lethal approach should have been tried before the rather arbitrary decision to kill the animal was made,&quot; Roscoe wrote. He went on to say he would welcome a meeting with ODNR staff to discuss protocol and resources for situations like these in the future.','http://www.timesleaderonline.com/page/content.detail/id/561380/New-light-shed-on-deer-s-origins.html?nav=5010','Bucky','Unknown','1','0',2,0,0,3,3,'Uniform',3,3,0,0,0,0),(800,'2014-06-24','West Virginia','Milton','West Virginia State Police Special Response Unit',1,30,0,'Beagle and Basset Hound mix 6yo','Hello, My name is Jeremy Sweat. I live with my wife Ginger and our two small children in Mason County, West Virginia. On June 24, 2014 the WV State Police Special Response Team shot and killed our dog. The WVSP were searching for a man named Jonathan Jeffers, who they allege shot at an officer while he responded to a domestic violence call. Mr. Jeffers fled from the police and ended up in the woods near our house. We live in a very rural, and secluded area near Milton, WV. My wife Ginger was at home with our two small children, RaeLee and Avery. The morning of the 24th she noticed a local sheriffs vehicle in our driveway. She let me know, and I made the decision to call the sheriffs office as this was way out of the ordinary. They noted that I called, but didn&#039;t provide any information as to why they were on our property. Over the next two hours, the police presence increased, including a helicopter flying overhead. I called the sheriffs office again to make sure they knew that my wife and children were home. At that time they explained that they were actively searching for a fugitive, and they would alert the officers that my family was inside our home.\r\nAt approximately 1pm my wife put our oldest daughter down for her daily nap in the nursery. When she came out she noticed 6-8 men dressed as soldiers come out of the woods and into the gravel road in front of our home with a K9. Our dog Willy Pete, a six year old beagle/basset mix was asleep on his pillow right outside our front door, and directly beneath the window that Ginger was watching from. The K9 unit was \r\nbarking when Ginger watched Willy Pete get up and leave the porch toward the officers. Ginger watched as one of the men raised his rifle towards Pete. She immediately ran outside to the top of the steps of our porch and began screaming for them to not shoot our dog as he would not hurt them. A shot was fired and Ginger saw a plume of dust come up from our yard between our dog and the officers. My dog being very afraid of guns (we live in an area with a lot of hunters) immediately turned around to run for Ginger, who was still desperately yelling for them to stop when they fired 3 more times. Willy Pete ran behind our house while Ginger ran through it to the back door. She saw Pete on the ground gasping for air and watched him die next to our air conditioning unit. Moments later an officer came into our house. Ginger was literally in the floor sobbing begging to know why they had killed our dog. He responded &quot;Ma&#039;am we couldn&#039;t let our dogs fight. We are dog people too. Where is your shovel so we can bury him.&quot; Ginger told them I was on the way home and she wasn&#039;t going to do anything until I got there. I arrived approximately 15-20 minutes later to a veritable sea of police officers and vehicles. My wife was on our porch screaming and so upset I couldn&#039;t even understand what she was saying. I was screaming at them asking why they had killed my dog when I heard Ginger say they \r\nhad shot towards her and the house (our younger daughter was in her chair in the living room by the window). I asked them why they would shoot at our house when the person I found out later to be the one who killed our dog grabbed my arm and cursed at me saying id better calm down before I got myself into trouble. Almost immediately they were asking me where my shovel was, and that they would do us the service of burying the dog. I told them I would help dig the hole, but I couldn&#039;t bear to look at my boy like that. Ginger and I gave statements to one of the officers and I began digging my dogs grave. The officers finished the hole and buried my dog. Before they left one of them came in and made an attempt at apologizing for what they had done. Ginger confronted him by asking why they shot towards her and our house. His demeanor instantly changed, and he left immediately. Several days later the WV State Police \r\noffered us a voucher from the Humane Society for a dog from a local shelter. We respectfully declined. Being on a very limited income, saying that we couldn&#039;t afford an attorney to represent us would be an understatement. We decided to use the only tool that we felt we had available and made efforts to get our story on local news media and the internet. Almost immediately we received an outpouring of support. \r\nThe WV State Police were obviously unprepared to handle the backlash and decided to make statements through their Facebook Page. These comments included the statement that reports of the dog being shot as it was running away were &quot;completely fictitious&quot;, and insinuated that we were inciting violence towards the police. All we did was ask for an investigation into the shooting. Based on these statements we decided to do the unthinkable and dig our dog up to have a necropsy performed. Several days later the WV State Police issued a lengthy press release as can been seen here . This press release is almost entirely false as it pertains to the killing of our dog. They claim that Sgt. S.T. Harper shot Willy Pete three times within 3-5 \r\nfeet as Pete continued to advance. However, we are in possession of a necropsy report which clearly shows our dog only has one entry wound and no exit. This means that by their own admission they must account for the other two bullets that are not in our dog. The WV state police are absolutely responsible for where we stand today. Ginger and I are left with the heartbreaking loss of our loyal dog that we watched born into this world. Ginger will live the rest of her life with the horrific image of him running desperately to her for help. We have had our sense of security taken from us, and even worse my families lives were endangered when that officer made the terrible decision to shoot at my dog. Thankfully our children and my wife were spared. The damage they inflicted on us is not something that will soon be repaired. We will one day have to teach our children about what they do when they are in trouble, and we want to tell them like our parents told us, you pick up the phone and call 9-1-1. \r\nUnfortunately, I won&rsquo;t be able to teach them that without the specter of these events flashing through my mind. Ginger and I have always been respectful of law enforcement, and refuse to give any credence to anyone who threatens violence against anyone brave enough to do their job. Ginger and I want our girls to be proud of the message that we leave behind. That message is that you stand up for what is right, even when it is against seemingly insurmountable odds. We have retained the counsel of Richard B. Rosenthal, General Counsel for The Lexus Project and Maxwell Hiltner of Mills, Mills, Fiely &amp; Lucas. We intend to pursue federal action against the WV state police seeking an injunction to require officers be trained on how to handle encounters with domesticated animals as well as establish a requirement for Independent oversight of future incidents. Nothing can give us our sense of security or our precious family member back, but we can take solace in knowing that we did what was necessary to prevent this kind of horrific event from disrupting another family&rsquo;s life. God forbid the next time something like this happens the consequences could be infinitely worse. Since this happened to us last month we have become aware of just how often this happens in our country. The WV state police have only kept records for 4 years on dog shootings. Based on those records they have killed 15 dogs including Willy Pete. Sgt. S.T. Harper is responsible for three of them. This is one police agency in WV in 4 years. We shudder to think of the numbers once police agencies all across the country are considered. Our Facebook page receives information on a new incident almost every day.

The Chief added that the dog was running loose on Tuesday night in east Wheeling, and a male owner received a citation for a &quot;vicious dog at large.&quot; Chief Schwertfeger said he plans to conduct a thorough investigation into the incident, which is protocol anytime an officer discharges a weapon during a call.

Randy Green sued the Village of South Holland, police Officer Chad Barden and other unknown officers, in Federal Court. South Holland, pop. 21,000, is a southern suburb of Chicago. &quot;On Sunday, July 22, 2012, two South Holland Police Officers arrived in separate vehicles at the home of Randy Green between 9-10 am, to investigate a purported dog off-leash (at large),&quot; the complaint states. &quot;Upon information and belief, a caller had identified the dog at large as &#039;a big old gray dog runnin&#039; around.&#039; The caller made no mention of the dog being dangerous, vicious, or aggressive. &quot;The two South Holland officers arrived while plaintiff Randy Green and his family were asleep inside of their home, and where Mr. Green&#039;s Cane Corso dog, Grady, was sitting on the front porch. &quot;Upon information and belief, the chain holding Grady in the Green family backyard had popped, allowing Grady to be off leash on and around Mr. Green&#039;s residence. &quot;Both South Holland officers were equipped with dog-catching poles in the trunks of their vehicles, but neither attempted to use the dog-catching poles to capture the purported dog at large. &quot;South Holland officer Chad Barden stood, with his gun drawn, near the Green family home while the dog Grady sat on the front porch. &quot;The accompanying South Holland officer stood, leaning against his own police vehicle, approximately 100 feet away from Officer Chad Barden. &quot;The dog Grady walked past both officers on more than one occasion without incident, thereafter lazily returning to the front porch of the Green residence. &quot;At no time did the dog Grady make physical contact with either officer. &quot;The South Holland police officers stood outside the Green family home for approximately twenty minutes. &quot;At this time, the dog Grady approached Officer Barden again as he was standing nearest the Green family home.\r\n&quot;Shortly thereafter, Officer Barden shot the dog Grady three times for no reason.&quot;\r\nGrady, wounded, ran into the back yard and Green &quot;rushed outside&quot; to help him and take him to a vet. Citing an &quot;Expert Report,&quot; Green claims that &quot;video surveillance footage from the Green family residence revealed the absence of any charging, lunging or showing of teeth by the dog Grady and instead showed the dog Grady seeking &#039;greater distance between the officer and himself,&#039; displaying &#039;calming [body] signals&#039; by &#039;looking away from the officers and showing his [Grady&#039;s] flank,&#039; and moving in a &#039;trot.&#039;&quot; The family immediately &quot;took Grady to an emergency veterinary facility where Grady was treated,&quot; the complaint states. Meanwhile, &quot;South Holland police officers walked onto the residential property of Randy Green, including his backyard and other private areas near his home,&quot; Green claims. A month later, South Holland police delivered a letter accusing Green of having a dangerous dog. Green seeks damages for unreasonable seizure, trespass, intentional infliction of emotional distress, violation of the Illinois Humane Care for Animals Act, and malicious prosecution.

Dan Marocchi said his 2-year-old German shepherd, named Max, never attacked the officer and didn&#039;t deserve to die. &quot;The Ogden Police Department is trying to cover up a bad shooting,&quot; he said Monday. However, Ogden Police Lt. Chad Ledford said the dog lunged at two officers before being killed. &quot;This could have been avoided if he (Marocchi) controlled his dogs like he was asked to do,&quot; Ledford said. The incident began about 5:30 p.m. Sunday when police responded to a report of a man with a gun at Marocchi&#039;s residence in the 2400 block of Jackson Avenue. Marocchi, 67, believes he was reported to police because he answered his door carrying a handgun for protection because a long-haired man, whom he didn&#039;t know, was standing on his porch. When police arrived at Marocchi&#039;s home, they ordered him to keep his German shepherd and another dog, an Australian shepherd mix, inside. &quot;The owner allowed them to run out,&quot; Ledford said. The black-and-brown Australian shepherd mix, named Rusty, escaped and hasn&#039;t been found. The German shepherd charged at an officer, who was unable to deploy a Taser to subdue the dog, Ledford said. Then the German shepherd leaped at another officer, who knocked the dog down and shot twice with a handgun, killing it, he added. Marocchi said he never saw Max charge the first officer or any attempt by the officer to deploy a Taser. It only took a few seconds for Max to run from the house to a neighbor&#039;s driveway, where it was shot, said Marocchi, who believes that didn&#039;t allow for enough time for a second attack on a police officer. However, Marocchi admits he only heard gunfire and didn&#039;t see the actual shooting. Marocchi added that when he looked over at Max, the dog was dead in his neighbor&#039;s driveway and the police officer who shot him was about 6 feet away.\r\nThere was no report of the dog injuring any of the officers, Ledford said. Marocchi said he was kept handcuffed in a patrol car for about 90 minutes but wasn&#039;t arrested in connection with the initial man-with-a-gun complaint. The man-with-a-gun-incident investigation will be screened by the Weber County Attorney&#039;s Office to determine if any charges should be filed, Ledford said. Ogden police officials will also conduct an internal investigation into the shooting of Marocchi&#039;s dog. Police in Ogden also shot and killed a pit bull in January 2012 in the 1000 block of Patterson Avenue. In that incident, the dog reportedly approached officers in an aggressive manner.','http://e.standard.net/stories/2013/03/04/man-refutes-ogden-police-claims-fatal-shooting-german-shepherd','Max','Two Unknown Police','2','0',2,0,0,0,2,'Uniform',2,2,0,0,2,0),(820,'2012-01-28','Utah','Ogden','Ogden Police Department',1,50,1,'Unconfirmed','An Ogden bystander was somehow injured as she stood nearby watching police shoot and kill an aggressive pit bull in her neighborhood.

Police were trying to determine if she was injured by debris from the roadway or from a bullet fragment after the round struck the pavement and curb. Three officers said they were in the 1000 block of Patterson Street about 2 p.m. investigating an incident when an unleashed pit bull charged at them from a nearby backyard.

The dog, Copper, had been shot by a police officer in Radford&#039;s Bisset Park a day earlier during a response to a call about two dogs not on leashes. Radford Police Chief Don Goodman said that based on the report, the use of the gun was for the officer&#039;s safety. The dog was shot Thursday afternoon, when an officer was called to the park at 3:25 p.m., he said. Accounts of the story differ after that point.\r\nDeMasi, an 18-year-old Radford University student, said he and a friend were in a secluded area of Bisset Park down a slope, allowing their dogs to play by the riverbank. He said Copper saw the officer, who&#039;d approached from above, and ran over to greet him. DeMasi said the officer yelled for him to get his dog. But before DeMasi had the chance to make a move, he said, the officer shot Copper in the leg without further warning. Goodman said the officer, whose name wasn&#039;t made available Friday, was charged by the dog as he got out of his vehicle. The officer repeatedly urged the owners to call off their dogs, Goodman said. The dogs continued at the officer in an &quot;aggressive manner,&quot; Goodman said, so the officer drew his .45-caliber pistol and shot the dog in the right front leg. Both dog owners were charged with allowing an animal to run at large, which violates a Radford city ordinance, Goodman said. &quot;If the dog would have been on a leash, this incident wouldn&#039;t have occurred,&quot; the police chief said. DeMasi admitted that he had violated the leash ordinance, but he called the incident &quot;police brutality at its finest.&quot; &quot;There was no barking or growling, that&#039;s the thing,&quot; DeMasi said. &quot;They weren&#039;t at a full sprint; they were jogging toward him wagging their tails,&quot; he said. &quot;As soon as I see them, I start screaming. Before I could get any words out, the shot went off.&quot; The officer helped escort the dog to the vet&#039;s office, where DeMasi was issued a summons. DeMasi said going to the secluded area of Bisset Park is something he and his friends do at least once a week to give their dogs a chance to play. He said they&#039;ve never had problems before, because the spot is at a riverbank away from other people and dogs. A disagreement with another dog owner over the dogs being off their leashes prompted the call, DeMasi said. His biggest complaints centered on what he saw to be excessive use of force and a lack of compassion, DeMasi said. The officer had other visible weapons, such as pepper spray and a Taser, which should have been considered before the use of a firearm, he said. Further, DeMasi said, someone trained in animal control should have been dispatched instead of a police officer. Goodman said that routinely, such a situation would have ended with a warning or a ticket. The dog allegedly charging makes it a different situation, he said. &quot;He [the officer] probably would have just told him to &#039;put your dog on a leash,&#039; and we probably would have gone about our business,&quot; Goodman said. He also said that less lethal options, such as a baton, pepper spray and Taser are designed primarily to &quot;deal with combative people.&quot; Goodman also said that those weapons are used in close proximity, which is something the officer wasn&#039;t afforded. Any incident involving use of force is internally reviewed, to make sure policy was followed, Goodman said. No administrative action has been taken against the officer, and outside of the review, the incident, for all intents and purposes, is over, he said. DeMasi said he didn&#039;t feel that the officer&#039;s safety was threatened and doesn&#039;t want the incident treated like a typical dog attack story. &quot;It was a really messed-up situation,&quot; he said. DeMasi said his vet bill so far is $500 and his ticket cost him $150. Julie Magyar with Riverside Veterinary Clinic said the dog will have to recuperate but will be fine. The bullet went through Copper&#039;s leg and caused some damage to the elbow, she said. Magyar said the dog should be in a cast for six to 10 weeks.

The officer shot and killed a chocolate Labrador named Sonic at a residence in the Eastern Hills subdivision on Nov. 3. TPD spokesman Sgt. Brent Blankley said that the officer felt threatened and thought the dog was a Pit bull-Labrador mix. Owner Rebecca James said that her dog was an eight-year-old full-blooded chocolate Lab that never showed aggression. &ldquo;Sonic was an inside dog, we had just let her out to go to the bathroom and she ran up the street with a neighbor&rsquo;s dog that morning. She was a sweet dog who liked everyone,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That police officer shot an innocent dog four times. He shouldn&rsquo;t be on the police force, because to me, that is not a stable person.&rdquo; The officer was taking a break at 7:26 a.m. when Sonic and another dog, which the officers described as a Pit bull, approached as he disembarked his motorcycle, Blankley said. &ldquo;The large brown dog was snarling and baring his teeth while running toward the officer,&rdquo; Blankley wrote in a press release issued Tuesday morning. &ldquo;When the dog got within 13 feet of the officer, he had no choice but shoot the vicious dog for his own safety. He shot the dog one time and the dog fell to the ground, but got up and kept coming towards the officer. The officer shot the dog a second time to stop him from attacking him. The officer then shot the dog two additional times to stop the suffering of the animal.&rdquo;\r\nThe other dog left the property as soon as the first shot was fired, Blankley said.\r\nJames&rsquo; sister-in-law Tana James agreed that Sonic was not vicious. &ldquo;She was overweight. She was eight-years-old and had hip dysplasia so she couldn&rsquo;t leap, jump or do a lot of active things,&rdquo; said James, who manages a veterinary clinic. &ldquo;In all the years I&rsquo;ve been around her, I&rsquo;ve never seen any aggression. I&rsquo;ve never seen her growl or lurch at anyone.&rdquo; She said that the other dog is a Boxer named Izzy that lives next door to her sister-in-law and her husband. &ldquo;She is a small, white Boxer who just gave birth to puppies,&rdquo; James said. &ldquo;They were always together.&rdquo; Rebecca James had placed missing dog fliers around the neighborhood and received a call Monday from a neighbor who told her about the shooting. She has since spoken to other neighbors who said the heard gunshots, but no barking or growling that morning.

Sherrill, who was at work, said two other boys, also believed to be 10 years old, reportedly witnessed the shooting along with his son, Jordan. The children were playing on the neighbor&rsquo;s property with that man&rsquo;s grandson, when the shooting occurred Monday, according to Sherrill. &ldquo;I own a gun myself,&rdquo; Sherrill said. &ldquo;I can understand this up to a point &hellip; that they have to put animals down, but you don&rsquo;t do it in front of kids. I&rsquo;m an adult, and I don&rsquo;t want to see it.&rdquo; Police Chief Michael Freeman offered a different version of events, maintaining the raccoon was not shot near any children or dwellings by Humane Officer Barry Accorti, who estimated he shot the animal at least 70 yards from any house.\r\nFreeman said Accorti shot the animal after determining there were no children present. Accorti, the same humane officer involved in the kitten incident in 2013, followed the law, according to Freeman. &ldquo;The property owner set a trap (which was requested from the city) and called us when he had something in the trap,&rdquo; Freeman said. &ldquo;He gave us permission to take care of the animal on his property.&rdquo; &ldquo;Because a neighbor disagrees with it doesn&rsquo;t make it wrong,&rdquo; Freeman said of the incident.\r\nFreeman said the animal was shot with .22-caliber ammunition that was fired toward the ground. &ldquo;This is a highly-trained individual who can make deductions as to whether this can be done safely or not,&rdquo; Freeman said. &ldquo;He is a certified officer. Not somebody we just hire off the street, give them a gun, and tell them to go to it.&rdquo; Under Ohio Department of Natural Resources regulations, animals can be caught and then released or destroyed by a property owner, or permission can be given by a property owner to have an animal destroyed by another party, such as a humane officer. Accorti became a humane officer in 2012 after retiring as a North Ridgeville police officer with 31 years&rsquo; service as a patrolman, detective, SWAT team commander and lieutenant. Over the years he received many commendations. An adult raccoon and number of baby raccoons were removed by the city from the neighbor&rsquo;s property last week, according to Sherrill. It was June 10, 2013, when Accorti shot and killed five kittens in response to a homeowner&rsquo;s request for help in ridding her property of stray cats, which have posed a problem in the city. That incident occurred at a residence where young children were present but did not witness the actual shooting, which triggered protest from angry residents demanding Accorti&rsquo;s firing, threats of legal action by humane groups, and thousands of signers to online petitions demanding action, including Accorti&rsquo;s dismissal. Accorti&rsquo;s actions at the time were deemed appropriate by Freeman. The episode led the city to announce it would no longer dispatch police or humane officers to handle feral cat calls, and to the formation of a citizens advisory committee in hopes of developing a better means of reducing the city&rsquo;s numbers of stray or feral cats.','http://chronicle.northcoastnow.com/2014/06/10/parent-alleges-humane-control-officer-killed-raccoon-front-kids/','Unknown','Barry Accorti','2','0',1,0,0,3,3,'Uniform',0,3,0,0,0,0),(828,'2014-03-14','Alabama','Mobile','City of Mobile Police Department',2,2,0,'Unconfirmed','&quot;My guess is when he walked up to this point here he went to go around the corner and saw them and immediately reacted, because they were after him which they&#039;re supposed to,&quot; saiid Mark Yeager.

On September 22, Anna &ldquo;Chrissy&rdquo; Music-Peed, of Macon, GA, drove to the Jones County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department to request an officer come to and investigate a vehicle that had been brought to her property by an acquaintance, that both she and her roommate strongly suspected to have been stolen.  Music told policestateusa.com that it was a Nissan Xterra from Virginia Beach, VA. As Music wrote in a blog post, &ldquo;I will not have that influence around my family,&rdquo; saying she was trying to do the right thing by making a report. The acquaintance was still on the property and Music had not let on that she had gone to talk to the police. Music wrote on that while she was providing officers with details of the stolen property, and the individual who had brought it over, she also explicitly told the police not to shoot her dogs. &ldquo;The puppy may jump, we have been trying to get her out of that,&rdquo; Music explained, stating that the dogs were friendly puppies.  She said the officers laughed and told her not to worry about it.  Unconvinced, she emphasized again:  &ldquo;PLEASE don&rsquo;t shoot my dogs, they are my babies.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ammo was just sniffing around the ground wagging her tail. And then she looked up at him, did not growl, did not bark, and before I could say anything he fired his weapon. Shot her point blank in the head.&rdquo; The officers asked her to stay at the station while units were sent to her home to obtain the property and arrest the individual who may have stolen it.  Her dogs, Ammo and Half-Pint, and roommate, Kyle Sewall, age 22, waited at home.  Sewall gave his account in an exclusive interview with policestateusa.com. &ldquo;I was waiting on officers to arrive, Ammo needed to go the bathroom and she had been whimpering for 15 minutes.  So I gave in and let her out,&rdquo; said Sewall.  &ldquo;The person who had stolen the property was outside cleaning the stolen vehicle with a shop-vac and while I kept an eye on Ammo I was talking to him playing it cool.&rdquo; He continued: &ldquo;About 5 minutes later is when the sheriffs pulled up, came flying in. Sgt David Little was exiting the vehicle and as he was exiting I noticed he already had his sidearm trained on Ammo who was just sniffing around the ground wagging her tail. And then she looked up at him, did not growl, did not bark, and before I could say anything he fired his weapon. Shot her point blank in the head,&rdquo; Sewall told policestateusa.com. &ldquo;I went to go rush toward Ammo and he trained his weapon on me,&rdquo; Sewall explained. &ldquo;I identified myself saying, &lsquo;I am Kyle, lower your weapon.&rsquo; He did and they allowed me to tend to Ammo.&rdquo; Ammo, the 10-month-old pit bull / mastiff puppy, had been struck in the head with a .40 caliber slug, fired by Sergeant David Little of the Jones County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department. While Sewall tended to the wounded animal, officers investigated the vehicle and arrested the man who was in possession of it.  Animal Control showed up and asked if Sewall wanted to euthanize the dog.  Sewall declined. Some time later, Music returned to the home after being allowed to leave the sheriff&rsquo;s office.  She found Sewall behind a kiddy pool with a strange look on his face.  He was cradling her puppy in his arms. &ldquo;They shot her,&rdquo; Sewall said. Music asked Sgt. Little why he had shot her dog, after she had explained to him and other deputies that it was a friendly, harmless puppy, and explicitly had asked him not to shoot it.  Music says that Sgt. Little denied that she had told him this, but that an accompanying deputy confirmed her account. Rather than continue to argue she quickly scrambled to make emergency arrangements to have Ammo treated by a veterinarian on a Sunday. She found an animal hospital and got her dog X-rayed and bandaged up.  The bullet had traveled down the dog&rsquo;s skull into its neck, where it disappeared from the X-ray.  She relayed on Facebook, &ldquo;They said that Ammo NEEDS this surgery to survive. We need at LEAST $800.00 for the surgery.&rdquo; Music contacted Captain Mitchell of the Jones County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department, whom she says told her that the dog was shot because it &ldquo;charged at&rdquo; Sgt. Little, which contradicts Sewall&rsquo;s eyewitness account. It was only a year ago when Sgt. D. Little shot another dog in Jones County; an American Bulldog named Eden. &ldquo;It is officers like Sgt. Little, who lack discipline and necessary training and firearm safety, that pose a threat to the very people that they swore and took an oath to protect,&rdquo; Sewall told policestateusa.com. Ammo&#039;s surgery was completed successfully and Ammo has apparently recovered from her wounds.','http://www.13wmaz.com/story/news/local/gray-jones/2013/11/03/3424297/','Ammo','David Little','0','1',0,0,0,0,2,'Uniform',1,1,2,2,2,2),(830,'2012-05-25','Georgia','Macon','Jones County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department',1,50,1,'American Bulldog','My dog, Eden, was an American Bulldog shot and killed by Jones County Sheriff deputy, XXXXX XXXXXttle Jr. on 5/25/2012. She was merely on my neighbors property across from my mothers home where they were kept confined since 2008. The deputy&#039;s prejudice against pit bulls lead him to react instead of investigate. He claimed Eden became aggressive after she was pepper sprayed, and began to attack him when he turned to enter his patrol car. Thus, turning to her with his weapon drawn firing one shot in which he claim was the shoulder. The Animal control officer was called after the shooting to find Eden lying paralyzed waist down still breathing. My dogs did not have a collar on them because they were fenced inside. It happened on a Memorial Day weekend, and I could not contact the Animal Control Office until Tuesday 5/29/2012. I have filed a complaint with the Sheriff&#039;s department, sent Eden for a legal necropsy. The Jones County Deputy suffered no injuries. My American bulldogs were fenced in a 10 X 10 on my mothers property. Prior to that they had full run of her back yard until the house caught fire Aug 2011, forcing me to put them in a small 10X10. I did not have them with a collar in their pen, and I did not have them with a microchip. Since 2008 they have only escaped the property twice. This last time they were on a parrallel street and the neighbor claim the dogs were aggresive to him and he called the Jones County Sheriff department. According to them, the dogs did not bite anyone, or destroy any property. Reportedly, they were barking aggressively at the other neighbors dog behind the neighbors fence. The deputy reported that the dogs approached him as he exited his patrol car to investigates the neighbors complaint. He then stated he attempted to close his patrol car door when the dogs approached him. He drew his pepper spray to shoo the dogs away is what he claimed. My male dog, Caleb laid down while the female Eden continued her approach then backed off. He stated he then turned toward his vehicle when Eden approached him aggressively, so he drew his weapon and fired. Hitting her in the shoulder. Animal Control was notified after the shooting to the scene. When they arrived on scene, ACO (Animal Control Officer) Jennifer, stated Eden was near death and paralyzed, but was still breathing. She stated that Caleb was stand offish at that point but he was captured and held at the animal shelter until Tuesday 5/29/2012. The ACO claim she did not have any knowledge of the owner, so she had to euthanize Eden. ACO Jennifer surrendered Caleb to my mother after verifying with my veterinarian that his shots were current. She later waived all fines and fees surrounding the event when she released Eden&#039;s body to me on 6/7/2012 We got permission from our employer in Dutch Harbor, Alaska to pick up Caleb from Macon, Georgia and bring him back with us on 6/12/2012. After speaking with Capt Mitchell of Jones County Sheriff, he felt his deputy responded appropriately. I asked him whether there were any reports of my dog biting anyone? Did the deputy have any training in responding to aggressive dog calls? Is the deputy qualified to determine an aggressive dog, or is their a hearing required? What is the departments policy for notifying Animal Control, and why didn&#039;t he wait until they arrive before conducting his investigation? Capt. Mitchell was unable to answer my questions. The ACO stated that Eden was found shot at the front of the neighbors car, and Caleb was found at the rear. That gave me the impression that the dogs did not approach the officer but he in turn approached them. ACO Jennifer claimed there were no records kept by her on her response to the call, nor did she keep track of what time she was dispatched, or what time she was on scene. If I wanted those records, I would have to go through the sheriff&#039;s department which she claimed she didn&#039;t have. I spoke to the clerk at the sheriff&#039;s department, and she claimed the person responsible for the 911 recordings was out of town. All in all, I am getting a run around from the sheriff&#039;s department to my veterinarian. My own vet documented that my dog was a pit bull until I showed him the certificate of her breed being American bulldog. I had them to correct all her records. Eden is currently getting a legal necropsy at Tifton University here in Georgia. Jones S.O. Incident Report reads as follow: On 5-25-12 I responded toXXXXX in reference to some aggressive dogs.

I next closed the door on my patrol vehicle. I walked about 10ft in front of my patrol vehicle to speak with the complainant Tirrell Lester. He stated that the dogs were aggressive with him when he attempted to come outside. He stated they also went to his neighbors house at 146 and attempted to get at a dog there.

It happened a week ago in Kalihi after officers responded to a domestic call in the area. As police officers were about to leave, Bruce, a two-year-old Staffordshire Bull Terrier mix, got loose from his cage and lunged at the officers, and then got shot. When the family asked police if they could take the dog to the veterinarian, they were told to stay put until an investigation was completed.\r\nThe first thing KHON2 News asked HPD was why the family was forced to wait. We were told it&rsquo;s standard policy to do a thorough investigation after an officer fires a weapon, so the scene had to be preserved. So we then asked that if this were instead a person, would there be a delay in getting help? Late Friday afternoon, a HPD spokeswoman called back and said the officers made a mistake and should have allowed the family to get medical help for the dog. One week after being shot in the chest, Bruce looks almost as good as new, although there are some stitches that still need to help him heal. His owners still can&rsquo;t believe what they had just gone through.\r\n&ldquo;It was terrifying for all of us,&rdquo; said the dog&rsquo;s owner Kristen Butac. &ldquo;We never would have thought this would happen to us. He&rsquo;s our family, so of course we&rsquo;re going react the way we did. We&rsquo;re upset.&rdquo; Butac said three officers were walking outside the house when Bruce lunged at them. The first two managed to sidestep and avoid the dog, but the third officer fired a shot. An HPD spokeswoman said the officer described the dog as aggressive and vicious. When asked how much was the dog bleeding, Butac said &ldquo;well, to us, it seemed like a lot. I mean, seeing something like that, of course, you&rsquo;re panicking. You don&rsquo;t know what else could have happened.&rdquo; She said the officers would not let anyone leave the house, even as they pleaded to let someone take Bruce to the vet. But they were told nobody leaves until the investigation is finished, which took about an hour. Investigators found the shell casing, but they couldn&rsquo;t find the bullet, which made the family even more nervous, thinking that it could still be inside the dog&rsquo;s chest. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t know what other injuries he had, so we were just trying our best to just put  pressure on his wound,&rdquo; Butac said. After the family rushed Bruce to an emergency care veterinarian, they did get some good news. &ldquo;The vet said he was a very lucky dog. What happened was the bullet had entered and exited his chest. The only damage was to his soft tissues.&rdquo; The family plans to file a lawsuit against HPD.

The lawsuit claims the dogs were running toward the backyard, away from the officers, when they were shot.

They said they remember their pet as a large, friendly lap dog. Tulsa Police Sgt. Jeff Davis said the off-duty officer was walking his own dog in the 6900 block of East 18th Street late Thursday afternoon when the pit bull, which was loose, approached his pet. Davis said the officer felt threatened, so he shot the dog, killing it. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an unfortunate thing,&rdquo; Davis said. Grant Holm, 50, lives three doors down from where the shooting occurred. Holm witnessed the situation as he, his wife and their grandchild spoke outside with a neighbor. Holm said he saw Titus run from between two houses on the other side of the street toward him with his tail wagging but then shift directions toward the officer when it saw two other dogs. The officer was walking with a large dog on a leash and was with a woman who had a small dog on a leash, Holm said. Titus went to the large dog and appeared to be greeting the other animal from a submissive posture with its head down, Holm said. The officer pulled on his dog&rsquo;s leash, rearing the animal up onto its hind legs, Holm said. Titus then moved to fill the void created by the officer pulling on the leash, he said. &ldquo;The man, as smooth as you please, reached behind him, pointed (a handgun), put it up to the dog and shot it in the head or neck area, and Titus immediately went down,&rdquo; Holm said, noting that the officer didn&rsquo;t say a word before pulling the trigger. As Titus lay in the grass, moving his legs and yelping, &ldquo;he (the officer) bent down, aimed at it and shot it in the head with everybody in shock,&rdquo; Holm said, adding that the second and final shot sent adults scurrying to collect children and take them inside their homes. Holm said he took issue with what he believes to be the officer&rsquo;s unwarranted shooting of a friendly dog. Holm said he doesn&rsquo;t know why the officer didn&rsquo;t try to get Titus to stop, ask any of the many people outside if the dog was theirs, or simply holler for help.\r\nHe said he also doesn&rsquo;t know why the officer needed to walk over and shoot Titus a second time when the animal already was lying on the ground severely wounded.\r\n&ldquo;I might have seen it differently if they were fighting, but there was no fighting,&rdquo; Holm said, also saying there was no barking or growling. On Friday afternoon, Blazek and Slane were trying to cope with the loss of their pet. The couple, who have been dating for almost a year and live together, didn&rsquo;t witness the shooting. Slane, 26, said she was inside their home and Blazek was away when Blazek&rsquo;s brother, Joseph Blazek, let Titus and the couple&rsquo;s other dog into the backyard, which is enclosed by a 6-foot-tall privacy fence. Just that morning, however, Titus had found a way to get out through a small opening in the fence, Slane said. Slane said that was how Titus escaped from the yard. Nicholas Blazek, 26, said he has owned Titus since bringing him home as a puppy. He said Titus was large, weighing about 60 to 65 pounds, but was a friendly dog who would sleep in bed with them. He recalled how a friend with a 2-year-old daughter would come over and the youngster would ride Titus like a horse.\r\n&ldquo;He was just a big goober &mdash; a big lap dog,&rdquo; Blazek said. He said Titus had never shown aggression. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s never even been in a dog fight,&rdquo; he said. After Titus was shot, Blazek was ticketed for having a dog at large. The owners have the option of paying the preset fine of $75 or having a hearing in municipal court, Davis said.\r\nDavis, who declined to release the name of the officer, said he won&rsquo;t be placed on administrative leave because he was off-duty and the shooting didn&rsquo;t involve a person. Leland Ashley, a Tulsa police spokesman, said the incident will be treated the same as a citizen shooting an animal when threatened. Ashley also noted that the officer used his personal firearm, not a police-issued weapon. Slane and her boyfriend said Friday that they want justice for Titus and for the officer to be reprimanded. &ldquo;It was definitely an unjust, unnecessary, horrible event,&rdquo; she said.','http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/local/witness-owners-of-pit-bull-killed-by-off-duty-tulsa/article_400fc734-6d16-51cb-8748-e188852b8ab1.html','Titus','Adam Lovell','2','0',1,0,0,0,1,'Plain Clothes',3,3,2,2,2,2),(834,'2013-11-10','Georgia','Atlanta','Atlanta Police Department',1,10,1,'Labrador and Pit Bull mix 2yo','Last November, a dog in Atlanta was killed by a City of Atlanta Police Department officer. According to their Facebook: Justice for Jane Our Family Dog page, the family learned last week that the officer involved has been cleared of any wrong doing. After an Internal Affairs investigation, Investigator Art Nixon along with his supervisors, ruled Officer Brian Carswell of the City of Atlanta Police Department completely justified in murdering Jane in her fenced-in front yard on a quiet Sunday morning. This tragic story began November 10, 2013, when the family of slain pit bull Jane, Matthew and Kelley Rodriguez, was saying goodbye to relatives visiting them from North Carolina. During the excitement of packing, an 11-year-old girl accidentally dialed 911. Emergency dispatch called the family back, and the niece confirmed it had been an accidental call. An hour later police arrived at the house, where they knocked once without identifying themselves. Kelley was nursing her three-month-old baby upstairs, and thought the visiting family had returned to pick up an item perhaps missed during their packing. The family dogs, Jane and Lucy, were lying with her on the bed. Kelley shouted that she was coming to the door, and when she opened the door leading outside, the dogs ran out. At the time, the City of Atlanta police officers had their backs turned, but quickly turned around and drew their weapons. Officer Brian Carswell allegedly shot Jane from the gate, while the dog was on the steps of the home, several feet away. Another officer had his weapon aimed at Lucy. If not for the fast thinking of Kelley, Lucy, too would have been executed. Kelley quickly picked Lucy up, where she carried the surviving dog upstairs, where she feared for the safety of her family. &quot;I ran up the stairs to get my infant son as I was terrified, and from the upstairs balcony I started to yell, You killed my dog! Why did you come here to kill my dog!!!??? I couldn&#039;t believe what was happening!&quot; Both dogs were rescues, and very much loved by family and neighbors alike. These neighbors, who all knew Jane and Lucy, gathered outside the yard in disbelief. To make matters worse, the officers wouldn&#039;t allow anyone to come near Jane, not even to transport her for emergency treatment. It wasn&#039;t until more officer&#039;s arrived that Kelley was able to give permission to a neighbor to take Jane to a vet. By then it was too late. Kelley couldn&#039;t even be with her dog as she took her last breath. She had to remain with her infant, but was able to contact Matthew, who was on a charity bike ride at the time. Jane died from her injuries. &quot;I cannot express what we feel. We keep playing this over and over. There was no reason that the Officer had to kill Jane. She was a friendly dog, everyone loved her, and she did not give him any reason to feel threatened.&quot; Justice for Jane didn&#039;t happen with the internal investigation. The Rodriguez will now join the families of other dogs slain by police, and spread the word about just how often a family dog is murdered by police. Jane was shot by police in her own yard, while police officer&#039;s were at the gate, then denied emergency veterinary care until it was too late.

While noting that Chrisman was doing his job, the judge also said he went too far. &quot;Society entrusted you with the power and authority of a law enforcement officer,&quot; Granville told Chrisman. &quot;On this occasion, you failed to meet that responsibility.&quot; Chrisman was arrested after he shot and killed Danny Rodriguez, 28, and the man&#039;s pit bull when he and his partner responded to Rodriguez&#039;s home after a frantic call from his mother that her son was acting violent. Chrisman maintained the shootings were self-defense but his partner told jurors the situation had been defused before Chrisman opened fire. At his sentencing hearing, Rodriguez&#039;s mother tearfully pleaded with the judge to sentence Chrisman to the maximum of 15 years in prison. &quot;I feel so guilty,&quot; Elvira Fernandez told the judge. &quot;If I never picked up that telephone and made that call, Daniel would be alive today.&quot; Several police officers testified on Chrisman&#039;s behalf, calling him a good man who supported his colleagues and loved his job. &quot;I&#039;ve never seen him lose his temper on or off the job,&quot; Phoenix officer Matt Morgan said. Chrisman pleaded for leniency, calling the events of that day a tragedy. &quot;But I would ask that you understand that that tragedy reaches both sides,&quot; he said. Outside court, Fernandez said she was disappointed with the sentence. &quot;It just didn&#039;t seem fair,&quot; she said, holding back tears. Chrisman had the support throughout his case of the Phoenix Law Enforcement Association, which found his conviction to be a travesty of justice. &quot;Rich is kind of an unfortunate victim of the justice system,&quot; said Ken Crane, the union&#039;s vice president. &quot;He was just trying to do his job.&quot; During his trial, Chrisman described a chaotic scene in which his partner shirked his duties as backup while Rodriguez&#039;s pit bull became aggressive. He said that at one point, the dog lunged at him leading him to shoot the animal twice. Chrisman explained how pepper spray and his stun gun failed to subdue the suspect as the two struggled, and Rodriguez picked up a bicycle from the living room floor. &quot;He was going to smash my brains in ... I fired two rounds, center mass,&quot; Chrisman told jurors. Prosecutors accused him of being reckless and escalating the situation unnecessarily. Defense attorneys noted that Chrisman had never fired his weapon once during 10 years on the force and was defending himself. But Chrisman&#039;s partner, Sergio Virgillo, told jurors Chrisman was on a tear from the moment he approached Rodriguez&#039;s door, then pulled out his gun and pressed it to the suspect&#039;s head. Chrisman denied the allegations and accused Virgillo of not being there to help with the struggling suspect, who was high on methamphetamine, and at one point even taking a personal call on his cell phone during the incident. Chrisman was fired about five months after the shooting. Virgillo remains employed with the Phoenix Police Department. Chrisman had previously been caught on video planting a crack cocaine pipe on a woman - an event that landed him on the Brady List of police officers proven to have lied under oath.','http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/bastard/2010/11/richard_chrisman_phoenix_police_department.php','Junior','Richard Chrisman and Sergio Virgillo','1','0',0,0,1,0,0,'Uniform',1,2,1,1,2,1),(836,'2013-08-15','Massachusetts','Leominster','Leominster Police Department',1,2,0,'Unconfirmed','Fifteen-year-old Kassidy Edwards can&rsquo;t forget the horrific sound. &ldquo;It was just two big loud popping noises right after each other and there was nothing after that,&rdquo; she describes. Those popping noises? Police shooting a dog who was hit by a car because they couldn&rsquo;t find its owner or anyone to help. Kassidy and her mother say they discovered the dog hit by a car on their Leominster street early in one morning this spring and called police for help. They say the police responded right away and police began trying to find the dog&rsquo;s owner or a kennel or an animal control officer to come take the dog. Police say they did all they could, but because Leominster had no animal control officer, and no other neighboring community&rsquo;s officer could help, they shot and killed the dog. They say the dog was seriously injured and they called Fitchburg&rsquo;s Animal Control officer to take custody but they couldn&rsquo;t respond. They tried all of the local animal shelters and the dog was dying so they were advised as a last resort to shoot it. Kassidy says, &ldquo;It was sad, the dog got shot, they didn&rsquo;t know what else to do so they had to take the dog into the woods and shoot him.&rdquo;\r\nState officials say this never would have happened if Leominster had an animal control officer. The say the officer could have come to the scene and taken the dog away. MSPCA Chief Richard LeBlond says he was stunned to learn the City of Leominster would be without an animal control officer for a year. Chief LeBlond says, &ldquo;In this age it shouldn&rsquo;t be happening.&rdquo; We contacted city leaders for answers. Leominster Purchasing Agent Greg Chapdelaine says they had difficulty finding someone to fill the role, but after a year-long search, they hired an animal control officer that started August 1st. This comes as an effort to make these positions more professional and uniform from town to town is implemented. By law, all cities and towns must designate an animal control officer every year. The state recently strengthened its animal control Laws. Officers must have proper training, and state officials will be keeping a much closer eye on them. Chief LeBlond says the stakes are higher than people realize, explaining, &ldquo;All we have to do is lose a person&rsquo;s life and what&rsquo;s that worth.&rdquo; Kassidy hopes no one will have to go through what she did and hear the shooting of a dog.','http://boston.cbslocal.com/2013/08/05/leominster-police-shoot-dog-as-last-resort-because-of-no-animal-control-officer/','Unknown','Two Unknown Police','1','0',1,0,0,3,3,'Uniform',3,3,0,0,0,0),(837,'2013-07-18','North Carolina','Winston-Salem','Winston-Salem Police Department',3,2,1,'Unconfirmed','A Winston-Salem police officer shot and killed a dog Thursday after it and two other dogs acted aggressively, police said.

The veterinarian reported she will fully recover and should not have any complications, Davis said. Cora, a $13,000 department asset who was purchased in 2011 with a grant, received medication and will be off duty for 2 weeks while she heals, the chief said. She is about 2 years old and the department&#039;s only K-9. She is used to detect drugs and explosives and locate suspects, missing people or objects. A member of the Southeast Mississippi Metropolitan Enforcement Team accidentally shot her, Davis said, while executing a search warrant at about 7:30 p.m. at a home on Woodlawn Avenue, on the west side of the city. Prior to the search warrant, agents had learned there were vicious dogs at the residence, the chief said. &quot;As the members of the team entered the targeted residence and made contact with the targets of the investigation, K-9 officer Cora broke away from the handler and ran into the residence,&quot; Davis said in a statement. &quot;K-9 officer Cora mistakenly attacked 1 of the plain clothed narcotics agents and bit him on the leg.&quot; The agent thought he was being attacked by a vicious animal, Davis said, so he fired a round.

Mike McKnight obtained surveillance video of the incident for a Fact Finders exclusive. On October 7th, after midnight, police blocked a street in the area of 35th and Vinton to look for an armed suspect. They say Chris Schulte, who lives in the area, ignored orders to stop and walked the family dog toward the search area. He was arrested and his dog, Teela, shot. Chris Schulte said, &ldquo;You know I should have got back but I was just walking on. Not threatening, dog wasn&#039;t being aggressive.&rdquo; In the report by Officer Schuster and Officer Clement, the officers said &ldquo;suspect&rsquo;s dog became aggressive, growled at officers, and showed its teeth before being shot and killed.&rdquo; Tim Wagner told Channel 6 News he watched the incident, live, from inside his home via a night vision security camera. Wagner said, &ldquo;The dog didn&#039;t stand a chance. The dog did nothing aggressive. I&#039;ve lived next to this dog two and a half years and it&rsquo;s one of the best dogs.&rdquo; Fact Finders checked with the Nebraska Humane Society. Teela, a Labrador, golden retriever mix, had a clean record with no history of bites or vicious behavior. Schulte says Teela belonged to his aunt, Michelle Meadows. Meadows said, &ldquo;It was very shocking. I would think they would maybe taser her or something, if they thought she was being aggressive, but I don&#039;t think she was.&rdquo; The police report described Schulte as intoxicated. He was arrested, at the scene, for obstructing police and resisting arrest.

Serna and Morales said they went outside and the officer approached them saying there had been a 911 call about a deceased woman. Morales then said the officer told him he was responding to the call from another family blocks away on another street, who had once lived in their house. Morales said the officer then told him 20 minutes later to check on his dog. According to Morales, the officer said, &ldquo;He trotted up to me after I turned the corner, came to my feet and I shot him.&rdquo; Morales said the officer described how he told the pit bull to get back, and when he didn&rsquo;t, he stepped back and fired his service revolver. However, the officer admitted to Morales the pit bull never growled at him. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if he meant to go straight down between the eyes or the top of the head, but it went from the mouth down,&rdquo; Morales said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s heartbreaking.

At Michael Dadio&rsquo;s house on George Street, his girlfriend&rsquo;s kids played in the back yard while his dad mowed the lawn. Then the cops showed up. They killed the family dog, tasered Michael Dadio Sr. and then arrested him &mdash; all because he didn&rsquo;t show up to court on DUI charges. (Dadio Sr. was not available for comment.) This overreaction by two East Haven police officers &mdash; in front of children &mdash; has upset neighbors on a street where many families own dogs. &ldquo;The way this happened was totally reckless,&rdquo; says Dadio Jr. He says he went to the police to complain and was told, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a dog.&rdquo; The shooting happened in May while the Department of Justice (DOJ) was investigating EHPD on complaints of racial profiling of Latinos. The DOJ&rsquo;s final report is expected sometime in July. The sergeant who killed the dog was the same one who signed off on the highly controversial arrest of a priest last year, which ignited national news coverage of complaints from area Latinos and the subsequent DOJ investigation. Dadio&rsquo;s story differs from the official police record. (The priest&rsquo;s account also differed from the police report in that 2009 case.) According to officer Jason Zullo&rsquo;s report, on May 22, he drove by the George Street home and &ldquo;immediately recognized Michael Dadio standing in front of his [son&rsquo;s] residence.&rdquo; Zullo knew Dadio had an arrest warrant for skipping court. (That&rsquo;s a misdemeanor. According to the state judicial website, Dadio has no convictions.) Sgt. John Miller and Zullo approached the house. &ldquo;Dadio immediately ran from officers in an attempt to elude capture when he saw the police vehicles arrive,&rdquo; according to the report. Zullo writes that Dadio ran to the back yard and Miller followed. Zullo went around the other side of the house. &ldquo;As officers gave chase, Sgt. Miller was confronted by an aggressive dog/pit bull forcing him to discharge his weapon,&rdquo; says the report. The report does not say that the dog chased, lunged at, intimidated or bit either of the officers. The back door to the house was wide open, says the report, and Dadio Sr. wasn&rsquo;t seen anywhere in the yard, so officers went inside to look for him and found him &ldquo;inside a cabinet under the kitchen sink.&rdquo; Then they tasered him after shouting at him to comply. Dadio says there&rsquo;s no way his dad would fit under the kitchen sink, and, there was no reason to taser him. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a harmless guy. My dad didn&rsquo;t even know there was a warrant for his arrest.&rdquo; Dadio admits that his dad ran from the cops. But that&rsquo;s because they got out of the police car with their guns drawn, he says. Dadio was outside next door and says he saw what happened. He says his dad went towards the back of the house, where the children were playing. The family&rsquo;s two dogs were barking, but are very well trained and both went through obedience school, he says. The German shepherd was on the back porch barking at the cops, when it was shot in front of the kids, who Dadio estimates were about 25 feet away. &ldquo;They could have killed the kids,&rdquo; says Dadio. After the shooting and the arrest, Dadio says more cops arrived. They blocked off the street and didn&rsquo;t let anyone enter the home for hours. Meanwhile, standing in the street, Dadio could hear his dog crying. He was so freaked out and upset, he says, that he left. The dog bled to death. The kids were so traumatized, says Dadio, that they wouldn&rsquo;t sleep at the house for days. Dadio is planning on filing a lawsuit. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not expecting any money, but I want something done to the officer. Suspend him or something.&rdquo; Neither Miller nor Zullo have been suspended, but an internal investigation is ongoing, says interim chief Gaetano Nappi. Several neighbors filed civilian complaints about the shooting, Nappi confirmed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d rather not harm anybody,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;If in fact [the shooting] was justifiable, it&rsquo;s an unfortunate circumstance of us doing our job.&rdquo;','http://www.informationliberation.com/?id=31241','Unknown','John Miller and Jason Zullo','1','0',1,0,0,1,1,'Uniform',1,2,0,0,2,0),(845,'2009-03-12','Texas','Bruceville-Eddy','Bruceville-Eddy Police Department and McLennan County Sheriff&#039;s Office',1,2,1,'Unconfirmed','Family members were demanding answers Friday after officers killed a dog and then used a Taser to subdue the dog&rsquo;s elderly owner for refusing to obey a command to stop, only to learn afterward that the man was deaf and likely didn&rsquo;t hear the order.\r\nThe dog was one of two that chased a Bruceville-Eddy woman into her home and wouldn&rsquo;t let her come out late Thursday afternoon.

The incident occurred about 4:44 p.m. Friday near the north end of the park at 132 S. Grove Ave.\r\nOfficers had already been tracking reports of two stray dogs on the city&#039;s near east side for 20 to 30 minutes when the dogs were spotted at the park. Elgin Police Lt. Matt Udelhoven said two boys were walking down a sidewalk when one of the dogs that was laying in the grass bit a boy on his left hand and wrist area and started scratching at his back. When one of the responding officers moved forward to interrupt the attack, the dog then turned from the boy and lunged toward the officer, who shot it. The second dog then began circling the officers and lunged toward the second officer, who then shot it, police said. Both animals were taken to the Dundee Animal Hospital and later euthanized, Udelhoven said. The boy, from Elgin, was treated for minor injuries to his hand and released to his family with the understanding they would take him to receive medical treatment, Udelhoven said. The dogs&#039; owner later was identified but was nowhere near the dogs throughout the incident, added Sgt. Dennis Hood. The owner has been cooperating with police&#039;s ongoing investigation into whether any ordinances were violated, Hood said.

Another pit bull was in its owner&#039;s backyard and was attacked by the loose dog, police said.\r\nChristian Diaz, 19, of the 300 block of South Weston Avenue, is the owner of the attacking pit bull and was bit by his own dog trying to break up the fight, police said. Lt. Glenn Theriault said when Diaz couldn&#039;t break the dogs up, he asked police to shoot his animal, which they did, killing the dog for everyone else&#039;s safety. The second pit bull was injured in the dogfight and taken to an animal hospital for treatment, police said. Charges are pending against Diaz for his dog&#039;s behavior. Diaz, who has multiple dogs, has already been found liable seven times in the last two months for animal complaints, according to Theriault. The most recent complaint against the dog that was shot was decided in an Elgin animal control hearing Feb. 14 and involved the same family whose dog was attacked Monday, Theriault said.

The spokeswoman said it was unclear from police reports how long the family had owned the dog or if it previously had displayed aggressive behavior. Eight puppies were taken by police to area shelters, Olafson said.

Craig Steurer heard the cries for help as he arrived at a South Elgin home after responding to a 911 call of a dog attack. &quot;It sounded bad to me,&quot; he said of the radio call he heard Saturday afternoon. &quot;It just wasn&#039;t the normal bite and let go.&quot;Steurer eventually had to shoot to death a pit bull that was attacking a woman and had already bitten her young nephew. The dog belonged to the woman&#039;s roommate but had been living in the home for only about a week after its original owner moved from the area, Steurer said. When Steurer arrived at the home in the 0-99 block of Churchill Court, he walked in through the garage and heard the cries, which led him upstairs. &quot;I turned and looked. There was a medium-size brown pit bull,&quot; he said. The dog&#039;s mouth was clamped on the 41-year-old woman&#039;s forearm. She &quot;was covered head to toe in smeared blood,&quot; Steurer said. The dog was &quot;actively chewing and pulling on her right arm. I was thinking, what am I going to do to get this dog off of her?&quot; Steurer said he grabbed the dog by its neck, which caused it to let go of the woman. &quot;He dug his feet in, turned his head &hellip; toward me and growled,&quot; Steurer said. Fearing another attack, Steurer said he decided to shoot the dog. At that point, other officers had arrived and tended to the woman, who was taken to Provena St. Joseph Hospital in Elgin and later transported to Advocate Lutheran General Hospital in Park Ridge. Officers also found the woman&#039;s 5-year-old nephew and 11-year-old niece in a bedroom. Steurer said the dog first attacked the boy and then turned on the woman after she intervened. The boy&#039;s sister brought him into a bedroom, shut the door and called 911, Steurer said. The boy suffered bites to his arm and hand. The woman remains hospitalized but is expected to recover, according to Sgt. Mike Doty. Her nephew was also hospitalized but has been released. The family could not be reached for comment Wednesday afternoon. It&#039;s unclear what caused the dog to attack the boy. Steurer said it was not his first incident with a pit bull. Last September, he responded to a call with a colleague &mdash; one of the same officers who responded to Saturday&#039;s attack &mdash; and encountered two pit bulls. One of the dogs charged Steurer&#039;s fellow officer, biting her heel and armpit. In that case, Steurer said he felt &quot;helpless&quot; because he could not shoot the dog without injuring the officer. The officer shot and killed the dog while it was attacking her, Steurer said. &quot;That also went through my mind&quot; during Saturday&#039;s attack, he said. &quot;The damage these things can do.&quot; Since Saturday&#039;s attack, Steurer said he spoke with the woman&#039;s brother, who expressed his gratitude. &quot;It was several people coming together,&quot; Steurer said. &quot;Not just me.&quot;','http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-08-08/news/ct-met-south-elgin-pitbull-20120809_1_pit-bull-dog-attack-steurer','Unknown','Craig Steurer','1','0',1,1,0,0,0,'Uniform',1,2,0,0,0,0),(853,'2011-08-07','Illinois','Elgin','Elgin Police Department',1,2,1,'Unconfirmed','The following is based entirely on police statements: A different pit bull was shot in the 400 block of North Worth Avenue about 11 a.m. after police responded to reports of a loose dog, according to police department spokeswoman Sue Olafson.

Scoppettuolo said the two large dogs were friendly during the first few moments when 14-year-old Brandon Marchetti was inside the construction yard. But that suddenly changed and the animals attacked Marchetti without warning, Scoppettuolo said. The 12-year-old dialed 911 on his cellphone and frantically summoned help. Moments later, Revere Police Officer Mike Mullen, along with other officers and Revere firefighters, arrived on the scene to see both dogs mauling Marchetti, according to Revere police. Mullen fired at both dogs, hitting one in the leg and driving it away from Marchetti, Detective Sergeant Steven Pisano of the Revere police said last week. Firefighters sprayed the other dog with a fire hose, cut open the gate, allowing Mullen to climb the fence and carry the boy to safety, Pisano said. Marchetti was transported by ambulance to Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, according to Scoppettuolo&rsquo;s uncle, Richie Troville, who said he did not know the boy&rsquo;s condition. A hospital spokeswoman could not confirm Saturday whether Marchetti was at the hospital. Marchetti&rsquo;s parents could not be reached for comment Saturday. Pisano said Scoppettuolo told police Marchetti had scaled the fence by climbing a snow bank and jumping onto a retaining wall connected to the fence. Scoppettuolo told officers he stayed on the wall while Marchetti jumped down into the yard. The owner of the property has kept guard dogs in the yard for three decades, and in all that time police never received a complaint about him or the dogs, Pisano said. The yard was enclosed by a padlocked, 6-foot-high, chain-link fence topped with barbed wire, he said. Mullen was uninjured, police said. In the phone interview Saturday, Scoppettuolo said he and Marchetti often visited the dogs, named Bella and Sonny, while on walks around their neighborhood. But neither had ever before tried to enter the construction yard near the Northgate Shopping Center. Troville said his nephew remains deeply upset by witnessing the dogs suddenly turn on his best friend. &ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s still kind of distraught,&rdquo; Troville said. Troville said Marchetti and Scoppettuolo spend a lot of time together, looking for things to do in the neighborhood. They would routinely visit the dogs, feeding and petting them through the fence, Troville said. According to Troville, the owner had warned the boys to be cautious near the animals. &ldquo;He told them you need to stay away from the dogs,&rdquo; Troville said of the owner of the construction yard.

Officer Cerullo went to the scene and was able to distract the dog so that the man and his daughter could get out of their car and enter their home. He said that during that encounter, the dog charged him several times. Further, he said he was unable to locate the owner. About three hours later, around 8:15 a.m., Cerullo was called again to the same address because the dog was trying to attack another person, according to Beaulieu&rsquo;s memo.

Police were called to the township village of Brownsville, located west of Shenandoah, shortly before 8 a.m. about two dogs fighting on a front porch at 1301 W. Penn St. When Patrolman Ray Tonkinson arrived, he found a pit bull aggressively attacking a chocolate Labrador-pit bull mix. Both dogs were of similar size. &ldquo;The pit bull was ripping the other dog apart when I got there,&rdquo; Tonkinson said. &ldquo;The pit bull had to be put down.&rdquo; The owners of both dogs are Christopher Brown and Annie Hornberger, who also own three other dogs at that address. Tonkinson said no people were attacked during the incident. After the attacking dog was killed, the surviving dog was taken by the state dog warden to the Ringtown Valley Veterinarian Hospital, where it is being treated. Brown and Hornberger spoke of the incident and are sad about the loss of their female pit bull named Princess and the injuries to the other female dog named Bella. Both were acquired as rescue dogs and were about 2 to 3 years old, spayed and microchipped. &ldquo;I was at work and my girlfriend left out one of the dogs (Lab),&rdquo; Brown said. &ldquo;The other dog got out of the cage and they got in at it. She couldn&rsquo;t separate them, so the police were called. The police shot the pit bull and the other dog is at the vet.&rdquo; As for the Labrador&rsquo;s condition, Brown said, &ldquo;Right now she&rsquo;s staying for observation, but she should be able to pull through. They have her intravenously taking fluids. There are a couple of stitches in the mouth.&rdquo; Hornberger said that all five dogs are taken well care of, though two dogs have medical conditions. &ldquo;All my dogs have had their shots, including for rabies, and they all have food,&rdquo; Hornberger said. &ldquo;Because one dog has a skin condition and another has colitis, there are some people who say my dogs have rabies. The dog warden saw the records for the shots and the licenses, and if I didn&rsquo;t have them, I would have been fined and my other dogs would have been taken away from me.&rdquo; Hornberger said that there wasn&rsquo;t much she could do in separating the dogs. &ldquo;There are neighbors here who wanted me to separate two pit bulls and keep three other dogs tame plus keep my five-year-old son away from the fight,&rdquo; Hornberger said. &ldquo;What am I going to do at 90 pounds against two dogs? I can only do so much, and I think I did what I could to protect my son and the other three dogs.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an animal lover, but I&rsquo;d rather see the animal get put down than have my stepson in the middle of it,&rdquo; Brown said. &ldquo;Maybe if I would had help during the first 20 minutes, I could have saved her (Princess),&rdquo; Hornberger said. &ldquo;It got started about 20 minutes after 7. When it got out of control, I just couldn&rsquo;t get her mouth open and get the other dog away. I was here screaming and crying for help.&rdquo; Hornberger usually lets each of the five dogs outside separately, but she said they all get along with each other. &ldquo;By the time I opened the front door, both of the dogs were out. Well, Bella jumps to play, so she started to play and the pit didn&rsquo;t know it,&rdquo; Hornberger said. &ldquo;I tried to calm them down.

Aldana lives with the owner of the dog, Daniel Shoaf, 28, who said he went to church Sunday morning and later dinner when the shooting happened. &quot;When I came home, everyone was like freaking out,&quot; Shoaf said. According to police, Officer Christopher Schoof pulled up to the home about 5:30 p.m. Sunday to serve an arrest warrant on a man, who based on information, might be at what the dispatcher called a &quot;party house.&quot; Police said Nero was tied to a cable in front of the home, but the dog&#039;s collar broke as it acted aggressively toward the officer. In his report, Schoof said the dog was growling and showing its teeth while charging at him. Schoof said he tried to retreat from the dog, but with, Nero continuing to come at him, he fired two shots. Aldana, who was sitting on the front porch beside Juanira Puentes, 22, said the first shot fired roughly 15 feet in front of them hit the dirt, but the second bullet struck Nero in the chest. &quot;It was crazy. I had never seen anything or anyone get shot. It was like in front of my face,&quot; Puentes said. Because Shoaf was not home, a neighbor drove Nero to the animal clinic at Purdue North Central near Westville where the dog died. Shoaf said an online petition asking for the officer to be terminated or resign has been signed by more than 500 people. Aldana wonders why the officer didn&#039;t use his Taser if he felt he was in danger and there were many people, including children, playing close to where the dog was shot. The officer had his gun pointed more toward the ground, but had any of the shots flown above of the dog someone on the porch could have been hit, Aldana said. &quot;He just didn&#039;t even think. Just boom, boom,&quot; Aldana said. LaPorte police Capt. Tom Heath said Tuesday no disciplinary action has been taken against the officer, but the matter is under review. Heath declined to make any preliminary judgements of the officer&#039;s actions, but said, &quot;contrary to how it&#039;s been represented in social media, most of us down here do have pets just like everyone else.&quot; &quot;It&#039;s unfortunate you have to do things you really don&#039;t want to do.

It happened last Wednesday in southeast Waxahachie when the animal suddenly appeared in a residential neighborhood.  Feathers on the ground are a mute reminder of where the bird met its end in Malcolm Brigman&rsquo;s yard. &ldquo;First thing I saw was that durn thing coming,&rdquo;  90-year-old Malcolm Brigman told CBS 11 News. He faced German soldiers in the Ardennes in World War II&mdash;and then a very tall challenge again last Wednesday in his own yard. &ldquo;It scared me, you know, when it come out,&rdquo; he said of the animal. Brigman was caught in the climax of a blocks-long chase of a stray emu. Fully grown emus can be 6-feet tall, weigh 150-pounds and run 55 miles an hour. &ldquo;These animals are extremely powerful,&rdquo; animal control officer Warren Howell told CBS 11 News. Howell, who had handled emus in the early 1990s,  had the animal under control once by sneaking up behind it. &ldquo;You always want to approach them from the rear. Because emus have hinged knees that lift up to the front they cannot strike hard to the rear.&rdquo; But he couldn&rsquo;t get it into his truck&rsquo;s dog-sized cage. &ldquo;It had different ideas about going into the truck. I lost my grip on it when it pushed off the tailgate.&rdquo; Howell and six other police and animal control officers tried herding and corralling it again when Brigman suddenly entered a danger zone. &ldquo;He stepped out of the shed directly in the path of the emu and there was nobody between him and the emu,&rdquo; Howell recalled. &quot;He &lsquo;rassled him and threw him down, but he couldn&rsquo;t hold him,&rdquo; Brigman said of Howell and the emu adding, &ldquo;And it kicked him upside the head, I think, and down his eye. And his stomach, arms.&rdquo; Howell picked up the story. &ldquo;There are 6-inch talons that come out the end of those feet and if those get into you they can cause serious damage,&rdquo; he said. He knew he and a fellow animal control officer were losing their battle to sit on and tie down the emu. Brigman feels Howell and the others had to act. &ldquo;And he knew that bird was fixing to get up from there, so he just stood there and told the police, &lsquo;Shoot him, shoot him.&#039;&rdquo; Police fired twice at Howell&rsquo;s instructions. &ldquo;The Waxahachie police officer needed to fire two shots to field euthanize the animal.&rdquo; Howell insists the choice  was either the emu or Brigman. &ldquo;Yes. We tried everything we could. It&rsquo;s a very beautiful, majestic animal. We wanted to do everything we could to secure the animal as best we could. But once the citizen was introduced into the situation it changed everything about the dynamics.&rdquo; No one knows who owned the emu.','http://dfw.cbslocal.com/2014/09/03/waxahachie-police-officer-shoots-emu-to-save-elderly-man/','Unknown','Warren Howell and unknown police and animal control (6)','1','0',0,0,0,3,3,'Uniform',3,3,0,0,0,0),(869,'2014-08-16','Minnesota','Atwater','Atwater Police Department-Patrol Bureau',1,1,0,'Chicken','An Atwater woman has filed a formal complaint against the Atwater Police Chief for trespassing on her property and killing her young son&rsquo;s pet chicken &ndash; leaving the hen&rsquo;s decapitated head just feet from the backyard chicken coop. Ashley Turnbull said she knows she violated the city&rsquo;s ordinance that prohibits fowl and acknowledges she was told Aug. 7 by police to remove the three chickens and two ducks. But she said Police Chief Trevor Berger went too far when he came onto her property about a week later, when nobody was home, and clubbed, killed and decapitated a small, red hen with a shovel. &ldquo;The chicken was like a puppy dog to my son,&rdquo; said Turnbull. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t do that to a puppy.&rdquo; Berger said he was simply enforcing the city ordinance that has been on the books since 1960 and was responding to a &ldquo;frustrated&rsquo; neighbor&rsquo;s repeated complaints, including a report on Aug. 16 that one of Turnbull&rsquo;s chickens was running loose in the residential area near the elementary school. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry it had to happen that way,&rdquo; said Berger, adding that he didn&rsquo;t intend to leave the severed chicken head in the yard to send a message to the homeowners. Berger said he thought the head was still attached to the chicken when he carried the carcass away.\r\nBerger said killing the chicken was justified. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s against city ordinance for a chicken to be in the city and running around in people&rsquo;s yards,&rdquo; he said. Turnbull said Berger didn&rsquo;t handle the situation professionally. &ldquo;I still feel he owes my son an apology and he owes us a chicken, said Turnbull, who filed a written complaint with the Atwater Police Commissioner on Aug. 20. She has not yet heard a response, but the issue is expected to be addressed Wednesday during the Atwater City Council meeting when, ironically, Berger said he intends to present a proposed ordinance to allow chickens in the city, that the council asked him to prepare earlier this year.\r\nThe situation started this spring when Turnball&rsquo;s five-year-old son, Phoenix, was given baby chickens and ducks as a birthday gift. &ldquo;He takes care of them,&rdquo; said Turnbull. &ldquo;He plays with them.&rdquo; Turnbull said she wasn&rsquo;t aware at the time the city didn&rsquo;t allow poultry. In May, another Atwater family who also had chickens, asked the city council to change the ordinance. City Clerk Goldie Smith said she was in the process of researching chicken ordinances when Turnbull&rsquo;s neighbor, Dick Rierson, brought pictures of Turnbull&rsquo;s muddy poultry pen to the August city council meeting.\r\nSmith said the council decided at that point to inform Turnbull, and other residents who had chickens, to remove them. In an interview with the West Central Tribune, Rierson said he was concerned about having chickens in town living &ldquo;in filth like that&rdquo; and that he feared it would attract rats. Rierson said the chickens &ldquo;were probably nice pets, but you have to keep it clean.&rdquo; He seemed surprised to learn that the police chief had killed one of the chickens. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not for mistreating any animal,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not for killing a chicken for the sake of killing a chicken.&rdquo;\r\nBut Rierson said the ordinance prohibiting livestock was put in place for a reason and if killing the chicken was the only way for the police chief to address the problem, &ldquo;then I&rsquo;d say he&rsquo;s doing his job.&rdquo; Berger said when he got the call on Aug. 16, he saw the chicken in a yard next to Turnbull&rsquo;s house. He said he tried for 10-15 minutes to catch the chicken or chase it back into the pen. &ldquo;I feel like I made a good effort to get it back in,&rdquo; he said. But when the other two chickens and two ducks in the fenced pen started to get out, Berger said he closed the door that he&rsquo;d opened, grabbed a shovel leaning against Turnbull&rsquo;s garage and &ldquo;dispatched&rdquo; the chicken. Since there were children playing in the adjacent yard, Berger said he didn&rsquo;t want to use his gun to kill the chicken and the shovel was the &ldquo;safest way to dispatch it.&rdquo; When asked why it was necessary to kill the young chicken instead of letting it be, Berger said the family was &ldquo;not supposed to have them in the first place&rdquo; and that he wanted to give the aggrieved neighbor &ldquo;some results.&rdquo; It was the same process he would use if there was a report of a skunk, he said. &ldquo;I guess I don&rsquo;t regret it, because it&rsquo;s like taking care of any rodent in town,&rdquo; he said. Turnbull said she doesn&rsquo;t understand that logic. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t perceive a chicken being a threat to anybody,&rdquo; said Turnbull. Turnbull&rsquo;s neighbor, Jason Shoutz, said he saw Berger walked up to the chicken by the coop and swing the shovel &ldquo;up and down.&rdquo; His young daughter was in the yard at the time and saw the officer kill the chicken. Berger said he left no note on the door and although he intended to initiate contact the family after killing the chicken, he did not. Shoutz informed Turnbull and her fianc&eacute;, Chris Gordon, about what happened. Gordon said he called the police chief later that day. &ldquo;I said, so you came to our home and killed our chicken with our shovel?&rdquo; said Gordon, retelling the  conversation. &ldquo;He said, &lsquo;Yup. Any questions?&rsquo; That&rsquo;s the thing that makes me mad.&rdquo; The situation has been the talk of the town for a while, but Berger said &ldquo;most of the people think it&rsquo;s rather silly.&rdquo; When asked what was silly, he responded, &ldquo;That there&rsquo;s such uproar about a chicken.&rdquo; Berger said that after advising city council members what had happened, he was instructed not to take immediate action regarding Turnbull&rsquo;s remaining poultry. Turnbull is upset with the police chief but she also blames herself for not taking the city&rsquo;s initial warning seriously. She said she discounted the verbal warning, in part because she never received anything in writing about removing the animals and because of the upcoming vote on the ordinance. She said it didn&rsquo;t make sense to move the animals to a farm for a couple weeks with the possibility they could eventually be legal in town. Berger said he believes the other families who had poultry in town removed their animals after being instructed to do so. Atwater Mayor Mark Olson declined to comment for the story. He said both sides of the issue, which he called the &ldquo;chicken fiasco&rdquo;, would be discussed at the council meeting this Wednesday. Turnbull said she intends to be at that meeting and is still hoping the council agrees to adopt an ordinance so her son can keep his remaining chickens and ducks.','http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/weird/2014/09/02/officer-decapitates-pet-chicken/14979133/','Unknown','Police Chief Trevor Berger','0','0',1,0,0,0,2,'Not Sure',0,3,0,0,0,0),(870,'2012-07-31','California','Colton','Colton Police Department, San Bernardino Sheriffs Department',1,2,0,'Unconfirmed','On July 31, 2012, the Los Angeles stations didn&rsquo;t have their choppers flying anywhere near enough to San Bernardino County to catch the police pursuit that began in Colton. If they had, there&rsquo;s a strong chance they&rsquo;d have caught another chase that ended badly, this time for 21-year-old Trevor Michael Taylor. Colton Police Sgt. Steve Davis was running a regular patrol when he spotted a green Honda Civic just before 11:15am, near the intersection of 9th and H streets. Knowing that Civics get stolen quite a bit in California and just about everywhere else, Davis radioed dispatchers to see if the car was stolen. The Civic came back stolen, the day before from Rancho Cucamonga, according to a report released by the San Bernardino County District Attorney&rsquo;s Office. Davis called for backup as he continued to trail the car. Two officers&mdash;Sgt. Lou Gamache and Officer Todd Smith&mdash;fell in behind Davis, following the Civic as it traveled on Auto Plaza Way, over the 215 Freeway into San Bernardino. Davis tried to pull the car over as it reached E Street, heading east. That&rsquo;s when the pursuit began. The officers chased the car for 21 minutes, according to the prosecutors&rsquo; report. The driver of the Civic pushed the small car as fast as 80 mph down city surface streets. Prosecutors allege the car almost struck an elderly, cane-wielding pedestrian. Davis tried to use a PIT maneuver four times to stop the Civic, to no avail. He lost control of his patrol car after the fourth try, with Smith taking over the lead role in the chase. As the Civic sped south on San Francisco Street, Smith tried a PIT maneuver, this time with success. The Civic spun around and the officers boxed it in with their patrol cars. Gamache saw straight into the Civic&rsquo;s driver&rsquo;s side window as it aligned with his own and he got a look at the driver for the first time&mdash;it was Taylor. Smith got out of his patrol car and approached the Civic with his gun drawn. He ordered Taylor take his foot off the gas and keep his hands in plain sight. Gamache, still looking at Taylor through his open window, also had his gun trained on the man. Gamache told investigators that he saw Taylor mouth, &ldquo;OK,&rdquo; as he held his hands in the air. Suddenly, Taylor dropped his hands and quickly leaned forward. Gamache thought Taylor was going for a gun. So did Smith. Both officers fired a barrage of shots at almost the same time, according to prosecutors. Taylor slumped over in his seat, dead. A search of the Civic revealed he had no weapon. Instead, officers found a large dog in the car. The animal sustained a gunshot wound to the paw. As is common for many police departments, Colton elected to have the county sheriff&rsquo;s department investigate the officer-involved shooting as a homicide, to avoid any possible accusations of conflicts of interest. Detective Mauricio Hurtado handled the investigation for the San Bernardino County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department. Hurtado took statements from at least three witnesses, none of whom felt the officers used unnecessary force in shooting Taylor. One witness told Hurtado that she felt the officers gave Taylor every opportunity to surrender without being shot. An autopsy report showed that Taylor was struck by 13 bullets fired from two different guns. Many of them struck him in the head and chest. Toxicology reports showed he had amphetamine and methamphetamine in his system when he died. The District Attorney&rsquo;s Office cleared Gamache and Smith of any wrongdoing, saying both officers acted in self-defense. A year after the shooting, Taylors parents brought a Federal lawsuit against the police officers involved, the police chief, and the city. Taylor et al, v City of Colton Case Number 5&#58;13&#45;cv&#45;01330&#45;PSG&#45;AJW.

According to the Sonniers, when the alarm went off, the monitoring company called the contact list, including Michelle Sonnier, a nurse practitioner who was with a patient at the time. Her husband Matt was also unable to answer, so they called Michelle&rsquo;s mother, next on the list. She then called Matt &ndash; he was able to answer this time &ndash; who called the alarm company and told them it was a false alarm- all of this happened within 9 minutes time. About thirty minutes later, Michelle arrived at home, coming in through the garage  entrance in back, and saw the commotion outside. She went out to get the mail and that&rsquo;s when police asked where she came from and told her that they had shot their dog inside their fenced backyard.\r\nA statement from Lafayette Police reads: On Monday, January 7, 2013, at approximately 12:20 pm, Lafayette Police responded to a residence in the 200 block of Montauban Drive regarding an alarm activation at a residence. Two Lafayette Police Officers arrived on the scene and began checking the perimeter of the residence. The two officers entered into the backyard that was surrounded by a fence. As officers moved in the direction of the back of the home, a large dog approached them in an aggressive manner. Both officers fired one shot, killing the dog. The officers were not injured during the incident. The incident is being investigated by the Lafayette Police Department&rsquo;s Internal Affairs Section, which is standard procedure when an officer discharges a firearm.','http://999ktdy.com/family-pet-shot-in-lafayette-backyard-by-police-on-house-alarm-call/','Jean','Two Unknown Police','2','0',0,0,0,0,0,'Uniform',1,2,0,0,2,0),(880,'2011-12-22','Louisiana','Lafayette','Lafayette Parish Sheriff&#039;s Office',3,50,0,'Boxer','The Lafayette Parish Sheriff&#039;s Office says a dog bit a deputy who was investigating a report that a dog had bitten an 8-year-old boy.

Gutierrez forced the Barboza family to tie their labrador mix Bobby to a pole in their front yard. Gutierrez then proceeded to shoot Bobby three times with a rifle retrieved from his squad car. Gutierrez killed the dog in front of the Barboza&#039;s three year old daughter, as well as several children who looked on from their school bus stop directly in front of the Barboza family home. Gutierrez justified the killing based on three complaints filed by a neighbor of the Barbozas in five days, who police describe as &quot;mentally disabled.&quot; The neighbor&#039;s first two reports allege that Bobby broke into the neighbor&#039;s home and &quot;ripped a shirt&quot;. The neighbor stated that she knew it was the labrador despite the fact she had not witnessed any such events. When police failed to act based on the neighbor&#039;s outlandish claims, she escalated - instead of saying the Bobby had ripped a shirt, the third complaint alleged that Bobby was in fact a &quot;vicious pit bull&quot; that &quot;went after&quot; her daughter. 45 minutes after receiving this last fanciful allegation, Gutierrez was killing Bobby in front of a pack of children. Two weeks after the shooting, the Barboza family has filed a quarter million dollar lawsuit and Gutierrez is suspended from the police force. Here is how Jackson Hole News &amp; Guide reports the events:  Bobby, the dog shot three times 14 days ago by a Teton County, Idaho, Sheriff&#039;s Deputy and the center of a lawsuit, is currently at the veterinarian and may undergo surgery today. &quot;We hope the vet will be able to sew up his wounds,&quot; said Joshua A. Garner, attorney for the dog&#039;s owner, the Barboza family of Felt, Idaho.\r\nThe shooting, which drew national and regional attention, occurred when deputy Joseph W. Gutierrez responded to a call from a neighbor accusing the 5-year-old mutt of vicious behavior Nov. 12. The Barboza family alleges that Gutierrez arrived with the express purpose of killing their dog. Gutierrez has been suspended, pending a completed investigation. The Barbozas filed a civil tort claim for $250,000, the cap for non-economic damages, against Teton County on Nov. 21. &quot;The Deputy&#039;s actions were cruel, inhumane, outrageous and unlawful,&quot; the claim says. &quot;More than anything, we are looking for accountability as well as an apology from the sheriff&#039;s office,&quot; Garner said. In a press release, the sheriff&#039;s office justified Gutierrez&#039;s actions according to a county ordinance that says if a vicious animal cannot be safely impounded, then it may be destroyed. The press release referenced details from several reports made by a neighbor who alleged misbehavior and attacks by the dog.\r\nThe release also labeled Bobby a dangerous breed that the Barbozas failed to register and restrain within their yard. &quot;This is an unfortunate event which has occurred. Teton County Sheriff&#039;s Office is considering it a learning experience that we can learn from and improved policy and procedures in deal [sic] vicious animals,&quot; the release says. The attorney for the Barboza family disagreed. &quot;They are trying to spin this and make it look like the dog owner&#039;s fault,&quot; Garner said, &quot;when in reality you have a deputy who shot this dog three times without proof and no warrant.&quot; The release, issued Monday, said the shooting was in accordance with Section 8 and 11.4 of the Teton County Ordinances. According to the release, Section 8 says &quot;that if any vicious animal so found at large cannot be safely taken up and impounded, such dog may be destroyed by the Animal Care and Control Officer or Teton County Sheriff&#039;s Office.&quot; The release&#039;s reasoning included references to the dog as a pitbull - a breed deemed too dangerous to be accepted by the Idaho Humane Society - and previous allegations of aggression, all made by a neighbor. It also highlighted the Barboza family&#039;s response to the shooting. Garner was outraged by the statement. &quot;I don&#039;t think the Teton County Sheriff&#039;s Office is taking this seriously,&quot; he said. The Teton County Sheriff&#039;s Office logged three incident reports all made by the same neighbor against Bobby within five days. The sheriff&#039;s office press release described the neighbor as &quot;mentally disabled.&quot; The first, filed Nov. 8, reported: &quot;neighbor&#039;s dog ripped shirt.&quot; Deputy Tim Scheer arrived in Felt at 3:52 p.m. and left at 4:09 p.m. Two days later, the same resident filed a claim that she returned home to find a ripped shirt. &quot;The dog next door did it,&quot; the report reads, &quot;[the reporting party] did not witness this.&quot; The shooting occurred Nov. 12. The report, filed at 2:55 p.m., details that a &quot;vicious pit bull went after [reporting party&#039;s] daughter.&quot; The daughter made it inside, unharmed. Gutierrez was dispatched at 3 p.m. and arrived on the scene at 3:38 p.m. Ten minutes later, he logged: &quot;Shots fired. Dog is dead.&quot; He cleared the scene at 4:07 p.m. The tort claim offers the following account of events from Leo Barboza&#039;s point of view: Gutierrez demanded to see Bobby, saying he was there to kill him and did not need to provide proof that the dog had bitten or attacked anyone. He instructed Barboza to bring Bobby outside and tie him to a pole, while he retrieved his rifle from his vehicle. Barboza pleaded for his dog&#039;s life. Gutierrez fired three shots, one through the dog&#039;s neck and two in his head. Barboza&#039;s father-in-law, wife and 3-year-old son witnessed the event. According to reports, a school bus unloaded a group of children moments before the shooting. They all stood on the street and witnessed it. Barboza moved Bobby to the dog&#039;s usual hideout under the trailer, Garner said. The Nov. 12 incident report continued with three entries the following night, when Barboza&#039;s father-in-law suffered an anxiety attack, deemed stress-induced by his doctor. An ambulance was called, with a request made for a reporting officer other than Gutierrez. The family returned  Nov. 14 to find Bobby alive. The sheriff&#039;s office press release highlights the Barbozas&#039; delayed treatment of their dog as negligent. Cooke declined to discuss details of the incident because it was under investigation, but he echoed the press release by saying that the county must learn from the shooting. &quot;The problem is going to continue to grow,&quot; he said, &quot;the county is going to have to step up and make some changes.&quot; Among the reforms, he said, they will examine deputies&#039; training on handling aggressive animals. The sheriff&#039;s office recruited Gutierrez from out-of-state for his bilingual skills less than a year ago, prior to his certification, said Teton County Sheriff Kim Cooke. Cooke said Gutierrez had just returned from Peace Officer Standards and Training as a Detention Officer in Boise, Idaho. Cooke said Gutierrez had been a Marine. Gutierrez has been suspended following the shooting, the second recent suspension of a Teton County deputy. There are currently six active deputies. &quot;It puts us down a bit,&quot; Cooke said. &quot;We need more help.&quot; He said the high cost of living made recruitment and retention of deputies difficult in Teton County.\r\nThe Teton County Sheriff&#039;s Office has received multiple threats following the incident. KIDK, a CBS affiliate in Idaho Falls, Idaho, broke the story with video of Bobby&#039;s gaping wounds Nov. 20, igniting public indignation nationwide. Reports ran on CNN and The Drudge Report, among other media sources. &quot;There&#039;s so many people who think they know the story,&quot; Cooke said. &quot;It&#039;s pretty easy to make a decision when you don&#039;t have to make them.&quot;','http://www.jhnewsandguide.com/archives/idaho-dog-survives-shots-fired-by-sheriff-s-deputy/article_e4962057-9c41-55eb-aac8-42ce400d1f01.html','Bobby','Joseph W.

When asked why he shot the helpless puppy, the shooter replied: &ldquo;Yeah, I shot the dog. What the fuck you gonna do about it?&rdquo; The cop&#039;s question was answered recently with two lawsuits against the city of Harvey and its police in relation to the incident. Here is how the events were reported: The city of Harvey is currently facing two lawsuits from a December incident in which officers shot a man in the leg without cause, shot and killed a witness&rsquo;s puppy, and threatened a witness. Harvey, a far south suburb of Chicago, has a median income and home value of about half the statewide median. The population is 90 percent black and Latino. Paul Manning claims officers in a squad car followed him as he walked down a street on December 30. As described in the lawsuit, the officers stopped their car and told Manning to &ldquo;come here&rdquo;; Manning, however, who was unarmed and had done nothing wrong, kept walking. As he kept walking away from the squad car, Manning slipped and fell. When he tried to get up, one of the officers shot Manning in the back of the leg. After Manning fell yet again, the officers fired still more shots at him. While Manning was lying on the ground, one of the officers stood on the man&rsquo;s back and handcuffed him. A nearby witness tried to record the incident on his cell phone. The officer, however, grabbed the witness&rsquo;s cell phone and threw it while, as Manning describes in the lawsuit, saying, &ldquo;You touch the phone, I will shoot the shit out of you.&rdquo; Meanwhile, Karnischa Miller heard gunshots and opened the back door to witness, as she claims, &ldquo;a young man, Paul Manning, lying on the ground after having been shot. He was screaming and asking for an ambulance.&rdquo; Her 14-week puppy Nemo ran out through the open door. An officer yelled to Miller&rsquo;s boyfriend to come get the dog, but as LeShon Wright advanced to follow the order, an officer raised his gun towards Wright and the dog. Wright stopped in his tracks, but the dog kept walking towards the officer. Although Nemo &ldquo;did not growl, bark, or act aggressively in any way&rdquo;, the officer shot the puppy. The city of Harvey has admitted that the officers shot Miller&rsquo;s dog. Miller claims that the officer&rsquo;s response was, &ldquo;Yeah, I shot the dog. What the fuck you gonna do about it?&rdquo; Miller claims that she and her children were so disturbed by Nemo&rsquo;s brutal murder, and from &ldquo;being forced to helplessly watch him die&rdquo;, that they moved from Harvey to Wisconsin. She is now suing the city of Harvey, Officer James Sinnot, and Officer Davres on the grounds of excessive force, illegal seizure, failure to intervene, and emotional distress. Manning, who has sued the city of Harvey, Officer Sinnot, and Officer O&rsquo;Shea, is seeking punitive damages for excessive force, battery, and emotional distress.','http://www.opposingviews.com/i/society/harvey-ill-police-shoot-unarmed-man-threaten-shoot-shit-out-witness','Nemo','James Sinnot, Davres and O&rsquo;Shea','2','0',1,0,1,2,2,'Uniform',0,0,2,0,1,0),(883,'2012-09-02','New York','New York','NYPD',1,1,0,'Parakeet','A situation propagated by NYPD police escalated to violent levels for Evelyn Lugo&#039;s family on September 2, 2012 - an event that is now the center of a lawsuit in Brooklyn Federal Court. Ortega et al v. City of New York et al Case Number 1:2013cv06646 Filed November 29, 2013 New York Eastern District Court. Evelyn is pictured above. Despite the focus of the title, this unnecessary event is all around tragic for its violence and destruction towards an innocent family. The Staten Island mom of 10 recounts the Labor Day barbecue gathering among some of her grown children. Lugo&#039;s son Edwin Avellanet, age 26, was taking garbage out when cops did a &#039;stop-and-question&#039; about an orange cone nearby to reserve a parking spot for family members. They demanded to see identification and he refused saying he had done nothing wrong. A cop grabbed him by the arm but he retracted his arm and went into the house. City cops busted several windows. When Lugo opened the door to see what was happening, cops barged into her home, busting the door - no warrant of course - and beat up her family and their friends, using batons on the victims&#039; faces. Grandchildren were among the victims traumatized by the pepper spray used in the St. George home. A daughter allegedly had an asthma attack from the plume. The pet parakeet was ejected from its cage after commotion from the cops knocked it off a dresser. Lugo&#039;s daughter, Anna Febles, says she screamed &quot;The bird!&quot; when the officer said &quot;F--- the bird&quot; and stepped on it, killing it. Lugo says: &quot;They threw me like a piece of garbage on the floor.&quot; Backup cops arrived to barge in and look for Avellanet. As per the usual MO, the victims were arrested and initially faced criminal charges. Then those charges were dropped but there has been no retribution for the family, nor disciplinary action towards the cops involved. Evelyn reports being sick, depressed and heartbroken since the incident. Their attorney, Jason Leventhal, helping them in the suit alleging unlawful search and seizure, excessive force and malicious prosecution, said: &quot;It was completely uncalled for.&quot; Evelyn pulls it all into perspective when she says: &quot;They [the police] don&rsquo;t care about us as humans, they&rsquo;re going to care about the bird?&quot;','http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nypd-killed-parakeet-staten-island-mom-article-1.1541112','Tito','Charles Drobness, Ralph Conde, Thomas Nigro, Mary Gillespie and Unknown Police','0','0',1,0,2,1,1,'Uniform',0,0,2,2,1,2),(884,'2013-09-27','Tennessee','Mountain City','Mountain City Police Force',1,1,0,'Squirrel','It sounds nuts, but a Tennessee police officer has been kicked off the force after a run-in with a squirrel. Jody Putnam was fired from the Mountain City Police Force after a Sept. 27 incident where he shot his gun at the unnamed squirrel, which had found its way into the Dollar General store. Animal control was called to help get rid of the rascally rodent, but when that officer was unavailable, Putnam answered the call of duty instead. Putnam tried to apprehend his squirrelly suspect by shooting his gun inside the store, according to property owner Carl Duffield.\r\n&quot;Shooting back there, of course that should not have been, that should not have happened. Then they began to spray it with mace and pepper spray.&quot; Duffield told WJHL-TV. &quot;There was a lot of people that come out and just like me they came out and they were coughing and a hacking. It was comical, but I&#039;m sure they didn&#039;t feel that way, the customers that came out.&quot; It is unknown how many shots Putnam fired, and Dollar General store officials have refused to release the surveillance tape. When bystanders were allowed back in the store, they saw the dead squirrel pinned under his shoe, the Mountain City Tomahawk reported. In Mountain City, officers are required to make a written statement to their supervisor whenever they fire a weapon.\r\nPutnam, an officer with nearly two decades of experience, refused to explain his squirrel shooting, so he was fired by the town&#039;s Board of Mayor and Alderman, according to WBIR. &quot;The decision the City Council made on this incident speaks for itself,&rdquo; Mountain City Mayor Lawrence Keeble told the Tomahawk.

Its relationship to reality is dubious: On April 25th just before midnight, two South Precinct bicycle officers were contacting several people in an alley behind a tavern (4900 Block Rainier Ave. South) when an intoxicated male approached them and began interferring with their investigation. At one point the suspect grabbed one of the officer&rsquo;s bike in an attempt to distract them. When the officer responded toward the suspect, who is described as 6&rsquo;06&Prime;, 300 pounds, took up a fighting stance and said, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s fight!&rdquo;  Officers immediately ordered the suspect to the ground. He refused, and thrust his hands into his pockets. The officer then attempted to use pepper spray on the suspect and take him into custody. The suspect was able to shake off the officer and run up a flight of stairs into an apartment.  The officers requested additional officers respond to the scene. At that point, the officers were still out with the four individuals in the alley. They made the decision to release those individuals and began to move toward the stairs. At that point, the suspect began throwing metal items at them from above, nearly striking the officers and people below.  The officers approached the suspect&rsquo;s apartment to where they could hear a dog barking/growling on the other side of the door. The officers announced their presence and told the suspect to secure his dog. The suspect then sent the dog into the hallway at the officers. The dog subsequently retreated back into the apartment and the officers told the suspect to secure the dog yet again. At that point the officers heard the suspect tell the dog to &ldquo;get &lsquo;em!&rdquo; and the dog charged them.  One of the officers was not able to retreat any further due to the size of the landing.  When the dog got close enough to bite him, the officer had no other option but to fire two shots at the dog, killing it. The officers then ordered the suspect onto the ground. The suspect refused and was tased by one of the officers. The suspect was then taken into custody. The suspect was later taken to Harborview Medical Center for evaluation due to his intoxication. The 42 year old suspect will be booked later into the King County Jail for Investigation of Assault and Investigation of Harassment.

Metro spokesman Officer Marcus Martin said the chimp that was killed was shot by an officer after it appeared the chimp was headed toward residents, including children, who had come outside to watch the chase. A 911 call at 10:13 a.m. alerted officers to the escaped chimpanzees near Ann Road and Jones Boulevard. Live-streamed video of the ensuing chase showed multiple Metro Police and animal control units involved in the hunt for the chimps, each of which weighed upwards of 170 pounds. The chimpanzees, one male and one female, had escaped from a residence on the 5700 block of Rowland Avenue, Martin said. Neighbors said the chimpanzees appeared agitated and felt they were going to be attacked. One of the chimpanzees climbed on top of a woman&rsquo;s car and tried to open her door. At one point, one of the chimps had climbed onto a police car and was banging on it, Martin said. When one chimpanzee &mdash; the male &mdash; was about to enter a neighborhood area where neighbors and children were outside, it was shot and killed by one of the officers. The other chimpanzee was continuing on Rowland Avenue, where it was tranquilized shortly before 11:45 a.m. &ldquo;When you see the size of these animals, we think reasonable people would understand (to stay away),&rdquo; said Martin. The owners of the chimpanzees, David and Sheri Potochan, had been approved by the county for keeping exotic animals, Clark County spokesman Dan Kulin said. Martin said the female chimp had been returned to its owners. Metro Police public information officer Bill Cassell said reinforcements were made to the chimp&rsquo;s holding area before its return. He could not specify whether those adjustments were mandatory or a personal decision by the owner.','http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2012/jul/12/chimps-escape/','CJ and Buddy','Unknown','1','0',1,0,0,2,2,'Uniform',3,3,0,0,0,0),(894,'2009-02-16','Connecticut','Stamford','Stamford Police Department and Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection',1,100,0,'Chimpanzee','A Connecticut woman pleaded for police to &quot;please hurry&quot; to save a friend from an attack by a pet chimpanzee, according to emotional 911 recordings released Tuesday by Stamford police. &quot;He&#039;s ripping her apart,&quot; Sandra Herold, 70, tells dispatchers about her pet, Travis. With the chimp squealing in the background, Herold cries out, &quot;He&#039;s killed my friend!&quot; The victim, Charla Nash, 55, remains hospitalized with life-threatening injuries after the chimp, once featured in television commercials for Coca-Cola and Old Navy, attacked her Monday afternoon, police said. Nash had just arrived at Herold&#039;s house when Travis jumped on her and began biting and mauling her, causing serious injuries to her face, neck and hands, according to Stamford Police Capt. Rich Conklin. Conklin said the attack was unprovoked, but he described it as &quot;brutal and lengthy.&quot; Herold had called Nash to her house to help get 14-year-old Travis back inside after he used a key to escape. While her friend was being attacked, Herold was unable to pull the primate off. She then called 911 before stabbing the chimp with a butcher knife and hitting him with a shovel. Neither fazed Travis, who police said had been like a child to Herold. A Stamford police officer later shot the chimp multiple times after the primate went after him inside a police cruiser, Conklin said. Travis returned to the house, where police found him dead. Conklin estimated that Travis weighed close to 200 pounds. Conklin couldn&#039;t confirm media reports that the chimp had Lyme disease, though he did say investigators were taking their time with the case to determine what may have provoked Travis to attack Nash. Animals often do not exhibit symptoms of Lyme disease, caused by the bite of certain types of ticks, although aggression is a possible symptom, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Conklin said Nash had recently gotten a haircut that changed her appearance significantly. Conklin said the chimp had been acting &quot;rambunctious&quot; earlier, prompting Herold to put Xanax in a cup of tea for him to drink. He did not know if the animal had been prescribed the medicine or if Herold had ever given her pet such a mixture before. Conklin added that his department is not used to dealing with cases such as this, and they were trying to familiarize themselves with laws and regulations before deciding if charges will be filed. Conklin said this isn&#039;t the first interaction his officers have had with Travis. The chimp, who was well known and liked in the community, escaped in 2003 and &quot;wreaked havoc&quot; on the streets of Stamford for a couple of hours, Conklin said. Travis&#039; body was removed from the home and taken to two locations: His head was taken to the state lab for a rabies test and the body was taken to the University of Connecticut for an animal autopsy. Conklin said this is standard procedure. The chimp, who was known to walk around town, sometimes without a leash, also liked to surf on the Internet and was able to change the TV channel with a remote, according to a Stamford Advocate article. The paper also reported that Travis watered plants, was able to feed hay to his owner&#039;s horses, ate at a table with the rest of the family and sometimes drank wine from a stemmed glass. Charla Nash has since sued twice - the first lawsuit against the estate of Sandra Herold, the now-deceased former owner of Travis the chimp. Nash&#039;s second lawsuit was against the city of Stamford Connecticut, and alleged that the Department of Environmental protection neglected its duties by granting Herold an exotic animal license for Travis, allowing him to be kept in the home. This latter suit sought $150 million dollars in damages. In 2013, the courts dismissed Nash&#039;s suit against the city. Her legal team pressed on, seeking help from the state Judiciary Committee. May of 2014 the Committee voted against granting Nash relief, preventing her from moving forward with her latter lawsuit. Connecticut grants itself sovereign immunity in almost all torts, forcing those who wish to sue the state to request permission from the state to do so, in the form of the state claims commissioner. As one might expect, claims against the state are few and far between as a result.','http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1880229,00.html','Travis','Frank Chiafari','1','0',0,1,0,0,2,'Uniform',1,1,0,0,1,0),(895,'2014-05-02','Montana','Chillicothe','Chillicothe Police Department',1,1,0,'capuchin monkey','Friday night there was peace and calm in Chillicothe after an escaped monkey eluded police for hours and had neighbors scrambling for cover. The monkey was shot and killed by authorities in the city located in Livingston County, about 97 miles northeast of Kansas City. Police said they ran out of tranquilizer darts and had no choice but to use deadly force because they believed it would have been a threat to others. Chopper 5 was rolling when the creature was spotted running on the property of M&amp;L Trucking and Repair about 4 p.m. The monkey was running full speed and then stopped and collapsed. Later someone placed a blanket over it. The white-headed capuchin monkey escaped from Johnston Rental Center about 8:30 a.m. The creature got out of its cage and escaped through a vent. Police say the owner, Bill Johnston, is a licensed breeder by the United States Department of Agriculture and has about 30 of them, but the one that escaped Friday couldn&#039;t be contained. It had been sighted all around the city of 10,000 people, but mostly in the southern or southeast part of the city. &quot;We seen a bunch of cops, happened to look over and seen this monkey running through the yard and it took off running and the cops took off after it,&quot; William Johnson said. &quot;I think it was more scared than anything with everybody chasing it, but it was a fast little monkey,&quot; Nicole Irving said. Fast, free and elusive. These neighbors said the primate spent part of the day hiding in a garage on Herriford and Violet streets, directly across from the Garrison Elementary School which had to go on lockdown. &quot;We had preschoolers here at the building. We kept them safe. We did stay inside on this nice day, but everybody was kept safe,&quot; said teacher Kari Keller.\r\nJust before 4 p.m. there was another sighting at a metal shop, just a few blocks away, near International Road and McCormick Street. Attempts to sedate the money failed after the owner ran out of darts. That&#039;s when police said they were forced to shoot it. &quot;There was a fear that if we did not get the monkey caught, it could be a danger to someone,&quot; said Police Chief Richard Knouse. It was a fate neighbors were hoping would be avoided. &quot;It was kind of cute,&quot; Johnson said. Police say the owner of the monkey is Bill Johnston. Police say Johnston is not under arrest and they&#039;ll meet with the prosecutor before they decide to pursue any charges.','http://www.kltv.com/story/25415598/authorities-warn-of-missing-possibly-dangerous-monkey','Unknown','Unknown','1','0',1,0,0,0,2,'Uniform',3,3,0,0,0,0),(896,'2009-03-30','Missouri','Winston','Daviess County Sheriff&#039;s Office and Missouri Department of Agriculture',1,100,0,'Chimpanzee','A chimpanzee was shot and killed by a sheriff&#039;s deputy when the animal opened the door to the deputy&#039;s patrol car, grabbed his leg and tried to hit him, the Daviess County sheriff&#039;s office said Wednesday.

Police evacuated an estimated 300 people from the zoo compound Thursday and killed Jabari, a 13-year-old male western lowland gorilla, after he charged at officers. Zoo workers armed with tranquilizer guns had pursued the animal through the forested jungles of the Wilds of Africa exhibit for about 40 minutes, but could not gain a clear shot, officials said.\r\n&ldquo;It tried to charge two of our officers, so we had to shoot it,&rdquo; Deputy Police Chief Daniel Garcia said. &ldquo;You can imagine the pandemonium we had out here when he got loose. We felt terrible we had to put this animal down.&rdquo; The injured included a mother and her toddler son. Rivers Noah, 3, was in fair condition at Children&rsquo;s Medical Center with multiple bites to his head and chest. His mother, Keisha Heard, 26, who was bitten on the legs, and Cheryl Reichert, who suffered arm injuries, were treated at hospitals and released. &ldquo;I was like, &rsquo;This is not happening, this is so unreal,&rsquo; cause he just came out of nowhere,&rdquo; Heard said Friday on NBC&rsquo;s Today show. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m watching this gorilla. He has my son in his mouth, he&rsquo;s attacking him, and I tried to help him and there wasn&rsquo;t really anything that I could do. ... He slings me back across the concrete area where we are. So it was really scary.&rdquo; The fourth injured person, a child, was treated at the scene. Jabari was in the award-winning gorilla-conservation area, two acres surrounded by a 16-foot concave wall, before the attack around 5 p.m. Some youths had reportedly teased Jabari shortly before.\r\n&ldquo;He had to have scaled the wall,&rdquo; said zoo director Rich Buickerood. But &ldquo;this habitat is among the best in the country. This blows our minds.&rdquo; He said he did not know why zoo employees, who were armed with pepper spray, did not use it on the gorilla. Some zoo-goers hid inside a restaurant and the monorail surrounding the Wilds of Africa exhibit. The gorilla darted in and out of thick bamboo and trees before officers spotted him on a nature trail. He was holding a pair of white children&rsquo;s sandals when he came within 15 feet of two officers who shot him, police Lt. Anthony Williams said. The 114-year-old zoo has been in financial straits and the nonprofit Dallas Zoological Society recently proposed a county takeover. Buickerood said last month that the zoo staff had been cut and maintenance postponed because of the fund shortage.','http://www.nbcnews.com/id/4558461/ns/us_news/t/gorillas-escape-violent-rampage-stun-zoo-officials/#.VBsJtvldXGA','Jabari','Two Unknown Police','2','0',1,1,0,0,2,'Uniform',1,1,0,0,0,0),(898,'2008-03-12','Texas','Bastrop','University of Texas at Houston Police Department',1,100,0,'Chimpanzee','An 18-year-old research chimpanzee was shot and killed after he escaped from an enclosure at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center facility in Bastrop.

They used &quot;at least one tranquilizer dart&quot; before a 5-year-veteran of the police department fatally shot the animal, said assistant Police Chief Thomas Engells with the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.

Jake was returned safely to his enclosed area. The animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has filed a formal complaint with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, alleging failure to ensure structurally sound housing and qualified personnel to care for the animals. &quot;Chimpanzees are intelligent, sensitive, and resourceful -- they shouldn&#039;t be incarcerated in laboratories in the first place,&quot; said Debra Durham, a PETA primate specialist. &quot;Research on chimpanzees is banned in many countries.

Boise police say the 75-pound dog ran aggressively toward officers as they walked up to Lortz&rsquo;s trailer home on Patricia Lane. One officer fired five shots. Three bullets hit Lortz&rsquo;s Subaru, flattening both tires on the passenger side and hitting a door handle, he said. &ldquo;They shot my dog and killed my car,&rdquo; said Lortz, who described the dog as a 5-year-old Australian Bandog. The incident began about 10:15 a.m. Sunday when a neighbor called police, saying it sounded like a fight was going on and someone may be hurt. Lortz said his wife was having a panic attack related to her medication, had been crying out in the yard and then came back inside. Accounts from Lortz and the police differ, principally about whether the gate leading to Lortz&rsquo;s yard was open or shut when police arrived. Lortz said his wife had just been next to the gate and was sure it was closed. Officers reported it was open and the dog ran through it before they reached the gate. Lortz, who was inside the trailer, didn&rsquo;t see what happened but &ldquo;heard gunshots go off in my driveway and my dog screaming.&rdquo; From what police told him and evidence at the scene, he said he believes one officer opened the gate and startled Scrappy Doo, which in turn startled the officer, who ran toward the back of the Subaru. &ldquo;When he ran, the dog gave barking chase, his partner saw it and opened fire,&rdquo; Lortz said. Here&rsquo;s what Boise police say: Officers arrived, parked nearby and heard yelling inside the trailer as they walked toward it, police spokeswoman Lynn Hightower said. The Subaru was parked close to the gate, and as officers walked along the Subaru&rsquo;s passenger side, a large dog ran out of the yard. &ldquo;The officers described the dog as growling and baring its teeth ... charging toward them and within just a couple feet of them both,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Both officers felt the dog was attacking them and about to bite them. Both pulled their firearms to defend themselves. &ldquo;One officer began to run and turned away,&rdquo; she said, adding that the officer has trained with the BPD&rsquo;s canine unit, including wearing a &ldquo;bite suit&rdquo; for training, and &ldquo;knows when a dog is about to bite.&rdquo; &ldquo;The second officer, also just feet away and seeing the threat to both himself and the other officer, immediately fired at the dog.&rdquo; Police reported that the dog was shot twice, and Lortz said that&rsquo;s what he initially thought. But, he said, it now appears one bullet struck a bell on the gate, knocking it into the dog&rsquo;s neck and causing a 2-inch cut. &ldquo;He was saved by the bell,&rdquo; Lortz said. &ldquo;There was blood on the bell.&rdquo; Police gave Lortz a restitution form to fill out, and Lortz said his initial impression is that he will likely be reimbursed for damage to the car but not for the veterinarian bills, which run about $400 so far. Hightower said no such determination has been made, and the city&rsquo;s insurer will decide which damages will be covered. Lortz said Scrappy Doo still has a bullet near his ribcage but is recovering well and in good spirits, something he called &ldquo;miraculous.&rdquo; He said he doesn&rsquo;t blame the officers. &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t come here to kill my dog.

Owner Gabrielle Stropkai said she had let the dog out to use the bathroom as she sat outside her apartment with neighbors. Stropkai said the dog had become more wary of strangers since giving birth two weeks ago. &ldquo;She barks at people she really doesn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Stropkai said. Police claim that Kita charged toward the officers, snarling and acting aggressively. One officer shot the animal in the back of the head when she was less than 3 feet away. Stropkai contested the police account. She said Kita was walking back toward the entrance of Stropkai&rsquo;s ground-level apartment when she began to bark at the officers, but did not charge or act aggressively toward them. The officer asked Stropkai and her friends to whom the dog belonged. Then, according to Stropkai, he immediately pulled his weapon and fired, killing the dog in front of her 2-year-old son. Stropkai and her neighbors tried to staunch the bleeding, but it was too late. Kita never made it to the vet. &ldquo;I ran towards her and grabbed her face, but you could already tell,&rdquo; Stropkai said. &ldquo;I felt her take her last breath, and she was dead.&rdquo; Police spokesman Charles McClure said the officer was within his rights to use lethal force to protect himself if he felt the dog was somehow a threat to him. &ldquo;As with every citizen, a person has a right to defend themselves,&rdquo; he said. The pet was running loose in front of the apartment, a violation of the city ordinance that requires dogs to be leashed, he said. Stropkai was not cited. McClure said there&rsquo;s no indication the shooting was inappropriate, and he noted that independent witnesses to the shooting said they saw the dog acting aggressively. Stropkai said Kita had never bit anyone and was not a threat to the officer. Stropkai said she had the dog since it was 5 weeks old, and Kita had always displayed an even temperament. Stropkai also said that if Kita had been charging, she would have been shot in the face or chest. Instead, the bullet entered the back of the dog&rsquo;s head and exited through her stomach. An investigation into the shooting is ongoing, McClure said. Officials plan to conduct a review of the use of force policy, as is typical in this type of incident, he said. McClure said there&rsquo;s no estimated date for the investigation to be completed. Neighbor Kenny Taylor was outside with Stropkai when the shooting occurred. He said Kita began to bark after the officer asked about the dog&rsquo;s owner. &ldquo;I was already headed down the sidewalk, and boom,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There was no time to get the dog, nothing.&rdquo; On Monday morning, Stropkai&rsquo;s 2-year-old son rode his bicycle around the small parking lot in front of the apartments, circling past the spot where Kita&rsquo;s bloodstains were still visible on the pavement. Inside, six puppies slept together in a crate. Stropkai said she has to bottle-feed them every few hours. All of the puppies have been claimed, she said, but they are too young to go to their new homes. For now, Stropkai and her friends are just trying to keep the 2-week-old dogs alive and healthy. Pete Ritter, Boise&#039;s deputy police chief, called Kita&rsquo;s death &ldquo;unfortunate.&rdquo; &ldquo;Officers never want to harm an animal,&rdquo; he said in a statement. &ldquo;The dog came upon the officers quickly and they felt it was about to bite them. This is a very dog-friendly community. Many officers have dogs. We work with dogs. Dogs running loose are a safety risk, for people and for the dogs. This was a very unfortunate situation for everyone involved.&rdquo; Stropkai asked why the officer, if he truly felt threatened, didn&rsquo;t deploy a Taser or pepper spray rather than lethal force. &ldquo;You could have kicked my dog away from you and she would still be here,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;She could have a broken rib or something, and I would take care of her, but she would still be here.

A lot of us are dog lovers.&rdquo; The second dog fled when the shots were fired, Sgt. Tim Randall said. Officers don&rsquo;t know if it has since returned to the home. A dog was barking inside the residence Wednesday evening when the Press-Tribune spoke with Carver. The welfare check was otherwise routine, Kingsbury said, and the caller&rsquo;s concerns, when investigated, were unfounded. Carver, who ran outside just after shots were fired, believes the situation could have been handled differently. He questioned why the police didn&rsquo;t use the &ldquo;mace&rdquo; they had on them on the dog instead. &ldquo;I just didn&rsquo;t understand that and they were here to do a welfare check, and they&rsquo;re firing guns,&rdquo; Carver said. Pepper spray from the belt of the officer who shot the dog was punctured by apparent bite marks. Randall said that while it&rsquo;s acceptable to have dogs for protection, it&rsquo;s important to understand the liability that goes along with it. &ldquo;They need to be careful to make sure that the dog doesn&rsquo;t come into contact with the wrong person,&rdquo; Randall said. &ldquo;Whether that&rsquo;s keeping the door locked, or a good fenced yard, a secure yard that&rsquo;s well-signed.&rdquo; The two videos were taken by the officers&rsquo; CopVu cameras, small devices that clip to their uniforms shirts and are activated with a simple slide motion.

Geary says Brangers shot and killed those five dogs. Geary reported his incident to authorities. As far as the Scott County Sheriff&#039;s Office is concerned, the case is closed.

It is not the place of this website to do so. What is of interest is the killing of the Weaver family dog, Striker. Below we will outline just the events that lead to Striker&#039;s killing. Its of interest that Striker was the first casualty of Ruby Ridge. The following excerpt is from Wikipedia, reproduced 9-18-2014 at 2:19 PM EST: Operation &quot;Northern Exposure&quot; was suspended for three months due to the confirmation hearings for USMS Director Henry E. Hudson.The Weavers noticed the lack of USMS activity and began to believe the USMS had dropped the case. On August 21, 1992, six marshals were sent to scout the area to determine suitable places away from the cabin to ambush and arrest Weaver. The marshals, dressed in camouflage, were equipped with night-vision goggles and M16 rifles. DUSMs Art Roderick, Larry Cooper and Bill Degan formed the reconnaissance (Recon) team, while DUSMs David Hunt, Joseph Thomas and Frank Norris formed an observation post (OP) team on the ridge north of the cabin. At one point, Roderick threw two rocks at the Weaver cabin to test the reaction of the dogs. The dogs became alerted, and Weaver&#039;s friend Kevin Harris, and Weaver&#039;s 14 year old son, Samuel, emerged and followed the dog Striker to investigate. Harris and the younger Weaver were hoping that the dog had noticed a game animal since the cabin was out of meat. Sammy Weaver told his father he believed the dogs had sensed either a large animal or a man in the woods. The Recon team marshals (Roderick, Cooper and Degan) initially retreated through the woods in radio contact with the OP team, but later took up hidden defensive positions. Later the OP team marshals and the Weavers both claimed the Weaver dogs were alerted to the Recon team marshals in the woods after neighbors at the foot of the mountain started their pickup truck. The Recon team marshals retreated through the woods to the &quot;Y&quot; juncture in the trails 500 yards west of the cabin, out of sight of the cabin. Sammy and Harris followed the dog Striker on foot through the woods while Randy also on foot took a separate logging trail. Vicki, Sara, Rachel, and baby Elisheba remained at the cabin, at first appearing anxious to the OP team, but later appearing relaxed. Randy encountered the marshals at the &quot;Y&quot;; Roderick claimed to have yelled, &quot;Back off! U.S. Marshal!&quot; upon sighting Weaver, and Cooper said he had shouted, &quot;Stop! U.S. Marshal!&quot; Later statements by Roderick, Cooper and Randy agreed that Randy responded by cursing and retreating from the marshals. About a minute later the dog and the boys came out of the woods and a firefight erupted between the marshals and Sammy and Harris.\r\nAccounts differ at this point as to who first opened fire but agree that DUSM Roderick shot and killed Weaver&#039;s dog and that Samuel Weaver returned fire at Roderick. After the Federal agents began firing, 14 year old Samuel Weaver was shot in the back while retreating, and DUSM Degan was shot and killed by Harris.\r\nThe version of the firefight told by DUSMs Roderick and Cooper was that the dog, followed by Harris then Sammy, came out of the woods. DUSM Degan challenged Harris, who turned and shot Degan dead without Degan firing a single shot. Roderick then shot the dog once, Sammy fired at Roderick twice, and Roderick fired once again. Roderick and Cooper heard multiple gunshots from the Weaver party. Cooper fired two three-shot bursts at Harris and Cooper saw Harris fall &quot;like a sack of potatoes&quot;. An impact caused leaves to fly up in front of Cooper who then sought cover. Cooper saw Sammy run away. Cooper radioed to OP team Dave Hunt that he had wounded or killed Harris.\r\nHarris&#039; version was that, when the dog followed by Sammy then Harris came out of the woods, the dog ran up to Cooper and danced about as he did in playing with the children. The dog then ran to Roderick, who shot the dog in front of Sammy, who cursed Roderick and shot at him. Degan came out of the woods firing his M16 and hit Sammy in the arm. Harris then fired and hit Degan in the chest knocking him down. Cooper fired at Harris who ducked for cover. Cooper fired again and Sammy was hit in the back and fell. Harris fired about 6 feet in front of Cooper and forced him to take cover. Cooper announced that he was a US Marshal. Harris checked Sammy&#039;s body, found him dead, and ran to the cabin.','http://mag.newsweek.com/1995/08/27/the-echoes-of-ruby-ridge.html','Striker','US Marshalls Art Roderick, Larry Cooper, Bill Degan, Lon Horiuchi, David Hunt, Joseph Thomas, Frank Norris et al','1','0',1,0,1,1,1,'Uniform',1,2,1,0,1,1),(905,'2013-05-27','Idaho','Idaho Falls','Idaho Falls Police Department',1,50,0,'American Bulldog mix','Idaho Falls police shot and killed a dog Monday night while they were serving a warrant. Officers said an American Bulldog mix ran aggressively toward them as they were approaching a home on the 1100 block of Irving Street. Police reports show this is only the third time in the last few years where officers had to shoot a dog to protect themselves; but they said using deadly force is always a last resort. Idaho Falls Police say they deal with dogs on a regular basis and every so often, they&#039;ll come across what appears to be an aggressive dog. &quot;Usually we&#039;ll meet them at the door and we&#039;ll tell them they have to put their dog away,&quot; said Capt. Royce Clements with IFPD. &quot;...but those are situations where we have time to deal with it.&quot; Capt. Clements said the officer who shot the dog Monday night had no other option, but neighbor Wade Mitchell says he didn&#039;t think the dog was an aggressive dog. &quot;I&#039;ve seen the dog and the dog has always seemed fine to me,&quot; said Mitchell. &quot;There&#039;s kids always out playing and the dog hasn&#039;t seemed to be aggressive to anybody before.&quot; Police said in a situation where an officer is being attacked, there&#039;s limited time to react and they&#039;re trained to use the most effective option they have. &quot;You don&#039;t have the option of trying pepper spray and if the wind catches it and blows it away then I&#039;ll go to my taser but if I miss then I&#039;ll try something else,&quot; said Clements.\r\nUltimately though, the responsibility lies with the dog owners. &quot;We encourage people to definitely take proper care and precautions, know their animals and be responsible pet owners,&quot; Clements. Anytime deadly force is used to put down an animal, officers said a thorough investigation takes place to see if protocol was followed and if the officer&#039;s actions are justified. Sometimes forensic investigators will even re-construct the crime scene to help determine that.

Jeff Blitz, who let his dog Ace out early Thursday morning, detailed the moment he heard gun shots while sitting inside his garage. &ldquo;They shot the dog and then came to the garage. The dog came around to me and he (the trooper) said &lsquo;you better calm down,&rsquo;&rdquo; Blitz told ABC 27. &ldquo;I said, &lsquo;calm down? You just killed my dog.&rsquo;&rdquo; Blitz&rsquo;s neighbor, William Maynes, who heard the entire altercation from his home across the street, gave even greater insight into the trooper&rsquo;s actions. &ldquo;There was a lady running down the road saying &lsquo;don&rsquo;t shoot the dog, don&rsquo;t shoot the dog,&rsquo;&rdquo; Maynes recalled. &ldquo;&hellip; So I got up, looked out the window and all the sudden I heard bang, bang, bang&hellip;&rdquo; According to police, several local and federal law enforcement agencies were attempting to issue an arrest warrant for Blitz&rsquo;s daughter when the dog was shot. When researching for the arrest, the agencies failed to discover that Blitz&rsquo;s daughter had long since moved from the residence. Even worse, Blitz&rsquo;s 5-year-old grandson Dane was only feet away inside his room as the trooper wildly shot twice into the lawn before hitting the dog. &ldquo;They walked away when I pointed it out, I said &lsquo;you already took one part of my family and there&rsquo;s a second one in there watching TV,&rsquo;&rdquo; Blitz said. &ldquo;He could of got it too.&rdquo; Despite Ace being shot in the side, which leads Blitz to believe his dog was not being a threat to officers, Pennsylvania State Police spokesperson Rob Hicks defended the shooting, arguing that the offending trooper was likely keeping people safe. &ldquo;Every once in a while we get thrown into a situation where we have to protect either ourselves or somebody else and this is one of those situations,&rdquo; Hicks said. Blitz says the hardest part has been explaining the situation to his grandson, who watched Ace get buried in the backyard as police stood around in the front. &ldquo;He was just out there sitting talking to him a while ago,&rdquo; Blitz explained. &ldquo;He asked me, &lsquo;Pappy, can I go talk to Ace?.&rsquo;&rdquo; Although an investigation has been opened into the matter, few expect the trooper to be held accountable for shooting a dog outside the wrong home. &ldquo;The investigation is going to look at the whole picture, but the biggest point of the investigation is to be looking at whether the use of force was warranted in this situation,&rdquo; Hicks added.','http://www.abc27.com/story/25416604/trooper-shoots-kills-york-county-mans-dog','Ace','Unknown','2','0',1,0,0,0,2,'Uniform',0,2,0,0,2,0),(909,'2013-09-01','Utah','Saint George','Saint George Police Department and Washington County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office',1,2,1,'Unconfirmed','A police shooting of a dog named Loki last Sunday remains under investigation by both the St. George Police Department and the Washington County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office. The St. George Animal Shelter and family have addressed placement of excess dogs that had been kept in addition to Loki at the owners&rsquo; home. In addition, Best Friends Animal Society has stepped in to accept Loki and tend to his medical needs and care. The history of the family involved, their dogs and neighbors reveals a pattern of similar incidents, including dogs biting people, dogs allowed to roam free of constraint and an excessive number of dogs maintained at their residences. While not all neighbors agree, neighbor concerns and complaints over the family&rsquo;s dogs, both at this residence and previous ones is not new. A St. George Police officer responded to the neighborhood of 1500 West and 1400 North last Sunday, when dogs were reported running loose and causing concern to neighbors. The officer observed four dogs and shot at one of them three times when the dog aggressively charged him, according to police statements. Resident Sherrill Brinkerhoff, who said she owns Loki, has lived at 1563 West 1400 North in the neighborhood for 13 years.  It is a a quaint, but by no means quiet neighborhood, in St. George. She is not the only dog owner there. Three &ldquo;Beware of Dog&rdquo; signs can be seen hanging on fences around yards throughout the neighborhood and dogs can be heard barking from inside neighboring homes and backyards. Brinkerhoff&rsquo;s residence is home to extended family from time to time as well as many dogs. A U-haul trailer was still attached to a truck parked in front of Brinkerhoff&rsquo;s house, Wednesday, evidencing the move her son Kolten Winder had just made to come live with her. Winder had arrived the  day before with his fianc&eacute; Chelsea Chiacchiera, two children and a dog, Dexter. The City of St. George has a two-dog limit on residences and includes provision for dog owners to apply for a kennel license if they wish to maintain more than two dogs at a given residence. This family of dog owners tends to watch each other&rsquo;s dogs and considers them all one in the family, Chiacchiera said, accounting for some confusion in who owns what dog. As of Sunday, there were eight dogs at the house. None of the dogs are licensed with the City of St. George. This is not a new or isolated incident with this family. City Attorney Shawn Guzman said that citations have previously been issued for too many dogs in that home. According to a statement issued earlier this week, neighbors told police that the dogs have acted aggressively towards them in the past. Records kept by the City of St. George include multiple criminal citations against members of this family. Between 1999 and 2006, Brinkerhoff, then named Winder, was cited five times for animal-at-large / attack / cruelty, and four times for two license violations each, at various other addresses. In 2007, Chiacchiera was cited at a different address when Angela Billmire was bitten by Chiacchier&rsquo;s pit bull on the upper left leg, on the back side by her butt. According to the incident report, &ldquo;The owner of the dog Chelsea stated the dog was getting aggressive and had bitten two other people the previous week. She turned the dog over to animal control.&rdquo; In June 2012, Brinkerhoff&rsquo;s dog, Sebastian (identified as Sabastain in the police report), bit neighbor Jim Brey on the back of his calf one night while Brey was on the sidewalk in front of her home. The dog was quarantined because animal control found Brinkerhoff&rsquo;s yard not secure enough to ensure home quarantine. Winder and  his family told St. George News about Sebastian. They said he was vicious and they had to put him down.\r\nIn October 2012, neighbors Shanna and Kyle Crosby complained about the dogs at the current Brinkerhoff home. According to the incident report, the Crosbys said: &ldquo;As people started walking close to the residence the dogs would start barking and run out into the street after the people.&rdquo; On investigation, officers identified one each of the following breeds at the home: sheltie, hound mix, black lab, German short hair mix, little mix-breed, and an extremely large pit bull / mastiff mix. There were also two puppies in the residence. A door was accidentally left open due to the move, Chiacchiera said. She said she had been sleeping and Loki and Dexter let themselves out and began wandering the yard and the street area in front of the home. St. George Police said there were four dogs loose when they arrived. &ldquo;I woke up to three gun shots,&rdquo; Chiacchiera said, consistent with the police statement that three shots were fired when the dog charged the officer. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think the cop should have shot the dog,&rdquo; neighbor Irma Gonzalez said. &ldquo;What I saw was the cop near the truck and the dog was far away. Three shots is excessive.&rdquo; &ldquo;I went into our kitchen, and there was blood everywhere,&rdquo; Chiacchiera said. She walked into Brinkerhoff&rsquo;s bedroom and found Loki bleeding and immediately rushed him to a veterinary clinic; the City of St. George paid the bill, she said. Neighbor Irma Gonzalez said the dogs have never been aggressive with her or her own dogs. She said she questions why police responded to an animal control issue and fears how this was handled and is keeping a watchful eye on her own pets. The officer used a hand gun in self defense, St. George Police Sgt. Sam Despain said; &ldquo;the officer was protecting himself at that point, the outcome was what it was, he really was just protecting himself.&rdquo; Chiacchiera did not witness the shooting and has only heard secondhand stories from neighbors. But she said one story she was told was that an elderly couple was taking a walk Sunday morning, when they saw her dogs they crossed the street as a precaution and called the police because the dogs seemed unattended and are widely known as an aggressive breed. Loki, the dog involved in the current shooting incident, is a 15-pound, medium-size blue heeler/pit bull mix, a &ldquo;friendly and curious dog,&rdquo; Chiacchiera said, as the family gathered around three of their other dogs Wednesday.NOTE: The weight claimed here along with the combination of breed claimed makes no sense, particularly when considered along with pictures of Loki. The breed and weight remain unconfirmed until issued by Best Friends Animal Society. While his daughter, Jasmine, kissed their pit bull Dexter, egging him on for a friendly wrestling match in the front yard on Wednesday, Winder watched. He wouldn&rsquo;t have vicious animals around his 9-month-old baby and his 5-year-old daughter, he said, and related the story of Sebastian who the family previously owned and had to put down because he was vicious. On Wednesday, Chiacchiera said that Loki was in critical condition and still needed surgery for a wounded front right paw and rear left paw. He was hit by three bullets, one of which grazed his lip after going through his nose, she said. The family needed to come up with $2,000 for the dog or decide to have him euthanized (no requirement to euthanize the dog has been imposed by authorities) and the family was seeking donations to cover the surgery. St. George Animal Shelter&rsquo;s manager, St. George Police Sgt. Ivor Fuller, said Loki was not in critical condition and had not been sedated. He had been given pain pills to keep him comfortable. &ldquo;The injuries were to his legs,&rdquo; Fuller said, &ldquo;he had casts on and was able to move around and did not act like he was in any pain at all.&rdquo; (NOTE-Since Fuller is a police officer, he has every reason to downplay the extent of Loki&#039;s injuries. Fullers credibility is additionally compromised when we consider that as soon as St George handed custody of the dog to Best Friends Animal Society, they rushed him into surgery.) Loki has since been taken into the care of Best Friends Animal Society.&ldquo;The owners released the animal to us, and we released the animal to Best Friends, who now has custody of Loki and is taking care of all his medical needs and they will place him in their facility,&rdquo; Fuller said. Today, Loki is in Las Vegas in surgery, Best Friends Media Representative Barbara Williamson said. &ldquo;We did accept the dog,&rdquo; Williamson said, &ldquo;and as part of the dog being accepted to Best Friends we agreed that he will not be adopted into St George or Washington County.&rdquo; She said such stipulations are not unusual. Brinkerhoff has yet to be charged with anything. Chiaccheria has been charged with failure to control a vicious animal, dog at large and failure to license.','http://www.stgeorgeutah.com/news/archive/2013/09/06/sai-officer-involved-dog-shooting-family-patterns-best-friends-steps-in-for-loki/#.VBs7rPldXGA','Loki','Unknown','0','1',1,0,0,1,1,'Uniform',0,1,2,0,2,0),(910,'2011-03-21','Utah','Santaquin','Utah County Sheriff&#039;s Office and Orem Police Department',1,2,0,'Unconfirmed','Josh Boren, the police officer who shot and killed his wife, two young children and mother-in-law before taking his own life, was once disciplined for shooting at a stray dog while he was on duty rather than taking it to the shelter. According to a report obtained by the Deseret News through a public records request, Boren was suspended without pay for 36 hours in 2011 while he was working for the Utah County Sheriff&#039;s Office. On March 21, 2011, Boren called his supervisor to report that he was &quot;in trouble.&quot; He had picked up stray dog that appeared to be abandoned, took it to a remote area of Keigly Quarry near Santaquin, and fired at least three rounds at the dog with a .22 rifle in an attempt to kill the animal, the report states. It was unknown if any of the rounds actually hit the dog. However, one of the rounds did strike the passenger door of his patrol car, according to the report. Boren &mdash; who once worked as an animal control officer &mdash; later admitted he did not follow the department&#039;s protocols. &quot;Instead of booking the dog into the South County Animal Shelter in accordance with policy, you attempted to destroy the animal on your own,&quot; the report states. &quot;Although Orem Police Department did not find enough evidence to support criminal charges, your misconduct rises to the level of a serious behavior problem as defined (by the department&#039;s code book),&quot; the report states. &quot;Your misconduct has caused serious discredit to your credibility as a peace officer and to the Utah County Sheriff&#039;s Office.&quot; Boren, 34, graduated from Peace Officer Standards and Training in 2006. He worked at the Utah County Jail and as an animal control officer during his time with the sheriff&#039;s office. Boren had taken a job last fall as an officer with the Lindon Police Department. He was selected from a field of 70 candidates. His 2011 suspension was the only disciplinary action taken against him from either department. After Boren failed to report to work on Jan. 16, he and his family &mdash; wife Kelly Boren, 32; children Joshua &ldquo;Jaden&rdquo; Boren, 7, and Haley Boren, 5; and mother-in-law Marie King, 55 &mdash; were found dead inside their home at 37 N. 630 West in Spanish Fork.

A single funeral service was held Wednesday in Layton for Kelly, Jaden and Haley Boren and Marie King. A funeral service for Josh Boren was held in Spanish Fork on Thursday. Many of Josh Boren&#039;s friends and co-workers described him as a big teddy bear whom they wouldn&#039;t expect to lash out with such violence. But RiRi Whiting, one of Kelly Boren&#039;s best friends, believes there was more happening with her friend&#039;s marriage than what appeared on the surface. Just hours before her body was found, Whiting said she texted Kelly Boren who was headed home after work.

Police say the dog was ordered to attack them and was shot in self-defense. However, the dog&rsquo;s owners dispute police&rsquo;s claims that the dog was aggressive and that there was no reason to put it down. A woman called police earlier to conduct a welfare check on her brother whom she hadn&#039;t heard from in three days, Lt. Tim Scott said. She was worried that he may be in danger of gang violence. At about 1 a.m. Wednesday two officers responded to the address on the 2900 block of Monroe Boulevard, Scott said. The officers rattled a chain-link fence around the home to check for a dog, but got no response, he said. The fence has a No Trespassing sign and Beware of Dog sign attached to it. They knocked on the door several times to make contact with the subject of the welfare check before they saw the man come from the back of the home with a baseball bat. Officers attempted to explain the situation to the man, who refused to cooperate and shouted expletives at them, Scott said. The man told officers that he would sic his dog on them, at which point he brought out a pit bull from behind the home. Officers say the man commanded the dog to &ldquo;get him,&rdquo; prompting the dog to move toward police in an aggressive manner. The officer closest to the pit bull drew his gun and fired at the dog, killing it in self-defense, Scott said. Mia Mendiola said the house that police responded to is her parents&rsquo; home. The parents are the dog&rsquo;s owners. &quot;Chuva wasn&rsquo;t just our dog, she was family,&ldquo; Mendiola said. The 11-year-old pit bull was given to her mother as a Mother&rsquo;s Day gift, and has since been a very gentle dog, Mendiola said. Mendiola, who lives next door to her parents, said she was awakened by multiple gunshots outside. She went outside and saw her mother, 58-year-old Barbara Sustaipa, in a panic after seeing her dog dead. \r\nSustaipa had to be taken to the hospital and was found to have suffered a heart attack, Mendiola said. The man police were there to see was Mendiola&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s boyfriend, Victor Rosa, she said. She said she doubts police officers&rsquo; account that he was threatening them with a baseball bat and the dog. No arrests were made at the scene. However, the Weber County Attorney&rsquo;s Office is screening charges against the man for assault on police, Scott said. With family members outside and upset, the officers opted not to make an arrest and left the scene to deescalate the situation, although the officers had enough probable cause to arrest Rosa, Scott said. Police said the man has a prior criminal history including simple assault, assault against a police officer and protective order violations. Scott said an internal investigation into the officers&rsquo; actions is being conducted alongside the criminal investigation into Rosa. Ogden Animal Services said they have had multiple calls of animal abuse at that home, but have never been able to make contact with the owners or the dog. Mendiola said Chuva was very loved among the family and that she has never been vicious. &quot;They could have done a lot of things differently,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There was absolutely no reason for her to die.&rdquo; Scott said the officers did not want to shoot the animal, but when faced with an attacking dog, police protocol calls for them to put the dog down quickly. The dog&rsquo;s remains are with Animal Services and will likely be returned to the owners.','http://www.standard.net/Police/2014/07/23/Utah-family-outraged-by-police-shooting-pit-bull.html','Chula','Two Unknown Police','1','0',0,0,1,0,0,'Uniform',0,1,0,0,2,0),(912,'2010-07-01','Florida','Orlando','Orange County Sheriff&#039;s Office SWAT',1,2,0,'Unconfirmed','Orange County, Fla. sheriff&#039;s officers forced their way in to a home, killed the pet dog as it hid in a closet and shot a teenage girl without justification, apparently while looking for someone else, the family claims in court.

The women say the raid was reckless and excessive, that at no time before the forced entry did the sheriff&#039;s office contact them to try to find out if Christopher Seda lived there, which he did not. They seeks damages for negligence, property damage, excessive force, battery, assault, false imprisonment and violation of Florida&#039;s Knock and Announce law. The Knock and Announce law requires law enforcement to knock and allow a reasonable opportunity to permit a peaceful entry. The women claim they have been embarrassed and emotionally distressed, and had no choice but to move after the incident that made their family a &quot;public scandal.&quot; They are represented by Darylaine Hernandez, of Orlando.   Hernandez did not respond to requests for comment by press time. The Orange County Sheriff&#039;s Office declined to comment.

She said the dog, named Rednose, was shot once in the shoulder and has required extensive surgery. Police in Cottonwood Heights, Utah, say a border collie was being walked by its owner on a sidewalk when the pit bull attacked it. An officer responding to the scene tried to break up the dogs by kicking the pit bull and using a Taser. The officer eventually shot the pit bull, which then let go of the collie. But Guymon says Rednose was minding her own business when an off-leash dog wandered into her territory. She said Rednose was defending her turf. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a little sweetie,&rdquo; Guymon said of the nearly 2-year-old dog. &ldquo;She loves people. But she just doesn&rsquo;t like other dogs, especially when they trespass on her property. She even kissed the vet when he treated her. The police were wrong for using their gun, and now they&rsquo;ve got to pay for it.&rdquo; Cottonwood Heights Police Sgt. Gary Young told The Times that Guymon has previously been cited for having a dog at large and for having a vicious animal. In this case, &ldquo;the officer couldn&rsquo;t get the pit bull off the other dog. It had a death grip. He used his Taser and finally shot the thing,&rdquo; Young said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not paying for anybody&rsquo;s vet bill,&rdquo; he said.','http://articles.latimes.com/2012/oct/16/nation/la-na-nn-utah-pitbull-shooting-20121016','Rednose','Unknown','0','1',2,0,0,0,2,'Uniform',0,2,0,0,2,0),(914,'2014-03-04','South Carolina','Rock Hill','York County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office',1,50,0,'Labrador 9yo','Cop Jonathan Reed shoots a leashed 9 year old labrador in the head while performing a &quot;welfare check&quot; on an elderly mother. Alice Renee McGlone says her cats Rhett Butler and Tara will have to go on without Scarlett &ndash;&ndash; her 9-year-old Labrador retriever &ndash;&ndash; after a York County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office deputy shot and killed the dog when, he says, it charged him aggressively on Tuesday. McGlone&rsquo;s friend Ron Montana buried Scarlett on Wednesday afternoon in her backyard, under a tree, on Clara Street in Rock Hill. Montana and McGlone say they&rsquo;re outraged that the deputy used lethal force. But, sheriff&rsquo;s officials say the deputy had no choice but to protect himself from the dog.\r\n&ldquo;He hated to have done what he did but we teach our officers that they need to protect themselves in all situations,&rdquo; said Capt. Allen Brandon. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s regrettable what happened.&rdquo; Scarlett was a friendly dog and warmed to strangers easily, McGlone said. After adopting the dog from a shelter at six weeks old, she and Scarlett were &ldquo;inseparable.&rdquo; On Wednesday, Scarlett&rsquo;s body was covered by a teal blanket in McGlone&rsquo;s yard. Before Montana buried the dog, McGlone knelt beside Scarlett and held her paw. Montana and McGlone say they don&rsquo;t understand how a deputy felt so threatened by Scarlett that he shot her. On Tuesday, two deputies went to McGlone&rsquo;s house just before 4 p.m. after McGlone&rsquo;s daughter called police to say she hadn&rsquo;t heard from her mother since Feb. 26. McGlone had been sick, she explained, and her phone was dead on Sunday night when her daughter in Virginia tried to call. When deputies arrived for a routine welfare check, no one was home. There were no cars in the driveway and deputies noticed a broken window screen, pulled away from a window on the side of McGlone&rsquo;s house. They tried knocking on McGlone&rsquo;s front door first but got no response, according to a sheriff&rsquo;s office report. As one deputy, Jonathan Reed, knocked on a window at the rear of McGlone&rsquo;s house, he saw her dog &ldquo;charging&rdquo; and &ldquo;snarling with bared teeth,&rdquo; with its head lowered, the report states. As Reed &ldquo;retreated,&rdquo; he saw that the dog was on a leash, he wrote in the report. &ldquo;However, I saw that the leash was long enough to allow the dog to reach me before I could get away.&rdquo; With no time to &ldquo;yell at the dog or use a less lethal deterrent,&rdquo; Reed wrote, &ldquo;I instinctively drew my handgun and fired once, striking the dog in the top of the head.&rdquo; The one shot killed Scarlett. Reed was not injured during the incident.\r\nThe sheriff&rsquo;s office has reviewed the audio from Reed&rsquo;s body microphone, which was worn while he was at McGlone&rsquo;s home. The time in which Reed had to retreat or avoid injury by the dog, Brandon said, was just seconds. When Reed turned the corner of the back of the house to knock on a window, there were no signs of a dog in the backyard, Brandon said. It&rsquo;s possible that Scarlett was in her doghouse on the other end of the yard when Reed turned the corner. Reed has been with the sheriff&rsquo;s office for at least five years, Brandon said. It&rsquo;s rare, he said, that any deputy would have to resort to killing an animal while on duty. But, in the course of nearly 70,000 calls for service a year, he said, law enforcement officials face a lot of unknowns when arriving on scene. During property or welfare checks like the one at McGlone&rsquo;s house, dispatcher workers and deputies often are not told by family members that a dog or other animal will be on scene. But, Brandon said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s good information to have.&rdquo;\r\nIt helps keep animals and officers safer, he said, when more information is given to dispatch and relayed to officers. Scarlett usually protected the house by barking when someone pulled in the driveway, McGlone said, but the dog had never shown signs of aggression. Typically, Scarlett stayed inside with McGlone. When deputies arrived on Tuesday, Scarlett was on a leash or a tie-out, attached to a run line strung between two poles in the backyard. Even if her dog was aggressive toward the deputy, McGlone said, she thinks the deputy would have had enough room and time to back away.\r\nAnd, Montana said, he thinks the deputy should have realized there was a dog in the backyard before proceeding to the back window. He pointed out that the leash was not fully extended and, based on where Scarlett was killed, it appeared the deputy had shot at &ldquo;point blank range.&rdquo; A sign that reads &ldquo;Bad Dog&rdquo; was attached to Scarlett&rsquo;s doghouse in the yard. Montana says the sign was put there as a joke by one of McGlone&rsquo;s relatives. After Tuesday&rsquo;s shooting, one neighbor told Reed on Tuesday that Scarlett had tried in the past to bite his niece, causing him to call Animal Control, the report states. The Herald could not reach that neighbor on Wednesday. York County Animal Control officials told The Herald that the department has no record of a call regarding an aggressive animal at McGlone&rsquo;s residence or the neighbor who talked with Reed. It&rsquo;s possible that the neighbor complained about the dog to another agency, thinking he was calling Animal Control, said Steve Suber, the agency&rsquo;s director. Police records show that a warning was issued in January at the home for a leash law violation for the dog running loose, Brandon said. McGlone said sometimes Scarlett would get off her leash but that another neighborhood dog often ran loose and some people would blame her dog for those problems. A neighbor across the street from McGlone&rsquo;s house said she was shocked at the news because she thought Scarlett &ldquo;was a sweetheart dog,&rdquo; said Shana Renzema. She didn&rsquo;t see or hear Tuesday&rsquo;s incident. She and her children sometimes had helped take care of McGlone&rsquo;s dog while she was away. She&rsquo;d never noticed aggression or behavior problems with Scarlett. After McGlone was notified on Tuesday that a deputy had killed her dog, a sheriff&rsquo;s office supervisor met with her at her home. The sergeant seemed &ldquo;compassionate&rdquo; about the loss of Scarlett, McGlone said. He offered to have Animal Control remove Scarlett from her yard. McGlone says she can&rsquo;t even think about replacing Scarlett. Her grandmother &ndash; who died in December &ndash; had helped pick Scarlett out from the shelter. She adopted Scarlett and her two cats Rhett Butler and Tara around the same time. &ldquo;She just attached herself to us. It was love ever since,&rdquo; McGlone said. As Montana dug a hole in the yard for Scarlett&rsquo;s burial, McGlone sat inside her home, looking at pictures of Scarlett, as her cats meandered around the yard and onto the porch. McGlone was still in disbelief, she said, and wished she&rsquo;d done things differently before leaving the house on Tuesday. &ldquo;Something told me to just bring Scarlett in and I didn&rsquo;t. And I beat myself up for that.&rdquo; ','http://www.heraldonline.com/2014/03/05/5742510_officer-shoots-kills-dog-in-york.html?rh=1','Scarlett','Jonathan Reed','0','0',2,0,0,0,2,'Uniform',0,1,0,0,2,0),(915,'2014-06-21','Alaska','Juneau','Juneau Police Department',1,100,0,'Black Bear','Alaska authorities say they have shot and killed a black bear that lumbered through the front door of a home in the state&rsquo;s capital while people were inside.

The Alaska Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said it would have tried to help find homes for the animals, but Houston animal control hadn&rsquo;t contacted the agency. &ldquo;There are more humane ways of killing animals than taking them out and shooting them,&rdquo; said Cindy Liggett, who operates Kitty and K-9 Connection animal rescue in Anchorage &ldquo;We are not a poor society. We are not a backwoods community.

Purcell denied issuing any such order. &ldquo;Animal control keeps them for three to five days and then they&rsquo;re disposed of in a legal way.

He said euthanizing by gun is common in rural areas around the state. Sally Clampitt, executive director of the Alaska SPCA, said lethal injections are for more humane than is terminating a dog&rsquo;s life by gunshot. &ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s really horrible, frankly,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Our position is that euthanasia done by a licensed veterinarian is the preferred and most humane way.&rdquo;','http://www.adn.com/article/20100202/killing-shelter-animals-raises-uproar','Unknown','Charlie Seidl, Charley McAnally, Mayor Roger Purcell','1','0',0,0,0,3,3,'Not Sure',3,3,0,0,0,0),(917,'2014-06-14','Ohio','Dayton','Dayton Police Department',1,2,1,'Pit Bull Puppy 4 months old','Saturday night, the 100 block of McReynolds Street became the scene of an active investigation after witnesses said an officer wrongly shot a puppy. Dayton police officers originally responded to the east side area to address three adult dogs, including a white pit bull, that witnesses said were on the loose after attacking another neighborhing pit bull. Jenah Pearson and her husband, Curtis Gifford told 2NEWS that while chasing a dog an officer opened fire on Tike, their 4-month-old pit bull puppy. The bullet hit the tri-colored pit bull in his left hind leg, sending him to the vet according to the owners. Saturday they said they want justice for their pit bull. However, police officials had a different story. Officials said Officer Jason Olson tried to secure one loose dog in the alley when the puppy charged towards him, causing him to open fire. But Pearson and Gifford deny that version. The two own a licensed kennel, Roscoe&rsquo;s House of Blues, and said their $5,000 show dog was trained to stay on their property; in fact, they allege Tike was inside their gate going to the bathroom when they said the officer attacked. &ldquo;I heard my neighbor screaming, &lsquo;They shot your dog, they shot your dog&rsquo; and then when I went out there I found my puppy laying in a pool of blood,&rdquo; said Gifford. Moments after the shooting, two of the three dogs were caught and taken away by Montgomery County Animal Resource Center. At least eight police cruisers responded to the scene, as growing crowd surrounded the neighborhood. One man, Gifford&rsquo;s brother, was later arrested after jaywalking and refusing to provide his identification. Following this incident and a family member&rsquo;s arrest, the owners said they want an apology and for Officer Olson to be held accountable. &ldquo;Right now, I feel the police department should be sued for my medical bills and for two they should be sued for the fact that my dog will never be able to placed in a show again,&rdquo; said the owner. Saturday&rsquo;s incident is not the first time Dayton police have shot a pit bull; however, Sergeant Steven Bauer believes the breed is not the problem. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s just a pit bull problem that we have. I think it&rsquo;s a problem where the dogs aren&rsquo;t socialized with other people and other animals from being kept outside on chains 24 hours a day 7 days a week,&rdquo; he said.

The dog, growling and barking, had earlier charged at a woman trying to get from her car to her home. While investigating that complaint, two troopers were shown the unfenced house where the dog belonged and discovered a sliding glass door open with damage around the wooden door frame. A television was audible from inside the home. Thinking a burglary might be underway, the troopers searched the house but found no one inside, police spokesman Greg Shipley said in a news release. The troopers, who were not identified, then spotted the large pit bull across the street.\r\n&ldquo;The dog took an aggressive stance and then ran directly toward both troopers. The dog stopped about five feet away and was growling and barking viciously. The dog then lunged toward one of the troopers.

Lying on a garage floor sprinkled with blood splatter, the empty bed reminds the Guzman family that Bella was shot and killed by a Victoria police officer on Monday night. &quot;My dog died doing what she was supposed to do, protecting me and my babies,&quot; Jacob Guzman, one of the dog&#039;s owners, said Tuesday. Two-year-old Bella was shot when a Victoria police officer entered the Guzmans&#039; garage at 1710 E. Rosebud Ave. while searching for a discarded gun. At 7:16 p.m., officers were dispatched to the Guzmans&#039; neighborhood to look for a man who was reportedly walking down the street with a gun in his right pocket, said Victoria Police Chief Bruce Ure. &quot;Police confirmed there had been several acts of criminal mischief in the area where a pistol shaped like a BB gun had been used,&quot; Ure said. &quot;If someone carries an object that is designed to look like a handgun, our officers will treat that as a real gun.&quot; Upon locating the suspect, the first officer on the scene witnessed the suspect take something out of his pocket and throw it toward a garage door that was partially open. After a second officer arrived, one officer detained the 18-year-old suspect while the other officer went to look for the possibly discarded gun. The officers&#039; names were not released. While searching for the gun, the officer peered underneath the partially open garage door and saw Jacob Guzman and the gun, which at first glance, appeared to be a Sig semi-automatic handgun, according to the officer&#039;s report. He also heard a dog barking loudly. The Guzman family described the gun owner as a family acquaintance, but said they did not know why he chose to throw the gun in their garage. After the garage door was lifted, the officer saw Bella attached to a dumbbell weight in the middle of the floor and visibly upset. He instructed Jacob Guzman to put the barking Bella inside the house.\r\nGuzman followed the officer&#039;s instructions, but soon after, a 7-year-old family member inadvertently opened the house door, enabling Bella to re-enter the garage, The officer&#039;s report indicated Guzman was unable to restrain Bella, who came charging toward the officer growling and snarling with her head twisted sideways in an attempt to bite. The officer shot Bella, who was within inches of biting him. Six children, ranging in ages from 1 to 8, witnessed the shooting from inside the Guzman house.\r\n&quot;They are traumatized, wanting to know why she was shot in the garage,&quot; said Maria Guzman, one of Bella&#039;s owners. &quot;We certainly wish that the Guzman&#039;s dog hadn&#039;t got shot. Unfortunately, our officer was left without any options,&quot; said Ure, adding that animals are occasionally harmed while officers investigate crimes. &quot;You have to remedy these situations quickly and safely.&quot; The family and neighbors said the officer shot Bella a total of three times. After being shot, Bella ran to her front porch and clawed to get inside, Jacob Guzman said. She died shortly afterward on the porch. Ure contends the officer followed correct procedure in handling the situation.\r\nThe Guzman family, who raised Bella since she was 2 days old, was upset over the officer&#039;s actions. &quot;She&#039;s aggressive, but she was on her own property,&quot; said Maria Guzman. &quot;He shot her for protecting her family.&quot; Maria said the problems could have been avoided by not going into the garage in the first place. &quot;There should have been a different type of procedure,&quot; said Maria Guzman, who cried as she held Bella&#039;s brown collar. &quot;If he heard her barking, why not just come to the front door?&quot; Her son expressed similar sentiments. By all accounts, the Guzmans described Bella as a loving, well-mannered dog that loved children and never attacked anyone. The Guzmans said they are not looking for compensation from the police department for their loss, but providing another dog would be a nice and welcomed gesture. The BB gun owner was not arrested and was released at the scene.

The daughter was the owner of a Pit Bull dog which she had put away prior to the victim entering the residence for the visit.

The dog owner was unable to subdue the animal as this was occurring. As responding Troopers arrived, the dog, which had not stopped its attack on the victim, became aggressive towards them, and had to be put down. Its body was turned over to the SPCA.

The suit is Jane Flint v. City of Milwaukee et al Case Number: 2:2014cv00333. Filed: March 25, 2014 in Wisconsin Eastern District Court.\r\nFlint claims Milwaukee police shot to death two of her four friendly dogs while searching her house for dangerous animals - and all they found were turtles. Flint says it happened like this: In May 2010 she was living in a home owned by her boss, nonparty Terry Cullen. According to the 19-page lawsuit, Cullen bred and rehabilitated reptiles, including crocodiles, snakes and alligators, for zoos and humane societies. On May 7, 2010, police Det. Phil Simmert and another officer took a complaint from an informant who claimed that while considering an internship with Cullen, &quot;he treated her in a sexually inappropriate manner, and that he was illegally handling and keeping various reptiles, including alligators, in various locations,&quot; Flint says in the lawsuit. The informant also claimed that Cullen took her to Flint&#039;s home, according to the complaint. &quot;The informant then informed Detective Simmert that when she and Mr. Cullen entered Ms. Flint&#039;s residence, she was introduced to four dogs which were claimed to be Tibetan wolves. The informant told Detective Simmert that the &#039;wolves&#039; were &#039;somehow tamed and trained.&#039; &quot;The potential presence of four wolves in a Milwaukee residence was of interest to law enforcement, but somehow between May 7 and May 10, 2010, it was established that the animals originally described as Tibetan wolves by the informant were, in fact, Tibetan mastiffs. After they were learned to be Tibetan mastiffs, they were no longer of investigatory concern,&quot; the lawsuit states. Flint claims that on May 10, 2010, Det. Simmert contacted her and she told him that she was responsible for the care of the Tibetan mastiffs only, and was not in charge of any animals while Cullen was away.\r\nSimmert applied for and received a search warrant for Flint&#039;s residence. The warrant stated that Simmert was investigating the possibility of a threatened or endangered species and that Flint&#039;s residence had four purported Tibetan wolves, according to the complaint. Flint claims Simmert contacted a conservation warden from the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources to assist him in the search, because he believed that there would be a Chinese alligator in Flint&#039;s residence. Two days later, on May 12, Flint says, one of Cullen&#039;s employees called and told her that Simmert was executing a search warrant for her property. &quot;Ms. Flint immediately called Detective Simmert and told him she would leave work, and get home as soon as she could,&quot; the complaint states. &quot;Ms. Flint asked Detective Simmert to please wait so that she could have the opportunity to either confine her dogs or have a friend come and pick the dogs up so that the dogs would not be present during the search.&quot;\r\nIgnoring Flint&#039;s plea, Simmert executed the search warrant before she could retrieve her dogs. &quot;Ms. Flint&#039;s dogs were barking, but they did not approach the officers, they did not growl or show teeth, and they were wagging their tails,&quot; Flint claims. The conservation warden, nonparty Blankenheim, entered the house after it was cleared by Milwaukee police and saw some turtles in a glass cage, and heard a police officer yelling at Flint&#039;s dogs to lie down. &quot;After several minutes in the house, Warden Blankenheim heard the MPD tactical officer yelling for the dogs to get back. Warden Blankenheim heard several shots from an assault rifle and heard MPD officers saying two dogs were down,&quot; the complaint states. Flint says that when her dogs were shot, they were in a retreating position. When Flint finally arrived, she was told that the defendants had already shot two of her dogs. She was arrested for an &quot;on-the-scene determination&quot; that she had violated two state animal laws. Flint claims she was held and shuffled around jail as the defendants tried to concoct trumped-up felony charges to keep her there. &quot;Milwaukee Police Department records indicate that Ms. Flint was arrested on-view on May 14, 2010, at 5:13 p.m. and booked at 5:25 p.m. for felony charges of Viol/Endang/Threat S 29.604 [629 9MU] and Intentionally Mistreat 951.02 [620 1MA] However, Ms. Flint had already been arrested and held for more than 48 hours at this point,&quot; the complaint states. Flint was released from jail on May 15, 2010. Charges against her were dismissed; she was allowed to retrieve her two remaining living dogs for a fee and was issued two citations for possessing two midland painting turtles and seven common snapping turtles without a license. She seeks punitive damages for constitutional violations. She is represented by Jeff Olson, of Madison. A Chinese businessman last week paid $1.9 million for a single Tibetan mastiff puppy. It&#039;s believed to be the highest price ever paid for a dog.

At 7:48 p.m. on Friday, officers responded to a report of a possible vicious dog in the 700 block of State. The dog was observed going through trash in the area and became aggressive toward the complainant, ultimately going after him, the release said. The complainant made it to his home before the dog could reach him. Upon arrival the officer observed the dog near a residence on State. The dog was positioned near the porch of the residence and the resident was feeding the animal breadsticks, the released stated. The officer noticed the dog had a collar and tags and decided to approach to try to read the tags in attempt to reunite it with its owner. During the attempt, the dog became aggressive and came at the officer biting at his legs, the release said. &quot;The officer drew his weapon but was able to fend off this first attack by kicking at the dog and moving backward; however, the dog charged the officer a second time and the officer used his firearm, shooting once, to stop the attack,&quot; the release said. &quot;The circumstances and the result of this incident are unfortunate,&quot; the release said. &quot;The owner of the dog, in some manner, lost control, such that it was able to roam the neighborhood and the Midland Police Department was called to respond. Ultimately, the officer had to take action to protect himself as well as the community.&quot; The officer did have contact with the owner after the incident and at the owner&#039;s request, Midland police transported the deceased dog to the Humane Society, according to police.

The Torres family said they are devastated that their two, eight-month-old dogs were shot and killed. &ldquo;We were looking in on the house that&#039;s in front of us and we heard six consecutive gun shots,&quot; said Alex Torres. Torres said his family let the dogs out for a couple of minutes. He said they then started to worry when they couldn&rsquo;t find them.

However, a Milwaukee Police Department spokeswoman says there is more to this situation than what the Schroeders allege. Sonja Schroeder told FOX6 News her husband had just arrived home from the hospital early Tuesday morning, December 4th. She saw his cab arrive from her upstairs window, and let their dog Shandar down the stairs into their narrow hallway to greet Vaughn &mdash; as the dog always did. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know there was a cop in the hallway,&rdquo; Sonja said. Vaughn heard the shots as he stepped onto the porch. &ldquo;I just see the cop standing there and my dog laying there all bloody. I just said &lsquo;you killed my dog,&rsquo; and he didn&rsquo;t say nothing,&rdquo; Vaughn said. A Milwaukee Police Department spokeswoman sent FOX6 News a statement saying the veteran officer was at the home to do a welfare check on Vaughn because Sonja had called earlier about him having inhaled glue. When the officer arrived, he knocked on the door, and announced he was a police officer, before he heard barking and went back down the stairs. The statement goes on to say the officer: &ldquo;shouted for Sonja to grab the dog. The dog charged down the stairs, tail down, showing teeth and gums and growled at the officer, coming straight toward him. Officers are trained to stop the threat. The officer had no means of escape, and fearing for his safety, discharged his gun until the threat was stopped.&rdquo; Waukesha County Technical College Dean of Criminal Justice Brian Dorow says officers only have a split second to react in these types of situations. &ldquo;If they perceive that threat, they are justified to take actions and protect themselves,&rdquo; Dorow said. Sonja said she never heard anyone downstairs. Vaughn says the glue situation was a mistake he is embarrassed about. Both of the Schroeders feel it has nothing to do with how Shandar died. &ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t understand. There couldn&rsquo;t have been some other course of action he could have taken?&rdquo; Sonja said. &ldquo;They killed my dog. That&rsquo;s all I have to say,&rdquo; Vaughn said.

Good Samaritan citizens attempted to get the attackers off the little dog but were put in danger along with small children and other adults in the park. Police tried to pepper-spray the worst of the two, but when it made its third return to attack the helpless prey, Patrol Officer Mark Bunting put a bullet from his .40-caliber Glock pistol behind its right ear, reported Detective Sgt. Pedro Medina, Trenton police spokesman. Animal Control Officer Jason Riley disposed of the remains. Nobody in authority could tell The Trentonian what happened to the second pit bull. A police report did not identify the owner of the dogs or say whether charges are forthcoming. The owners of the little dog, Michelle Williams, 51, and Charles Page, were said by a neighbor and friend to have been unable to pay the $1,000-a-night fee for treatment at a veterinary hospital and are trying to bring it back to health at home. Medina said the animal bled profusely from bites on its head, facial area and three of its limbs. Another human victim, Michael Levine, was bitten on the right hand after the pit bull broke free from his grip. Medina said Levine refused hospital treatment. Witnesses called and told The Trentonian that the pit bulls &quot;attacked another dog and ripped him apart&quot; in the incident. High-visibility police patrols in the 400 block of Hamilton Avenue were flagged down by Michelle Williams in the first block of Division Street, waving her arms and crying hysterically in the middle of the street, screaming, &quot;Hurry, please help!&quot; Medina said. &quot;At that time, the officers saw there were several citizens gathered in a group, and when they (the officers) exited their car, they saw two pit bull dogs attacking a smaller dog, with several citizens attempting to pull the two aggressive dogs off the small dog,&quot; Medina said. &quot;As they approached the group, the citizens were able to successfully separate the dogs,&quot; he said. &quot;Michael Levine picked up one of the pit bulls and started walking toward Division Street, and an unidentified black juvenile was directed by Levine to grab the other pit bull by the leash and was struggling to pull the dog away toward Division Street. &quot;Charles Page was kneeling by the victim dog when suddenly one of the pit bulls broke loose by biting Levine&#039;s right hand and running directly at Page and the smaller dog and began biting it again as Page was still holding it.&quot; Police tried a burst of department-issue pepper spray, but it had no effect on the raging beasts; &quot;they continued to bite at the smaller dog&#039;s neck,&quot; Medina said. Incredibly, the smaller dog broke free from the killer and ran for safety, &quot;but the pit bull quickly started chasing the smaller dog through several small children and citizens who were in the park,&quot; he said. &quot;Citizens became frightened and several then ran in the opposite direction. The pit bull then caught the small dog for the third time and began to attack it in a more aggressive manner. And with no other means available, Officer (Mark) Bunting discharged a single round from his department issue Glock. Killed the dog.&quot; Medina said the small dog ran back to its home on Conrad Street where it resides with Williams and Page.','http://www.trentonian.com/article/TT/20101108/NEWS/311089984','Unknown','Police Officer Michael Bunting and Animal Control Officer Jason Riley','1','0',1,0,0,2,2,'Uniform',3,3,0,0,0,0),(961,'2014-08-21','Arkansas','Alexander','Alexander Police Department',1,2,0,'Unconfirmed','An Alexander woman&#039;s dog was shot by a police chief but both parties are telling different stories.

Now the dog&#039;s owner, Randy Ward, is speaking out against police, saying they should&#039;ve handled the situation differently and is looking for answers. Ward said he wasn&#039;t home when his neighbor called 911 to report his four dogs were fighting, three of them specifically attacking and seriously injuring the other dog. &quot;It&#039;s like somebody just came in and shot one of my kids,&quot; Ward said. &quot;I&#039;m upset, I think it could&#039;ve been handled in a more professional way, and he wouldn&#039;t have had to shoot my dog.&quot;  Benton Police said they went to Ward&#039;s home after a 911 call came in about his four dogs, a mastiff and three dobermans, fighting in the front yard. When police tried to separate the injured dog from the others, police said one of the dogs started to attack the Animal Control Officers. &quot;The officer had no choice but to discharge his weapon toward the dog, one time,&quot; said Lt. Kevin Russell, Benton Police Department. &quot;If they hadn&#039;t come into the yard, they could&#039;ve used a tranquilizer gun, or if they would&#039;ve just had some way of calling the fire department and spray water on them,&quot; Ward said. It&#039;s one of the ways Ward says works when breaking up a fight between his dogs. Ward&#039;s neighbor Theresa Dennie has seen the dogs fight before, but not to this extent. So she picked up the phone and called 911. &quot;It was very bad. It was something from a Stephen King Cujo movie,&quot; Dennie said. &quot;His mouth was clamped on his throat and then he started draggin him through the yard.&quot; While the injured dog is now back home, he&#039;s still recovering from puncture wounds and cuts. While it&#039;s proof it&#039;s not playful, Ward assures his dogs are not vicious.\r\n&quot;These dogs have never showed any aggression to any people. People come by and pet them and give them treats,&quot; Ward said.

Officers responded to 608 Carbon St. at about 1:30 p.m. after receiving a report of a possible burglary in progress, Syracuse police said. Officers had responded to the address Friday night for a possible burglary in progress, but couldn&#039;t confirm a burglary had taken place or find the homeowner. A K-9 officer, his dog and another officer arrived at the scene and began checking the outside of the house for signs of forced entry. They found a basement door that was open. The K-9 officer stood near the door with his leashed dog and announced himself. While the officers were still outside the house, a pit bull came through the basement door and attacked the police dog, police said. The officers unsuccessfully tried to get the pit bull to release its bite on the police dog, police said. At the same time, a man armed with an AR-15 rifle came out another door of the house and walked toward the officers. They drew their weapons and ordered the man to drop the rifle, which he did. He was briefly detained. Then the officers immediately turned their attention back to the pit bull, which still had a grip on the police dog. After several more tries to get the pit bull to let go of the police dog, the K-9 officer shot the pit bull once, police said. The pit bull held onto the police dog for about a minute after being shot, but finally released its grip, police said. The pit bull died at the scene. The police dog sustained what appeared to be minor injuries, but will have a veterinary check on Monday. The man who approached with the rifle was identified as Gaetano Colozzi, 23. Police said Colozzi lives at 608 Carbon St. and was not charged in the incident. Nicholas Bartell, who shares the house at 608 Carbon St. with Colozzi, said he owns the pit bull that was killed Saturday. He said Colozzi had earlier invited two women over, who used the basement door to enter the house. Reached by phone on vacation, Bartell said a neighbor who witnessed the incident called him to tell him his 10-month-old pit bull was dead. Bartell said neighbors told him that the police dog attacked his pit bull, not the other way around, and that his dog tried to get away from the police dog. He said the pit bull is very tame and hasn&#039;t bit anyone in the past. Officers later determined that there was not a burglary in progress, but did secure the AR-15 and another rifle for safekeeping because the owner could not be immediately found, police said. Neither the officers or Colozzi were injured.','http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2013/06/syracuse_police_dog_shoot.html','Unknown','Two Unknown Police and Unknown Police K-9','2','0',2,0,0,0,2,'Uniform',2,2,0,0,2,0),(964,'2014-03-26','Ohio','Toledo','Toledo Police Department',2,2,0,'Unconfirmed','Toledo Police say one of their officers shot and killed a dog in south Toledo Wednesday evening.

Police say they were called at about 4:30 p.m. Wednesday about an intoxicated person trying to board a bus with an aggressive pit bull at the corner of North Lombard and Interstate. Officers heading to the scene were told the dog tried to attack a person in the area. Shortly after police arrived, the pit bull charged an officer and was fatally shot, authorities say. Jennifer Conway was working at a nearby gas station when she witnessed the shooting. &quot;I was inside the store helping a customer and I turned around and the doors to the store were open and I heard two shots. All I saw was the dog sitting there flinching and the officer had his gun, holding it over the dog,&quot; she said. Police identified the dog&#039;s owner as Richard Cook, 61. He is described as a transient who frequents the area. Cook was arrested on suspicion of reckless endangering, interfering with a peace officer, menacing and disorderly conduct in the second-degree. &quot;I&#039;ve been working here for 14 months. So, I&#039;ve known the dog for 14 months, as well. We feed the dog and we give the dog water every time it comes in and he&#039;s super friendly. He&#039;s never been aggressive toward anyone,&quot; Conway says. Police say the shooting is unfortunate and that even good dogs can be unpredictable. But people familiar with the dog are outraged. &quot;That just seems extreme and it&#039;s unfortunate because he was like a poodle, unfortunately, in a pit bull body and that is where it went wrong,&quot; says Deborah Sampson, who knew the dog. The use of force will be investigated internally, but the officer will not be put on leave. The dog shot by police bit two people late last year in Southeast Portland, including a 2-year-old girl and a skateboarder.\r\nIn a third incident in June, Multnomah County Animal Services advised the dog&#039;s owner, 61-year-old Richard Cook,  to keep the dog muzzled at all times, but he refused and was cited. Wednesday&#039;s shooting unfolded shortly after an apparently intoxicated transient, later identified as Cook, tried to board a bus with the pit bull about 4:30 p.m. at North Lombard Street and Interstate Avenue. As officers headed to the scene, they heard the dog had tried to attack someone, said Lt. Robert King, a Police Bureau spokesman.\r\nWhen they arrived at 4:40 p.m., the pit bull went after Officer Aaron Dauchy, who evaded it without injury, King said. When it charged again, Dauchy, a 12-year Police Bureau veteran, shot it dead. Cook was arrested and lodged at the Justice Center Jail on four misdemeanor counts: reckless endangerment, interfering with an officer, menacing and disorderly conduct. His bail was set at $9,000. King said under Police Bureau guidelines a supervisor will review the shooting to see if it followed bureau policy.\r\nThursday, the Police Bureau released the dog&#039;s history. All three incidents occurred at Southeast 38th Avenue and Hawthorne Boulevard: Nov. 10, 2010: Police responded to a report of a pit bull that had bitten a 2-year-old girl. Cook was booked into jail on an outstanding warrant and his dog was taken by Multnomah County Animal Services. Dec. 15, 2010: Police responded to a report of a pit bull that had bitten a skateboarder. Police again arrested Cook on an outstanding warrant and the dog again was taken by Animal Services. During this call, police said they learned that the pit bull had been trained as a fighting dog. June 2: Police were called to assist Animal Services officers handling a report of an aggressive dog. Animal Services told Cook that because of the two previous incidents, the pit bull was required to wear a muzzle at all times. Cook refused and was cited for a dog that was a public nuisance. People who knew Cook and the pit bull, named Buddy, said they were regulars in the Hawthorne neighborhood and frequently spent their days sitting at Southeast Hawthorne Boulevard and 38th Avenue. Some people placed flowers on the corner Thursday as a memorial. Peter de Garmo, the owner of Pastaworks on Hawthorne, said Cook liked to read on the corner, encouraged other transients to keep the street clean and rarely panhandled. De Garmo noted he had never seen Buddy act aggressively. Pastaworks employees regularly petted Buddy and gave him water and treats. A Pastaworks employee said people who worked in the area broke down in tears when they heard Buddy had been killed. They were not critical of the officer&#039;s decision to shoot the dog, just upset the incident had happened. De Garmo said Cook and his pet were inseparable. &quot;It&#039;s just a tragedy,&quot; he said. &quot;Here&#039;s a guy who is down on his luck and the one relationship that seemed to sustain him was Buddy.&quot;','http://www.kptv.com/story/15328677/officer-shoots-kills-dog-at-n-portland-max-stop','Buddy','Aaron Dauchy','1','0',2,0,0,1,1,'Uniform',3,3,0,0,0,0),(969,'2010-05-31','Oregon','Portland','Portland Police Department',1,2,1,'Unconfirmed','Portland police say they shot a pit bull to death Monday morning after the dog mauled a man and bit a woman.

Tenant Aaron Palfoss wasn&#039;t home, so police used a janitor&#039;s key to enter. Police spokesman Sgt. Brian Schmautz says the pit bull attacked an officer, who responded by shooting the dog with his taser. Though the initial shock knocked the dog to the floor, it got up and continued to attack the officers, Schmautz says. The cops hit the dog with at least two more taser darts before it collapsed and died. Minutes later, Palfoss returned with a friend, Taylor Brotherton, who says the apartment was strewn with feces from the frightened dog. Palfoss could not be reached for comment. Taser International, the publicly traded Arizona company that manufactures the popular &quot;non-lethal&quot; stun guns, largely bases claims that its product poses no danger to human life on tests performed on pigs and dogs. Edward Jackson, a Washington, D.C.-based taser expert for Amnesty International, says the human-rights group has documented more than 100 taser-related human deaths, though none in Oregon. The Portland Police Bureau owns 270 taser guns, one for every on-duty officer. Oregon State University&#039;s veterinary lab performed a necropsy on the dog. A preliminary report concludes the pit bull died from circulatory collapse but reaches no judgment on whether repeated taser shocks killed it. To Jackson, the idea that a healthy dog just happened to die after being tasered is tough to swallow. &quot;If you can&#039;t say definitively that it played no role, then you have to say that you can&#039;t rule it out,&quot; Jackson says. &quot;You can&#039;t say the dog died of stress when the 800-pound gorilla in the room is what caused the stress.&quot; Police will not release the incident report on the visit to Palfoss&#039; apartment, citing privacy restrictions.

The dog was treated for injuries and is expected to survive, while the animal&rsquo;s owners may face charges in the incident. According to Kingsport Police Department Deputy Chief David Quillin, the incident began Saturday about 8:20 p.m. Central Dispatch received a call of a vicious pit bull having a woman trapped in an automobile outside her home, 1661 Ridgeway Drive. When KPD Officer Seth Brumfield arrived at the scene, the dog had wandered away from the woman&rsquo;s car, and she was able to gain access into her home through the garage. Police said Brumfield encountered the dog in the vicinity of the incident, and animal control was dispatched to come pick up the dog. However, Quillin said that before animal control arrived, the dog became very aggressive, lunging at the officer and then backing away numerous times. When a second officer, Matt Pendleton, arrived at the scene, the dog reportedly became more aggressive and charged police, forcing them to fire at the animal.\r\nQuillin said the dog&rsquo;s owners could not be located at the time, and the dog was transported to Airport Pet Emergency Clinic in Blountville. &ldquo;My understanding this morning is that the dog will probably live,&rdquo; Quillin said Monday. The dog&rsquo;s owners were later identified as Joyce Epps, 30, and Brandon Johnson, 28, both of 1669 Ridgeway Drive. Quillin said an investigation of the incident is continuing, and the two could face charges.\r\nThe dog&rsquo;s owners had the animal admitted to Indian Ridge Animal Hospital in Kingsport. According to Dr. Michael Bunch, the dog has facial injuries and lacerations to one side, but is otherwise doing well. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s unfortunate that it happened, but the officers clearly didn&rsquo;t have any other choice,&rdquo; Quillin said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just grateful there were not any small children or anyone playing (in the area) or this could be a very different story.&rdquo; The incident marks the second time in less than a week that Kingsport police have shot a pit bull. Quillin said this weekend&rsquo;s case is not expected to be handed over to the district attorney&rsquo;s office. He added that besides the two officers at the scene, numerous other residents witnessed the incident and the dog&rsquo;s aggressive actions.

Police say Johnson Johnson stepped over a low wire fence on Derwood Court, and was &quot;charged by three pit bull/bulldog-type dogs.&rdquo; &ldquo;Those dogs charged at him in a very aggressive manner,&rdquo; Quillin said. &ldquo;(Johnson) tried to retreat, but he did not have that opportunity. They continued to charge at him in a very aggressive manner, and that&rsquo;s when he was forced to fire. As a result, one of the pit bulls died.&rdquo; However, the dog&#039;s owner -- and at least two neighbor&#039;s who allegedly witnessed the events -- immediately and vehemently contradicted the KPD&#039;s version of what had occurred. Richie Hammonds, 1005 Derwood Court, No. 4, owned his dog &ldquo;Mace&rdquo; for three years. Contrary to what police reported, he says there were not three dogs in his back yard when Officer Johnson stepped over his fence, but only Mace; his other two dogs remained on the back porch. And while Johnson&rsquo;s report on the incident states he traveled about 20 feet into the fenced-in yard when he encountered the dogs, the alleged witnesses have told the Times-News that he only placed one foot over the fence. &ldquo;He put his foot back outside the fence, pulled out his weapon and shot him,&rdquo; said Jonathan Suit, Hammonds&rsquo; neighbor. &ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t a noise made, the dog wasn&rsquo;t running. It was just walking toward him.&rdquo; &ldquo;The officer stepped over the fence,&rdquo; said Amanda Bellamy, another of Hammonds&rsquo; neighbors. &ldquo;Mace came out of his doghouse, was walking up to (Johnson) to smell him. The officer stepped back out of the fence, pulled his weapon and shot that dog. That dog would not have come out of that fence. It&rsquo;s an electric fence. They&rsquo;re scared to death of it. The dog walked up to him wagging his tail.&rdquo; Hammonds claims that after the shooting, Johnson said &ldquo;I hate pit bulls.&rdquo; Bellamy and Suit told the Times-News that Johnson remarked he, &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t like those damn pit bulls anyway.&rdquo; Another point of contention for those living in the apartment complex is that police say they were chasing a suspect. Witnesses told the Times-News that responding officers warned children playing outside to get back; that they were looking for two suspicious black males. Following the shooting of the dog, Joe Shupe, 27, a white male that lived in one of the apartments, was arrested and charged with resisting and evading arrest. According to the incident report filed by Johnson, police were called to the area after a report of a suspicious person. While that person &mdash; or persons &mdash; was not apprehended, Shupe &ldquo;looked in my direction then proceeded in a fast walk away from me,&rdquo; according to Johnson&rsquo;s report. Johnson says he broadcast a description of Shupe over his radio and was proceeding in the direction Shupe had gone when he stepped into Hammonds&rsquo; fenced-in yard. According to the police report, Shupe was detained by another officer at nearby Carrington Court when the officer &ldquo;observed a male subject running down the hill towards him.&rdquo; Shupe, according to the report, claimed &ldquo;he was running because he was trying to hide from officers and thought there was a warrant out for him.&rdquo; He was arrested and charged with resisting and evading arrest.\r\n&ldquo;They said they were chasing after two black guys,&rdquo; Hammonds said. &ldquo;They just arrested (Shupe) to make themselves look good.&rdquo; Bellamy says Shupe went up the hill behind his apartment where an officer then asked what he was doing. &ldquo;I guess they decided they better take somebody to jail,&quot; Bellamy said. &quot;They got him for resisting and evading arrest. He didn&rsquo;t resist nothing. They didn&rsquo;t chase him.&rdquo; &ldquo;If he was in pursuit of somebody, and the dog was going to try and bite him, he should have shot the dog and went on after who he was going after instead of standing there,&rdquo; Hammonds said. &ldquo;He stood there and said &lsquo;The reason I shot him was because I hate pit bulls.&rsquo; That was his exact words. It took everything I had not to hit that guy.&rdquo;\r\nLess than two months after the incident at Carrington Court, Officer Johnson fatally shot another pit bull. On Aug. 6, following a call of possible drug activity in the parking lot of Wal-Mart on West Stone Drive, police responded to 2425 Jennings Drive. According to KPD Sgt. David Moore, Johnson fired a single round at a pit bull that cornered him and two other officers on the carport of a home. Ultimately, no one at the residence was charged with any offense. Following the killing, KPD handed its reports on the situation over to Sullivan County District Attorney Greeley Wells. Wells then requested the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation look into the incident. Agent Brian Pritchard was responsible for the TBI investigation and provided a report to DA Wells. Wells referred the matter to a Sullivan County grand jury in December 2009 who ultimately declined to press charges against Johnson. When Pritchard testified before the grand jury he critiqued witness statements that contradicted Darrell Johnson&#039;s version of events, calling them self-contradictory. Pritchard did not elaborate on why witnesses contradicted themselves. He also did not explain why every witness statement taken contradicted Johnson&#039;s story. The grand jury was not also not told that Johnson killed another dig two months after the shooting related to their indictment. &ldquo;The officer&rsquo;s actions were reasonable under all of the circumstances,&rdquo; said the district attorney responsible for prosecuting Johnson.','http://www.timesnews.net/article/9014873/kingsport-police-shoot-pit-bull-after-it-traps-woman-in-car-charges-officers','Mace','Darrell Johnson TBI Agent Brian Pritchard and Sullivan County District Attorney Greeley Wells','2','0',1,0,0,0,2,'Uniform',0,2,0,0,2,0),(975,'2009-08-08','Tennessee','Kingsport','Kingsport Police Department',1,2,1,'Unconfirmed','On Aug. 6, following a call of possible drug activity in the parking lot of Wal-Mart on West Stone Drive, police responded to 2425 Jennings Drive.

But when he heard the sound of a window sliding open, the 24-year-old got up. Conger&rsquo;s 100-pound pit-bull mix, Cupid, slid into the living room ahead of him. Moments later, the black and white dog was dead, shot by Huntington Beach police officers who had entered the rose-covered double-wide without a warrant. As Cupid turned the corner, making his way toward the noise, Conger said he heard what sounded like three gunshots. He rushed to the scene where he was met with three police officers, his dog lying in a corner. &ldquo;It really didn&rsquo;t make any sense to me,&rdquo; Conger said. Huntington Beach police were unavailable for comment at the time of publication. He added that he did not remember hearing a bark when Cupid went ahead of him into the living room. Had he known police were in the house, Conger said, he would have kept the dog in the bedroom.\r\n&ldquo;Before he got out into the living room the dog was shot and killed,&rdquo; said Conger&rsquo;s father, Robert Conger. &ldquo;And the police officers had gone into the house.&rdquo; Police threw him on the ground and handcuffed him, Casey Conger said. Conger was told that he was under arrest for sicking the dog on the cops, who later un-cuffed then re-cuffed him. Conger told NBCLA.com that he sat in the police car for about an hour and a half before being released.\r\nCasey Conger raised the 3-year-old dog since it was a puppy and said Cupid was attached to him wherever he went. Cupid would bark at strangers, but never physically attacked anyone, Conger added. &ldquo;I can handle what they do to me, but I love that dog,&rdquo; Casey Conger said. &ldquo;What do you expect a dog to do when you come in through the window?&rdquo; Police came in through a plexiglass window, which, Casey Conger said, would be easy to jimmy open but was definitely locked. &ldquo;My heater&rsquo;s broken, so the night before I went through the house and made sure all the windows were closed and locked,&rdquo; he said.\r\nNeighbor Vince Ransom said he came home to find four police cars and several undercover officers at the scene. A month earlier, he said, officers had threatened to shoot Casey Conger&#039;s dog. &quot;A month earlier they came out to the house, and they said, &#039;Why don&#039;t we just shoot the dog?&#039;&quot; Ransom said. &quot;Then yesterday, they came out and they shot the dog.&quot; The Huntington Beach police department, which is investigating the incident, said in a press release that officers had responded to reports that transients were living in an abandoned trailer at the Ocean View Estates Mobile Home Park. &ldquo;Police officers knocked on the doors and windows and yelled inside, but received no response,&rdquo; Lt. Russell Reinhard said in the press release. &ldquo;They entered the trailer and were charged by a pit-bull terrier dog that weighed about 100 pounds. The police officers feared for their safety and one police officer fired his handgun, striking the dog and killing it.&rdquo; Reinhard repeatedly referred to the property as abandoned, and made a reference to Robert Conger as its former owner. Along with the police was an investigator for the city of Huntington Beach, which in an unusual arrangement actually owns the mobile home park. Huntington Beach Lt. John Cottriel, reached by telephone on Friday, said the police department was investigating the incident. He would not comment further. Ransom, the family&#039;s longtime neighbor, said the home was well-kept, and that no one stayed there when Casey Conger was away.\r\nRobert Conger said he and his wife have owned the mobile home in the park for twelve years. They rent the plot where it is located from the city. The family is behind on its $314 monthly rent to the city, but just by one month, Conger said. The elder Congers moved to Sacramento three years ago, but their son continued to live there, Robert Conger said, with the full knowledge of neighbors and the local police. Far from being abandoned, Robert Conger said, the property has a barbecue out front. Over Thanksgiving, he drove down from Sacramento, trimming roses and helping a neighbor put up Christmas lights. His son, Conger said, has had some difficulties, including teen-age drug issues and an encounter with police last month. But that didn&rsquo;t give officers the right to climb in through Casey&rsquo;s window and shoot his dog. &ldquo;My son didn&rsquo;t deserve this,&rdquo; Conger said.','http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Police-Kill-Pit-Bull-135318658.html','Cupid','Three Unknown Police','2','0',2,0,0,0,2,'Uniform',2,2,0,0,2,0),(977,'2011-12-12','Mississippi','Gulfport','Gulfport Police Department',1,2,1,'Unconfirmed','On Monday afternoon, one family&#039;s Pit bull was shot and killed in his own yard.

It was reported that these dogs had killed a cat, had menaced some children, and one individual jumped on the hood of his car when he saw the dogs running loose. When the Police arrived on scene, they snared the dogs, placed them in the back of a van commonly used to transport prisoners, took them to a remote location near the City&#039;s incinerator. Once they arrived at the incinerator, the dogs were removed from the van, each dog was then shot in the head, and their bodies are believed to have been thrown into the City&#039;s incinerator.The dog&#039;s owner had left them in his yard, which was enclosed in a 6 foot wooden fence, while he went to work for the day.\r\nWhen he returned home, he noticed that the gate was open and his dogs were gone. He immediately called 911 to report them missing and then set about making a flier and posting it throughout the Midtown and Uptown areas of Harrisburg. For the next several days, the owner continually called the City Police to see if his dogs and been located and scoured the City looking for his dogs. Sometime the following Tuesday, the story about what had happened to the dogs was leaked to the Media. After the story broke, that City of Harrisburg Police contacted the dogs owner to tell them that they had &quot;euthanized&quot; his dogs. The owner was told the information provided above and when he asked where his dogs bodies were, he was denied an answer. \r\nThe owner distraught and frustrated, went to the media and subsequently found himself arrested on an old warrant from 2008. The warrant was served and it should be noted that the owner had the same address and phone number and was unaware that the warrant was pending. The Harrisburg City Police then began a media campaign letting it be known that new charges were pending on the dogs owner for the City Police shooting his dogs. The charges alleged were that the dogs were not vaccinated-this later turned out to be untrue, that he had let us dogs run loose, and that they were not licensed with the City which is a $6.00 yearly fee. Pennsylvania state law requires all animals to be held for a period of 48 hours. The purpose of this is two-fold. One reason is so their rightful owner may have the time needed to locate them. The other reason is that a behavioral evaluation, by a trained specialist, could be conducted. This requirement also extends to animals deemed &quot;dangerous&quot;. The City could have made arrangements to house the animals with the following means: The Carriage House (a stable owned and operated by the City&#039;s Animal Control Officer), one of the many K9&#039;s units the City currently has in operation, placing a call to a local rescue, or contacting neighboring Police Department (Susquehanna Township) who has kennel space.

For several days, the police had been looking for the pit-bull-type canine after having received a number of complaints. When they arrived they found the dog, which appeared to be &quot;dying on the ground,&quot; at the Green Street School playground, according to a press release from the police department. &quot;The officers used their years of training and experience and made a decision to put the dog down,&quot; Chief Gene Wrinn told the Reformer on Wednesday. The officers had to shoot the dog twice to kill it. It was sent to a state lab for testing, which determined the dog was not rabid. Wrinn said the town&#039;s animal control officer was not available at the time, so the officers had to use their best judgment. &quot;If they didn&#039;t take this action and if that dog had remained loose and had bit someone, who knows what might have happened?&quot; But a resident of the neighborhood, who was on the playground at that time with her husband, their two children, a friend and two other children, believes the officers could have dealt with the situation in a better way. &quot;I&#039;m certainly not going to against the decision they made at the time,&quot; said Isabel Matweecha, &quot;but there could have been better communication between the officers and the people present.&quot; Matweecha said for a number of days following the shooting she was angry and didn&#039;t understand why the officers had to do what they did. Now, she said, she and her family just want to put the trauma of that day behind them. &quot;We felt totally in the dark,&quot; said Matweecha. &quot;There was next to no communication about what was going on.&quot; A few minutes before the shooting, Matweecha and her group were at the Crowell Lot, where the officers told them they were looking for the dog, which they described as not aggressive, but warned them not to approach it if they saw it. They then went down to the playground and the officers arrived shortly thereafter, said Matweecha, and drew their guns. Matweecha, her family and friends were leaving the playground when the shots rang out. &quot;And after all that happened, neither officer came around front to check in on us or let us know what happened,&quot; she said. &quot;It just didn&#039;t seem professional.&quot; Wrinn confirmed that the people on the playground &quot;self-evacuated&quot; when the police arrived. &quot;It&#039;s obviously not ideal that it happened at the school, but that&#039;s where the dog was,&quot; he said. Matweecha said she hopes the police department uses this incident as an opportunity to train its officers in how to best respond to similar situations, including communicating with people in the vicinity and making better use of its animal control officer. &quot;If they really felt and believed that this dog was a threat and could harm us, then they could have told us it was not a good time to go to the playground,&quot; she said. &quot;Things could have been done differently.&quot; By town ordinance, dog owners are required to license their pets at the Town Clerk&#039;s office on an annual basis. They are also required to have control of the dog at all times.

Over the summer, the dog had been in a fight with a skunk and began displaying unusual behavior like acting aggressive and biting.\r\nMichelob&#039;s owner said a female police officer arrived to euthanize Michelob. The dogs owner, Jan Brown, who lives on Morningside Drive, said she remembers the police officer shot Michelob 13 times. Brown thinks authorities should have tried to tranquilize or quarantine Michelob.\r\nThe bullets rang out in sets of three, six and four, according to Brown. Many of the bullets hit Michelob in the gut, instead of the heart. Brown believes the officer kept shooting after the dog died but before it stopped twitching from nerves. Since this ordeal, Brown said she&#039;s suffered anxiety attacks. Brown said neighbors were drawn to the commotion thinking there might be a mass shooting going on in the neighborhood. Before the fight with the skunk Michelob was a loving dog, Brown said. &quot;I&#039;ve never seen anything so bad in my life,&quot; said Brown who owned Michelob with her fiance, Jeff. &quot;I constantly hear every shot in my mind.&quot; Brown&#039;s account differs from police chief Philip Weymouth&#039;s version of the story. Weymouth said the officer probably only had six bullets. The officer couldn&#039;t shoot Michelob in the head because the brain needed to be preserved for testing. Calls to Weymouth for this story were unreturned by press time. The test for rabies ultimately came up negative, meaning the dog did not have rabies, said Hoenig. Weymouth, a self-described animal lover, said the events that day were unfortunate and he hopes never to have that happen again. Since then, a new policy for handle such situations has been created that involves someone authorized to use a dart gun and tranquilizer.

Police did not identify the man who was shot, but a witness to part of the incident said it was Martin Ruiz, 18. Police and District Attorney investigators are on scene in the 1100 block of Shelton Street. The man ran from police after he was approached over a suspected probation violation, police said. He was shot and killed at a neighbor&#039;s home, police said. Cpl. Anthony Bertagna of the Santa Ana Police Department said the man was on probation for a weapons violation. After officers approached him, he ran home and released a pit bull, Bertagna said. The dog attacked the officers, and the man ran off to another home four doors down, Bertagna said. Police shot the dog, and continued after the man, Bertagna said. There was an altercation at the neighbor&#039;s home, shots were fired and the man was killed, Bertagna said. There was a weapon found next to the man&#039;s body, Bertagna said, adding that he didn&#039;t know what sort. No officers were injured in the shooting, police said. The number of shots fired and how many officers were involved has not yet been disclosed. Anabel Gil, 22, who lives in the neighborhood, said the man was her 18-year-old cousin, Martin Ruiz. She said she saw her cousin run but the dog did not provoke the officers. &quot;The dog didn&#039;t attack,&quot; she said. &quot;He was barking (because) the police just came inside.&quot; Gil said her cousin ran from the police and jumped the fence into her neighbor&#039;s yard. She said her cousin had nowhere to go and she heard shots being fired. &quot;That&#039;s what upsets me.... He was cornered and had no where to go,&quot; she said. &quot;They don&#039;t want to give us any updates. They just keep pushing us back and that&#039;s what makes me think that there was something wrong.&quot; Gil said her neighborhood is swarming with police officers but her family has been given little information about the incident. Four hours after the shooting, Gil still did not have any information. Neighbors who lived on Shelton Street were told by police they would have to wait up to seven hours before re-entering their homes. A 19-year-old named Martin Ruiz is currently wanted on misdemeanor warrants for grafitti and possession of ammunition. [end of news transcript]\r\nLater, more details emerged. The teenager was approached by two Gang Suppression unit police who told him he had violated his probation. The teen ran. Chasing him to his house, they encountered the dog, which they shot. They continued chasing the boy, finally killing him four houses away from his own. The police claim to have found a knife next to his body. There was a lawsuit against the city, Police Chief Paul M Walter and the two un-named cops who were directly responsible for the killing. Lawyers for the estate of Martin Ruiz asserted in a federal civil rights lawsuit that cops attempted to arrest Ruiz &quot;without reasonable suspicion or probable cause&quot; and then repeatedly shot him in displays of &quot;excessive deadly force.&quot; City officials initially reacted to the December 2011 lawsuit filed at Orange County&#039;s Ronald Reagan Federal Courthouse by denying any wrongdoing and declaring that officers have &quot;complete immunity&quot; to kill citizens. But that stance may not have prevailed after a thorough review of the evidence. January of 2013, the city agreed to a pre-trial settlement before a jury could hear the case in U.S. District Court Judge David O. Carter&#039;s courtroom.

But Remedios then identified himself as a South San Francisco police officer and said &quot;step aside&quot; before shooting Angel, the suit said. Remedios &quot;instantly came to the conclusion that plaintiff&#039;s dog was out of control and deadly force was initiated,&quot; said Halteh&#039;s lawsuit, filed last week in U.S. District Court in San Francisco. The sergeant&#039;s dog, Buddy, received &quot;little, if any, medical veterinary treatment and displayed no visual evidence of injury,&quot; the suit said. Police Chief Mark Raffaelli and City Attorney Steven Mattas said Friday that the city conducted an internal investigation into the shooting and found no wrongdoing on the part of Remedios. The sergeant, Raffaelli and the city of South San Francisco are named as defendants in the suit. Raffaelli said another sergeant who was not involved in the case received a death threat as a result of the incident. The source of the threat, who hasn&#039;t been identified, had mistaken that sergeant for Remedios, the chief said. Safire said Remedios overreacted. &quot;If I came home and my dog was fighting with another dog and I happened to have a .45 in my pocket, I&#039;d be in jail,&quot; Safire said. &quot;I think it&#039;s an outrage.&quot; Initially city officials launched an internal police investigation of the incident, but then turned the matter over to an independent investigator because of the shooting&rsquo;s &quot;unique&quot; nature, given that an officer&rsquo;s direct family and pet are involved, City Manager Barry Nagel said. The full name of the officer involved in the shooting has not been released by the city and was not reported by the San Francisco Examiner, despite the fact his name was published a month earlier by SFGate.Com and was available in public court documents. Councilmember Mike Addiego said he &quot;cheered&quot; the independent investigation because a third-party opinion should satisfy those &quot;who are going to judge the officer.&quot;','http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Off-duty-police-sergeant-sued-over-shooting-dog-2497381.php','Angel','Mike Remedios','0','0',2,0,0,2,2,'Plain Clothes',3,3,0,0,1,0),(989,'2005-07-27','California','Richmond','Richmond Police Department and Richmond Police Department&rsquo;s Professional  Standards Unit',1,50,1,'Pit Bull 18 months old','The city of Richmond has agreed to pay $225,000 to settle two federal civil rights lawsuits filed in connection with the controversial shooting death of a pit bull. Cynthia Peters and Mark Parr accused officers of acting in &quot;reckless and callous disregard&quot; of their constitutional rights when police shot their 1-1/2-year-old pit bull, Blu, on July 27, 2005. The Richmond City Council agreed to pay $210,000 to the couple and an additional $15,000 to Genevia Walker, a bystander who also sued the city in federal court, saying her neck was burned when three bullet casings fired by an officer hit her neck and left her temporarily unable to hear. &quot;We&#039;re happy with the way the case was resolved,&quot; Karen Snell, an attorney for Peters and Parr, said today. Blu was in the couple&#039;s fenced yard on Sixth Street when the officers opened the gate to pursue a suspect and shot the dog 11 times with pistols and a shotgun. When Parr ran up and asked the officers, &quot;Why&#039;d you shoot my dog?&quot; police &quot;pointed their guns at him, kicked and punched him and threw him to the ground,&quot; according to the lawsuit filed by the couple in U.S. District Court in San Francisco. Police arrested Parr on suspicion of obstructing police officers, but no charges were filed. An internal investigation by the police department found no fault with the officers; the couple appealed. The Police Commission in February 2006 ruled in their favor and attributed Blu&#039;s death to insufficient departmental guidelines for handling such situations. In court papers, the city said &quot;the destruction&quot; of Blu was necessary and therefore reasonable, that the force used against Parr was reasonable and that his arrest was lawful. In an unusual move, Richmond Police Chief Chris Magnus apologized to the couple. Magnus told The Chronicle last year that his apology doesn&#039;t necessarily mean he doesn&#039;t support his officers, but that owning up to Blu&#039;s death was the right thing to do. &quot;Being sorry that something happened doesn&#039;t mean that your people acted in the wrong way,&quot; Magnus said. Richmond police have since drafted a policy specifying when officers can use deadly force against dogs and provided training on how to deal with dogs in general. The city paid more than $500,000 in 1998 in connection with a lawsuit over another &quot;unnecessary shooting&quot; of a dog named Champ that belonged to James Fuller. Officers entered his yard in 1991 to speak with Fuller and shot the dog during the exchange. &quot;They did nothing to change their policy until the new chief came along,&quot; said Snell, who nevertheless applauded the city for outlining a policy that bars officers from shooting a dog &quot;if there are nonlethal alternatives.&quot; Attorneys for the city of Richmond did not immediately respond to requests for comment today. Richmond City Councilman Tom Butt said today, &quot;It is regretful that the city was so slow to learn. The adage &#039;once burned, twice shy&#039; suggests that when someone has had a bad experience, he or she is likely to shy away from being in the same position again, having better learned to deal with similar situations. &quot;Previous chiefs did not learn. Magnus made the correction to the policy. I think he did the right thing by apologizing.&quot; Lawsuit information is as follows: \r\nCYNTHIA PETERS and MARK PARR vs CITY OF RICHMOND, ACTING CHIEF TERRY HUDSON, individually and in his official capacity; ACTING INTERIM CHIEF EUGENE MCBRIDE, individually and in his official capacity; CHIEF CHRIS MAGNUS, in \r\nhis official capacity; SGT.

A lawyer for club members says a lot of property was destroyed in the raids and some evidence was kept for more than a year.&rdquo; (AP/CNN, Feb. 7). &ldquo;Although they had a week to plan for the raids and knew of the existence of guard dogs, including a Rottweiler, the San Jose police officers failed to do anything to find a non-lethal way of incapacitating the animals, the courts said.&rdquo; (Barry Witt, &ldquo;Hells Angels win nearly $1 million from Santa Clara County&rdquo;, San Jose Mercury News, Feb. 6). More than half the settlement, $530,000, will go to the lawyers representing the club, with the remaining $460,000 to be divided up among victims of the raid.&quot;&quot; The Opinion filed by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in Case number CV-99-20022-JF (see puppycideDB&#039;s FOIA documents section) is more detailed: &quot;&quot;On August 24, 1997, Kevin Sullivan was beaten to death at the Pink Poodle nightclub in San Jose. Linderman of the Santa Clara County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office led the murder investigation. He ultimately determined that Steve Tausan, one of the\r\nnightclub&rsquo;s bouncers and a member of the San Jose Charter of the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club (&ldquo;SJHA&rdquo;), committed the crime. Linderman also suspected other SJHA members and associates of concealing evidence of the murder. The District Attorney&rsquo;s Office charged Tausan with the murder of Kevin Sullivan. On October 6, 1997, Linderman applied for a warrant to search the SJHA clubhouse and the residences of various individuals alleged to be affiliated with the Hells Angels. On the basis of Linderman&rsquo;s 27-page affidavit and the testimony of confidential informants, Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge John Ball issued the search warrants on the same day, authorizing a search of the clubhouse and the individual residences for a security videotape depicting the beating of Sullivan, financial records connecting the Hells Angels to the Pink Poodle, and notes of a Hells Angels\r\nmeeting held five nights after the killing. Police investigative officers recovered meeting minutes after several exhaustive searches, but failed to find the alleged videotape. In January 1998, the District Attorney&rsquo;s Office sought a second set of search warrants for nine residences and the SJHA clubhouse. In support of the application for the second set of warrants, Linderman submitted a 24-page affidavit, which incorporated his October 6, 1997 affidavit. Judge Ball issued the warrants as requested on January 20, 1998. The ten warrants were substantially identical except for the location\r\nand the name of the resident. The second set of warrants again authorized the seizure of a copy of the security videotape, and notes or records of a Hells Angels meeting held on the Friday following the murder of Sullivan. Judge Ball also authorized a search for evidence that showed indicia of Hells Angels affiliation, including &ldquo;any evidence of membership in, affiliation with, activity of, or identity of, any gang, including but not limited to, any reference to &lsquo;Hells Angels.&rsquo; &rdquo; The purpose of this provision in the warrants was to obtain evidence supporting a street gang sentencing enhancement against Tausan under California Penal Code &sect; 186.22 because, allegedly, the murder had been committed in furtherance of the criminal\r\nconduct of the Hells Angels &ldquo;gang.&rdquo; Prior to the January 1998 searches, the Sheriff&rsquo;s Office had arranged for assistance from multiple law enforcement agencies, including the San Jose City Police Department. There were two types of law-enforcement teams that assisted with the execution of the warrants. First, &ldquo;entry teams&rdquo; composed of San Jose City police officers were used to enter the premises surrounding the residences and secure safe entry into the residences. Once the location was secured, &ldquo;search teams&rdquo; composed only of officers from the Sheriff&rsquo;s Office were to conduct the searches and take possession of property covered by the warrant. Leaders of the entry teams were given approximately one-week advance notice of the action in order to prepare for the searches. At 7:00 a.m. on the morning of January 21, 1998, teams of law enforcement officers simultaneously served the search warrants at residences of members of the Hells Angels in various\r\nparts of Santa Clara and Santa Cruz counties. It is the conduct of the law enforcement personnel in carrying out these searches under the second set of warrants that gave rise to plaintiffs&rsquo; claims. 1) Souza Residence - The entry operation at the Souza home was supervised by Sergeant Decena, who learned about the search a week prior to the operation. Officer Newman supervised the search of Souza&rsquo;s residence. He obtained Souza&rsquo;s arrest record, which revealed that Souza had been arrested for weapons and narcotics charges. The team also received background information which showed that there were two guard dogs, one which was a Rottweiler, at the Souza residence. During surveillance before the search, the SJPOs saw a sign on Souza&rsquo;s side gate stating &ldquo;Warning Property Protected By Guard Dog;&rdquo; the officers also learned that Souza owned a Rottweiler that was known to attack without provocation. [...] The SJPOs planned either to isolate or to shoot the dogs, so they would not threaten the safety of the primary entry team. The officers had no plan to use non-lethal methods of incapacitation; nor did they have a specific plan for &ldquo;isolating&rdquo; the dogs or any intention of giving Souza the opportunity to isolate his Rottweiler himself. On the day of the search, the primary entry team entered through the front door of the main house while the secondary team unsuccessfully tried to cut the lock on the side gate with bolt cutters. The secondary team&rsquo;s failure to gain entry through the gate caused them to enter the main house following the first team, at which point the secondary team informed the first team that they had failed to gain access to the backyard through the side gate. Although both teams were safely inside the house, the backyard remained unsecured and the dogs remained on the loose. We note, however, that because Souza was not home the teams could have conducted their search inside the house without hurriedly dealing with the dogs in the backyard. house, two of the officers proceeded to patrol the yard to look for the Rottweiler. Because misc objects and machinery strewn across the yard created obstacles to both motion and sight, the officers kept their firearms (MP-5) drawn. Then, according to Officer Manion: &quot;[t]he [R]ottweiler suddenly appeared around the corner, approaching from the west at a distance of about ten to fifteen feet. It looked at me, gave a low growl, and started advancing toward me. I feared that the dog was going to attack me and I immediately discharged my firearm pulling the trigger twice.&quot; Officer Manion&rsquo;s shots killed the Rottweiler instantly. The SJPOs left unharmed a small white dog that was also present but was judged to pose no threat once the Rottweiler had been killed. 2) Vieira Residence - Sergeant Carney supervised the search operation for the Vieira residence and was given about a week to plan the\r\nsearch. Like Souza, the Vieiras had not been accused of any crime. Officer Messier, the team leader, conducted surveillance and gathered intelligence several days prior to the operation which revealed that: (1) Robert Vieira had prior weapons-related convictions; (2) the Vieira property included\r\na residence and a junkyard completely encircled by a tall, padlocked, cyclone fence, and (3) there might be dogs, although the number and breed were unknown. Messier assigned Officer Nieves the task of handling any dogs that might be present. The plan for entering the property was to cut the lock on the outer fence, approach the house, give knock-notice, then enter and secure the house. At the Santa Clara Sheriff&rsquo;s Office briefing on the morning of the operation, Sergeant Carney was told that the Vieira property, in particular, was guarded by three large dogs. Officer Nieves, who was assigned the duty of protecting the entry team, planned to deal with the dogs in the following manner: First, he hoped that the dogs would not appear at the gate. If they did, he planned to poke them through the fence with his\r\nshotgun and try to scare them. (Nieves carried a shotgun specifically for dogs.) If that did not work, he planned to assess the situation and\r\nengage the dogs, to ensure the safety of the entry team. Because the SJPOs believed that they needed to secure quick entry to preserve an element of surprise and prevent the possible destruction of evidence, they had no intention of calling on the Vieiras to control their dogs. When the entry team approached the Vieiras&rsquo; gate, three large dogs resembling Bullmastiffs emerged and ran toward the gate barking and growling. As the officers stuck their hands through the fence to cut the lock, one of the dogs jumped and snapped at their hands. Although the SJPOs were armed with pepper spray, no officer attempted to use the spray to subdue the dogs.8 Instead, Officer Nieves attempted to scare the dogs away by yelling at them and pushing one of the dogs back with the barrel of his shotgun. The dogs, however, would not retreat, and the persistent barking caused Officer Nieves to fear that the surprise of the mission might be compromised. Officer Nieves pointed his shotgun at one of the barking dogs and shot it. The first dog went down, but the second dog did not retreat. Officer Nieves shot at the second dog twice,\r\ncritically wounding it, causing it and the third dog to retreat. Although he had already shot the first dog at point blank range, Officer Nieves testified that the dog &ldquo;was apparently trying to get back up [a]nd in an effort to ensure that he wasn&rsquo;t going to attack or be a problem for the team,&rdquo; Officer Nieves fired a fourth shot at the dog&rsquo;s head, killing it. The\r\nSJPOs left unharmed the third dog, which retreated to a hiding place away from the officers, and the fourth dog, which was chained in the backyard.\r\nMeanwhile, the noise outside awoke Robert Vieira. He emerged from the house at the second floor balcony just as the officers gained entry through the gate. The police instructed him to remain where he was with his hands up. An\r\nofficer broke through the front door using a ram. When the SJPOs reached Robert Vieira, they located a firearm propped up against the bedroom window.&quot;&quot; The court documents go on to detail how everything with a Hells Angels logo on it was stolen, including the following: belts, jewelry, plaques, t-shirts, hats, watches, vests, calendars, clocks, sculptures, photographs, correspondence, motorcycles, a mailbox, a refrigerator\r\ndoor with decals, and a cement portion of the driveway in front of the clubhouse containing the signatures of Hells Angels members.','http://overlawyered.com/2006/02/hells-angels-get-990-k-for-dead-dogs/','Unknown','Sgt Decena, Sgt Opinion Carney, Ofcr Messier, Ofcr Nieves, Ofcr Michael Fernandez, Ofcr William Manion, Ofcr D.

While the officers were in the front yard of 335 South, looking over the vacant premises, the dog entered the backyard &quot;and made a beeline for the officers,&quot; Chief Larry Eggert said Sunday. The dog broke through a locked gate between the front and back yards, tearing out several fasteners as it did, then jumped at one of the officers and tried to bite his face. Mace was sprayed at the dog and officers said it had no effect, as the attack continued, Eggert said. The other officer drew his weapon and shot the dog at least once, possibly twice. The dog then turned on that officer, sinking its teeth into the officer&#039;s bulletproof vest and tearing it. One or two more shots were fired and the dog was killed. Both officers ended up shooting the dog to protect themselves and each other, according to Eggert.\r\n&quot;It was a pretty violent attack,&quot; he said. &quot;There was no stopping that dog.&quot;\r\nSome neighborhood residents were upset with the officers after the shooting, but initial investigation of the incident supports the officers&#039; actions, the chief said. &quot;On our first look at this, it seems like the officers did what they were trained to do. They were being attacked,&quot; he said. The department&#039;s inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the shooting will pick up again today.

On Saturday, city animal control officer Joanie Black responded to the scene and determined that the dog was not licensed.

The bullet that went through Carley&#039;s cheek remains embedded in her shoulder. While the shoulder wound gapes open, Carley&#039;s face is swathed in bandages to provide pressure to prevent additional bleeding. Her owner, Ashley Seidel, 29, of Marshfield can&#039;t afford the medical care her dog needs after it was shot by a Wood County Sheriff&#039;s Department deputy. The deputy had responded along with Marshfield Police Department officers to a report that a woman was unconscious and lying on the sidewalk at 5:57 a.m. Sept. 20. When Seidel talked about her dog and the events that led up to Carley being shot, she started to cry. &quot;It&#039;s all my fault,&quot; Seidel says between sobs as she explained that she inadvertently double-dosed herself with over-the-counter sleeping and allergy medication at about 5 a.m. Sept. 20.

I must have been sitting there awhile. &quot;I looked to my side, and I saw there were squad cars and a lot of police. I didn&#039;t hear them say anything and they were walking towards me. I stood up and saw Carley run up. I said, &#039;That&#039;s my dog.

The deputy responded to the report because he was close to the area at the intersection of East Fifth Street and South Cedar Avenue. Tollefson was the first officer on scene and was talking with Seidel while she was sitting on the sidewalk, says Marshfield Police Chief Rick Gramza. According to the reports filed by the three responding MPD officers, Seidel was crying because Tollefson had told her she would be arrested for a warrant because she had outstanding fines she hadn&#039;t paid, says Gramza. As the officers walked towards Tollefson and Seidel, they heard a dog growling and saw it running towards them with teeth bared. The dog leaped at one of the Marshfield officers, who backed up to avoid being bitten, and the dog veered and headed for Tollefson, says Gramza. &quot;A - none of the officers knew whose dog it was. B - they needed to protect Seidel and themselves,&quot; says Gramza.\r\nNone of the reports document that Seidel told the responding officers that the dog was her&#039;s prior to it being shot, says Gramza. &quot;No one was aware the dog was her&#039;s. I feel bad this happened. I know our officers have to protect themselves and the community. When something like this happens, there isn&#039;t a whole lot of time to react when a dog is charging you,&quot; says Gramza. After she was shot, Carley ran toward home yelping and barking, which brought Seidel&#039;s boyfriend to the couple&#039;s front door. &quot;I opened the door, and Carley ran in, and there was blood all over the place,&quot; says John Gates, who added he initially wanted to let the dog back outside in order to clean the dog to find out why she was bleeding. &quot;But there were officers right there at the door yelling at me to not let her out because they would shoot her if I did,&quot; Gates says. Gates said he was dumbfounded as he learned a sheriff&#039;s deputy had shot his beloved pet, and Seidel was being arrested for a warrant related to unpaid fines. &quot;Why didn&#039;t they use a Taser or pepper spray? They didn&#039;t need to shoot her like that,&quot; says Gates. While Seidel was in custody, Gates used every towel he could find in the house to bundle Carley and protect her head while he drove to a veterinarian&#039;s office open for emergencies on a Saturday morning. As the couple describes what happened, Carley sleeps, but it is labored because of the pressure wrap around her head. Her breaths are punctuated with tiny whines and yelps from the pain.\r\n&quot;She&#039;s really a good dog. She&#039;s never been the kind of dog to be barking at other dogs or people walking by the house. I always walk her on a leash, and she&#039;s really obedient. She&#039;d never want to hurt anyone,&quot; says Seidel. The initial visit to clean the wounds, bandage Carley&#039;s head and provide pain medication for the dog, along with a series of antibiotics cost $550. For complete care to mend Carley&#039;s mouth, remove the bullet and repair her shoulder was estimated at the most to cost $3,000, Gates says. Gates says he took Carley home that day without paying the bill. Two days later, on Sept. 22, he took the dog back to the veterinarian&#039;s office to check that her wounds weren&#039;t infected and was told the dog would not be seen until the previous bill was paid. &quot;I had enough money to pay for that day&#039;s bill, but they wouldn&#039;t see her unless I paid off the other bill,&quot; Gates says. The couple is working to keep Carley&#039;s mouth clean while also feeding her dog food that won&#039;t stress her mouth. &quot;It&#039;s so important to make sure there isn&#039;t any food stuck in her teeth because it could cause an infection,&quot; says Seidel. Carley&#039;s head bandages also are changed daily while they make sure she swallows all of her medication. &quot;We&#039;re worried. She needs medical. But I&#039;m back in school, and there&#039;s no extra money,&quot; says Seidel.','http://www.marshfieldnewsherald.com/story/news/local/2014/09/29/owner-dog-shot-police-afford-vet-bills/16451461/','Carley','Shannon Tollefson','0','1',2,0,0,1,1,'Uniform',3,3,0,0,2,0),(999,'2014-04-18','Texas','Austin','Austin Police Department',1,2,1,'Unconfirmed','An East Austin family forced to bury their pit bull Friday night wants to know why Austin police officers shot and killed their pet, instead of using non-lethal force. The Austin Police Department is investigating after it confirms two officers shot and killed a pit bull on Prock Lane, after they say the dog charged at police. According to the APD watch commander, police were responding to an auto theft call on the 4000 block of Prock Lane, just off of Springdale Road around 8:30 pm. According to police, the officers shot and killed the dog from the street after it charged. [The owner] says the dog was retreating into the house when it was shot a second time, ultimately dying on the front stoop. Alicia Guerrero, whose family owned the dog, disputes that narrative. She says the dog was being restrained by a family member when officers arrived, but the man let the dog go when he saw police draw their weapons. &quot;I guess when the cops arrived he was all offensive. He wasn&#039;t ready to attack, but he was ready to bark,&quot; said Guerrero, who also said the pet had never been aggressive toward people before. Guerrero says when the family member holding on to the dog let go, officers shot the animal in the head. She says the dog was retreating to the house when it was shot a second time, ultimately dying on the front stoop. KVUE could not reach APD Saturday for comment on those allegations. &quot;I think they should have used something other than a gun honestly,&quot; said Guerrero. &quot;If he had bite him, then yes I would understand, but he didn&#039;t bite him.&quot;\r\nJulian Reyes, whose dog &#039;Shiner Bock&#039; was shot and killed while APD responded to a call last year, agreed with Guerrero.\r\n\r\n&quot;They&#039;re supposed to use an escalation of force,&quot; said Reyes, who has since become an activist trying to increase accountability for officers accused of shooting pets.','http://austin.culturemap.com/news/city-life/04-20-14-east-austin-apd-officers-shoot-kill-dog/','Unknown','Two Unknown Police','2','0',2,0,0,2,2,'Uniform',0,2,0,0,2,0),(1000,'2014-06-28','California','Bonita','National City Police Department',1,100,0,'Great Dane 3yo','Deputies are investigating after an off-duty National City police officer shot a dog in Bonita.

Lisa Maclin was hit in the head with a large pellet from a 12-gauge shotgun shell that a Cleveland officer fired at her dog, Dirt, a 3-year-old Rottweiler/Labrador mix, according to the lawsuit filed yesterday. (See lawsuit below in document viewer or here on a mobile device.) The lawsuit names a Lt. Michael Butler as the officer who fired the shots. However, Butler contacted The Plain Dealer Monday and said that is incorrect. Butler, a supervisor in the department&#039;s 5th District, said he was the supervisor on scene, not the officer who fired a weapon. Cleveland police spokeswoman Sgt. Jennifer Ciaccia said an incident did take place but the lawsuit was incorrect in naming Butler. According to the suit, Maclin and her husband, Michael, were walking their two dogs on leashes near E. 140th and Rugby Avenue on Aug. 12, 2012 when Dirt broke free to protect the family&#039;s other dog, Gordo, from an unleashed poodle that was acting aggressively. An officer pulled up in his cruiser and shot three times at Dirt, killing the dog, the suit said. Lisa Maclin, was hit with one of the pellets, which was later removed from her brain at University Hospitals, according to the lawsuit filed in Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court. Attorney Daniel Roth, who represents the Maclins, said the city has hidden information on the incident from the family, including the identity of the officer involved in the shooting. &quot;The city has done everything they could to prevent any information on this coming out,&quot; Roth said. Reached Monday night, Roth said he had to try and find out who the officer was through other channels because the city would not tell him who fired the shotgun or give him any information on the incident. Roth later provided The Plain Dealer with correspondence between his office and city officials dating back to 2012 in which he requested reports on the incident, including the name of the shooter. According to the letters Roth provided, he was told that because the case was open the records were &quot;unobtainable.&quot; Roth said detectives wanted to interview his client but he would not allow it because they city refused to turn over basic information on the shooting. Cleveland Communications Director Maureen Harper declined to comment earlier in the day because the litigation is pending. Cleveland Sgt. Ali Pillow earlier in the day confirmed Butler was a supervisor in the 5th District and said he would forward a reporter&#039;s request for information on the incident and Butler. In an email to The Plain Dealer Butler said he informed the city of the incorrect information in the lawsuit. The lawsuit names Butler, Mayor Frank G. Jackson and former Police Chief Michael McGrath. The suit accuses an officer of using excessive force recklessly in an urban area. Roth said Lisa Maclin has had ongoing medical and psychological issues related to the shooting. He said the pellet removed from her brain was the size of a .32-caliber bullet and was part of one of three shotgun rounds fired at the dog to kill it.

You had already hit her in the chest.&rdquo; A New Jersey State Police trooper and a member of the Mercer County Prosecutor&rsquo;s Office were executing an arrest warrant at 12:30 p.m. Tuesday in an alleyway on the first block of West End Avenue near Derry&rsquo;s home when Poodie appeared, according NJSP Capt. Stephen Jones. &ldquo;This very large dog ran out from behind from a backyard area where there was a fence that wasn&rsquo;t secured,&rdquo; Jones said Wednesday. &ldquo;It ran out of the yard of an abandoned property and charged at the trooper and officer. They both discharged rounds striking the dog and the dog ran away.&rdquo; The officers later found the dog dead in the rear parking lot of Cadwalader Elementary School. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very sad when this type of thing has to happen,&rdquo; Jones said. &ldquo;It unfortunately comes down to protecting life and limb there when you&rsquo;re dealing with a large aggressive animal.&rdquo; But Derry said Poodie was anything but aggressive. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a big baby,&rdquo; said Derry, who just tied the knot last Monday. &ldquo;Of course she&rsquo;s a big dog, but she was a really sweet, humble-type dog. She was very friendly and playful.&rdquo; Derry&rsquo;s husband, Dwayne, said cops came onto the scene with their guns drawn. &ldquo;Why are they going in the back with their guns drawn from the beginning?&rdquo; he questioned. &ldquo;What is your purpose of going in the back of someone&rsquo;s house with your gun drawn?&rdquo; Dwayne Derry said they could have ordered Poodie to stop. &ldquo;She likes to play,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When she sees people, she jumps up wanting to play because she&rsquo;s a playful dog, but shooting her three times was unnecessary.&rdquo;\r\nThe Derrys suggested cops could have pepper-strayed Poodie or shot in the air. &ldquo;They claimed she came at him, but even if that&rsquo;s the case, he could have shot in the air or shot her in the leg,&rdquo; Oweeda Derry said. &ldquo;Why shoot her in her chest and shoot her twice times in the back?&rdquo; Describing proper procedure, Jones explained when a dog is charging, they often move fast. &ldquo;If a situation is occurring and shots are fired within a second, it&rsquo;s not a matter of knowing that you hit a dog and that&rsquo;s the end of it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You got to stop the threat.&rdquo; Jones ruled out other possible uses of force against the animal. The captain said neither officer was carrying a Taser, but it wouldn&rsquo;t have mattered anyway. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s generally not too effective on a charging animal,&rdquo; Jones said. &ldquo;Pepper spray is clearly not effective on most dogs.&rdquo; In the end, Jones said situations like this are a matter of officer safety. &ldquo;If they&rsquo;re there legally serving a warrant on the premises and somebody has a dog that is not controlled, it might be a situation where it&rsquo;s just simply a matter of officer safety,&rdquo; he said.

John Cavazos said he held Pookie in his arms as the dog died. &ldquo;They shot my dog multiple times and left it for dead,&rdquo; Cavazos said. &ldquo;I had to call them back out to euthanize him.&rdquo; Westworth Village police Lt. Glenn Lippertt said that officers responding to a 911 call Thursday found a bulldog mix killing another large dog in the back yard of a home in the 5800 block of Straley Avenue. The officers reported that the bulldog had broken a steel-cable tether and attacked the other dog, which was still tethered, Lippertt said. The officers shot the bulldog twice with a Tazer and twice with beanbag rounds from a shotgun, trying to get it off the other dog, Lippertt said. When that failed, they shot it with a 45-caliber pistol. Cavazos said he was at work when he got a call from his fiance, who told him he needed to come home because his dog had been shot. He said he arrived about 1:30 p.m. to find the bulldog &ldquo;covered in a blanket, kicking and screaming.&rdquo; Cavazos said Pookie was an American bulldog mix and his other dog is a German shepherd mix named Dino. He said the dogs had a habit of getting into fights. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been together for five years and they just get into it every few months,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We just have to hose them down and they separate.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s what Cavazos&rsquo; son, Kameran Jordan, 7, and nephew, Jeremiah Smith, 12, and his father, Johnny Cavazos, were trying to do when the officers arrived. The 911 call that summoned them was made by former Westworth Village Mayor Jim Parnell, who lives next door. Parnell said that he saw Jordan, Smith and the elder Cavazos trying to separate the dogs, and that he even tried spraying water on the dogs himself from the safety of his yard. &ldquo;The pit bull had Dino where he couldn&rsquo;t get loose and was killing him,&rdquo; Parnell said. &ldquo;I knew Dino was going to die, so I called 911.&rdquo; Officers responded within moments, Parnell said, and were communicating with Johnny Cavazos. &ldquo;The police officer was saying, &lsquo;What do you want me to do?&rsquo; &rdquo; Parnell said. &ldquo;The man told the kids to go inside. I saw the officer pull his gun. He told me to get inside, because I was in the line of fire. I got my wife into the house and heard a pop. A little later I heard a pop-pop, and looked outside again. The pit bull was walking around, then he went after Dino again.&rdquo; Lippert said that what happened then was unlike anything he&rsquo;s seen in his 18 years with Westworth Village police. After the Tazer and beanbag rounds failed to make the bulldog release his grip on the other dog&rsquo;s throat, the officers said the older Cavazos asked them to shoot it, Lippert said. &ldquo;One officer shot the pit bull once with a 45-caliber and it broke off from the other dog,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But then it rushed back in and attacked the other dog again. The officer shot the pit bull a second time, and it let go and laid down.&rdquo; About then, Lippert arrived at the scene and saw that the bulldog was down with two gunshots to its body, but not dead. He said that because the bulldog was suffering, he told one of the officers to shoot it again. The officer fired one round into the dog&rsquo;s head, Lippert said, and when the bulldog stopped moving, the officers thought it was dead and left. When Cavazos called Westover police back to the yard, Lippert said he was shocked to see that the bulldog was still breathing. &ldquo;We called Fort Worth Animal Control, and they used four injections before it finally died,&rdquo; he said. Audio recorded by police during the incident confirms everything the officers reported, Lippert said. The two officers involved will not be identified until the reports are released Monday or Tuesday, he said. Cavazos believes none of the police measures were necessary. &ldquo;My son knows how to deal with the dogs and had they not intervened with such disgustingly brutal force my dog would still be alive,&rdquo; Cavazos said. &ldquo;They took matters into their own hands.

It appeared to be unattended and aggressively barking at children as they walked to school. According to investigators, the dog broke from a chain and attacked an adult and child.

Those victims, identified as 44-year-old Michelle Bennett and 14-year-old Alen Velic, were taken to the hospital with bite wounds to their legs.

Some say it was unnecessary force. ABC11 cameras captured the incident at a home on Dunstan Avenue April 12. Officers were looking for Pete Moses and Vania Sisk. According to search warrants, Moses is a suspect in the disappearance of a woman and a 5-year-old boy. Sisk is the boy&#039;s mother. While they&#039;ve not been charged in the disappearances, the SWAT team arrested the pair on other charges at the Dunstan Avenue home after surrounding it the evening of April 12. After the people in the home surrendered, the SWAT team approached to make sure no one else was inside. As ABC11 cameras recorded, the lead officer went up the front steps and then turned and fired at a dog three times - killing it. The dog doesn&#039;t appear to be vicious and doesn&#039;t appear to lunge at officers. In the video, you can see a man sitting on the stoop of a home next door and others standing on the next porch as the three high-powered rounds were fired in their direction. The bystanders were not hurt. Eighteen-year-old Deshawn Porter told ABC11 the dog - a lab named Sheba - was his best friend.\r\n&quot;I didn&#039;t know what to say,&quot; he said. &quot;My neighbor says they shot my dog several times.&quot; Porter said he asked police why the dog was killed. &quot;He said the dog was getting vicious and ready to attack,&quot; said Porter. But that&#039;s not how others saw it. ABC11 asked the Durham Police Department about the incident. It said the officers were making a high-risk entry and the dog appeared to growl and make aggressive moves. We showed the video to Kimberly Alboum, state director for the Humane Society. &quot;That&#039;s devastating,&quot; she said. &quot;Wow, that&#039;s absolutely devastating. That&#039;s just shocking.&quot; Alboum said she sees in the video a SWAT team that needs to be trained in dealing with dogs. &quot;The way it appears on this footage, is that it was just a dog standing up watching them come up on the stairs,&quot; she said. Porter told ABC11 he&#039;s sad, angry, and lonely without Sheba around. Porter said he didn&#039;t witness the shooting because he was among those in the house that night who were detained. He is not charged with any crime. After the standoff, he said police did not apologize and took his dog&#039;s body with them when they left the scene. He doesn&#039;t know what was done with it. ABC11 offered to show Durham police officials the video and to also ask if it was appropriate to discharge an automatic weapon so close to innocent civilians. They declined.

Lazy errors like this are a common feature of Puppycide reporting: When Mary and Rickey Brown heard barking in their yard Monday afternoon, they never imagined they were in danger. That quickly changed when they realized four aggressive dogs were confronting the men painting their house. &ldquo;One of them ran into our house,&rdquo; Mary Brown said. &ldquo;My daughter was frightened and then another dog, a pit bull, ran around back and bit our painter on the arm,&rdquo; she said. The dogs had somehow escaped their home next door, and entered through a hole in the Brown&rsquo;s fence. Mary&rsquo;s husband told her to call 9-1-1. &ldquo;The pit bull was really aggressive, and even foaming at the mouth,&rdquo; he said. Seattle firefighters and paramedics parked their vehicles directly in the driveway of the home where the dogs live. The Browns watched as the paramedics and firefighters were surrounded by the aggressive dogs. &ldquo;They couldn&rsquo;t get to the wounded man because of the dogs,&rdquo; she said. Seattle police officers shot and killed a mixed-pitbull terrier Tuesday after it bit a man in the arm, drawing blood. A dog from the same home bit a Seattle Police Officer last August. Tuesday officers were called to the same home just after 1 p.m. because a man painting a home nearby had been bitten in the arm. When firefighters tried to give the bite victim medical aid the dog and three others barked and lunged, so firefighters called police. The dog, 4-year old Aries, is described as a mixed-breed American Staffordshire terrier which is a type of pit bull. Kim Pace lives with Aries&#039; owner and says something must have provoked him. &quot;It&#039;s their property,&quot; Pace said, &quot;They probably felt threatened and felt like they needed to defend their area. If an animal of any breed feels like they are backed into a corner, they will defend themselves; it has nothing to do with the fact that they are pit bulls.&quot; Witt says officers and firefighters tried many methods to get the loose dogs, described as three pit bulls and one smaller dog, to retreat with no success: &quot;One of the firefighters used a clipboard to throw at the dogs, and he tried to kick them but they continued to advance on the firefighters, and then the officers also used a fire extinguisher, they used pepper spray and none of that worked.&quot; Officers felt threatened enough for one of them to open fire. But neighbors say they have never had any trouble with Aries or any of the other dogs who live with Kim Pace. &quot;I&#039;ve had pit bulls before. I&#039;m very comfortable with them.

The dogs&rsquo; owner also wanted to clarify a claim made by Seattle Police on Tuesday.

Reportedly, the trio of dogs has attacked a man earlier Wednesday morning. Lt. Tracey Ibarra said the man, 37-year-old Andrew Ross of Pasadena, suffered slight puncture wounds to his left leg and scrapes to his knee but declined medical treatment. The dog that was killed was a female pit bull or pit bull mix less than a year old, according to Ricky Whitman, spokesperson for the Pasadena Humane Society and SPCA. Whitman said the dog wasn&rsquo;t spayed and looked like it was in heat. She didn&rsquo;t know yet the breed of the injured dogs. Police identified all three dogs as pit bulls or pit bull mixes. The incident happened shortly after 5 a.m. Wednesday in the 1400 block of Fair Oaks Avenue. Ross was walking his bicycle southbound when the dogs charged him from across the street, according to Ibarra. She said Ross tried to put the bike between himself and dogs that were trying to bite his legs. One bit him. Ross dropped his bicycle and jumped onto the hood of a parked car, Ibarra said. Police found out about the incident when a woman called and said dogs were attacking a man on the sidewalk on Fair Oaks Avenue. &ldquo;The witness reported that the man was being dragged by the dogs, that he was able to break free and take refuge on top of a parked vehicle,&rdquo; Ibarra said.\r\nPolice were told the dogs were still in the area. Two officers found Ross, who was still perched on the car. He pointed out the three dogs north of the vehicle and standing on the sidewalk. Ibarra said it was still dark. The officers used the spotlight on the dogs. The canines trotted south and past Ross. The officers got out of the unit and were now adjacent to the vehicle, Ibarra said. She said the dogs turned around and walked back towards the officers. They were growling and barking as they neared the police, she added. One of the officers fired a shotgun multiple times. &ldquo;The lead dog goes down to the ground,&rdquo; Ibarra said. The two other dogs, which were injured, ran southbound. They were later found and taken by an animal control officer. Ibarra said the dogs had no tags and police don&rsquo;t know who owns the dogs. Ross didn&rsquo;t return a phone call seeking comment. Steve McNall, president and CEO of the Pasadena Humane Society and SPCA, said the two wounded dogs were being treated at an animal emergency center in South Pasadena. A necropsy will be done on the dead dog to find out if it had rabies, he added. McNall said police reached the dogs before an animal control officer, who was in Glendale when the call came in. Councilman Steve Madison, who proposed the mandatory spay/neuter ordinance for pit bull breeds, posted on Facebook about the attack. &ldquo;Pit bulls viciously attacked a cyclist in Pasadena this morning. A witness calling 9-1-1 reported that the dogs were dragging the cyclist down the street. When officers responded the cyclist was up on a car. The pits charged the officers and were shot with a shotgun,&rdquo; Madison wrote. &ldquo;Coincidentally, 36 hours ago my colleagues on the City Council rejected my proposed ordinance that would have called for mandatory spay and neuter of pit bulls. Not a ban, mind you, or even a limit on the number one can own, just spay and neuter to control the overpopulation of this breed. One of my colleagues, Terry Tornek, stated that the &lsquo;evidence&rsquo; did not support the ordinance.&rdquo; When reached by phone, Madison said he wasn&rsquo;t surprised by Wednesday&rsquo;s incident. He has pushed to ban pit bulls in Pasadena for the past two years. Bans on the animals are prohibited by state law, &ldquo;This is going to happen, that was the whole point of my work on this issue over the last couple of years,&rdquo; Madison said. &ldquo;They are just a time bomb. They are killing machines.&rdquo; Madison said he found out about the alleged attack from an e-mail that Police Chief Phillip Sanchez sent to all council members. He said he did not know Ross. Pit bull advocate Josh Liddy of Pasadena said the attack was a problem of circumstance and owner neglect, not breed. He also doubted the identification of the dogs as pit bulls. &ldquo;Just because a police officer claims a dog is a pit bull doesn&rsquo;t mean it is. Even the Humane Society said they don&rsquo;t know how to identify dogs,&rdquo; Liddy said. &ldquo;Even if it was three pit bulls it&rsquo;s still three loose dogs. The breed is irrelevant. You can&rsquo;t demonize every pit bull in Pasadena because three loose dogs attacked a cyclist. It just doesn&rsquo;t make sense.&rdquo; In a statement, Chief Sanchez said it was very fortunate the victim was not badly injured by the attacking dogs. &ldquo;If the animals had been properly secured, this might not have happened. In this instance the officer&rsquo;s quick actions prevented anyone else from being harmed,&rdquo; Sanchez said. The police department isn&rsquo;t conducting a criminal or internal affairs investigation on the shooting. &ldquo;(Due to the) circumstances of the situation, we felt that his actions were not only reasonable but necessary for public safety,&rdquo; Ibarra said. She said the dogs were growling and barking as they approached the officer and had already attacked a man. Any use of force results in a review of department policy and procedure, Ibarra said. A use-of-force report is done which gets reviewed at a later date, she added. At this time, she said the department is not releasing the name of the officer who shot the dog.\r\n&ldquo;There will be an administrative review on the use of force,&rdquo; she said. Under the officer&rsquo;s bill of rights, Ibarra said the officer has the right not to have his name released.','http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/general-news/20140129/pasadena-police-fatally-shoot-pit-bull-after-attack-injure-two-other-dogs','Unknown','Two Unknown Police','1','0',2,0,0,3,3,'Uniform',3,3,0,0,0,0),(1020,'2010-09-22','Maryland','Landover','Prince Georges County Police Department',1,50,0,'Rottweiler mix 4yo','Two men armed with guns attempted to rob a familys house.

While five police held the man down and punched him in the face, a female police officer shot and killed his dog. Neighbors witnessing these events confirmed the dog did not attack anyone and was merely present in the front yard.

Local news described the event as follows: Family members claim they called police for help Wednesday morning, but when officers arrived, they were treated like criminals and an officer shot and killed their family dog. It all unfolded in the 1100 block of Fiji Lane in Landover. Four-year-old Mercedes, a Rottweiler mix, is the latest dog shot and killed by police in Prince George&#039;s County. Dog owner Sterling Barlow said about Mercedes, &quot;Cold blood... Shot in the head for no reason.&quot; The problem started when owner Sterling Barlow&#039;s brother pulled into the family driveway after work early Wednesday morning. The family claims two men immediately approached, armed with a gun and demanding his car. The brother managed to fight them off, ran into the house and came back out firing his gun. &quot;If somebody did that to your family you will retaliate the best way you know how,&quot; said Barlow. After a shootout with the alleged robbers, the two brothers called police. When police arrived, Barlow says things got out of hand with the officers and his innocent dog paid the tragic price. Barlow said, &quot;One grabs me in the head lock and starts punching me in the face.&quot; Mother Dwana Barlow said, &quot;The police officer wouldn&#039;t even let me go to the bathroom... and held me hostage in my own house.&quot; While being wrestled to the ground by five different cops, Barlow and witnesses in the neighborhood tell us a female Prince George&#039;s County officer shot the dog in the head. Barlow stated, &quot;While this was going on I said &#039;please, don&#039;t point a gun at my dog.&#039; I begged her. She didn&#039;t need to be involved in this. She was in the yard.&quot; But Barlow was arrested and charged with multiple crimes, including insulting an officer. Police say the officer acted appropriately when shooting the dog. Neighbor Barbara Wells said, &quot;The dog did not attack anyone. He never approached anyone. Even as the officers grabbed Sterling the dog didn&#039;t do anything.&quot; Police spent hours Wednesday searching for the full police report. Around 10:30 p.m. Wednesday, police called ABC 7 News on the phone and confirmed that an officer did shoot and kill the dog out of self defense.

It&#039;s killing me,&quot; said Michelle Damron, the dog&#039;s owner. &quot;I just think shooting a dog and letting it suffer to its death because you&#039;re too scared to get bit was wrong -- especially when you came in his yard.&quot; Damron said she raised Rocco since he was just three days old. But on Wednesday, the 6-year-old full-sized Doberman found himself caught in the middle of a police pursuit -- right outside his own cage. Police said officers were chasing a home invasion suspect through Damron&#039;s neighborhood on Madelon Court around 6 p.m. when the suspect darted into her back yard. &quot;I got up to see what was going on because the dog was raising a fit, just barking, and I saw somebody else come as I was getting to the door, and as soon as I opened the door, I heard two gunshots,&quot; Damron said. &quot;I looked over and my dog was hollering and there was blood everywhere, and he went inside of his dog house and eventually died.&quot; &quot;He went back in there crying and screaming and eventually died. He suffered,&quot; Damron continued. &quot;They were chasing an armed robber and I guess he feared he was going to get bit. That dog wouldn&#039;t have bit.&quot; Police said the Doberman jumped on the suspect and then attacked an officer. They said the officer had to shoot the dog in self-defense and to protect the suspect. Still, Damron is unconvinced. &quot;It did not give them the right to shoot my dog. I mean, a dog is going to bark. That&#039;s his job. He&#039;s in his yard. You come in his yard, he&#039;s going to bark,&quot; Damron said. Metro Animal Services came to remove the dog from the scene. Damron said she wants more. &quot;I think something ought to be done other than an apology. An apology doesn&#039;t stop his hurt. It doesn&#039;t stop my hurt. It doesn&#039;t bring back my dog,&quot; Damron said. Police are calling it a horrible situation. But they said that doesn&#039;t change the fact that police officers have the right to defend themselves when they&#039;re being attacked, whether by a human or by an animal. Police said the department is working with the dog&#039;s owner and her family to help with the situation. Police said the home invasion suspect was Dijon Barlow, 24. He was handcuffed and taken into custody shortly after the dog was shot. He&#039;s being charged with fleeing or evading police, resisting arrest and third-degree criminal trespass. Apparently the polices attempts to work with Ms Damron failed, because she and her son Austin Pike sued the officer responsible for the killing, Joseph Pence. The lawsuit was filed in April of 2012 in Jefferson County Circuit Court, case number 12-CI-001942 PIKE, AUSTIN, A MINOR,  ET AL VS. PENCE, JOSEPH. This is not the first time that Joseph Pence has had and outburst of extreme violence and used his badge to avoid the consequences. A grand jury indicted Pence on charges of wanton endangerment, official misconduct and driving under the influence. Pence was off duty and driving a car with a woman named Veronica Zeigler in the passenger seat. Both Pence and Zeigler testified that Pence followed a group of men to an apartment complex after one of the men threw something at his blue Mazda and cursed at a stoplight on Bardstown Road in the Hikes Point area where the men surrounded the car and punched the officer through his window. But Sgt. Rick Polin, who investigated the incident, told the grand jury on Feb. 20 that Pence and Zeigler initially lied to police, saying Zeigler was driving. Instead, Polin said, Pence was intoxicated and, according to witnesses, drove his car at the men, intentionally striking Jason Taylor, rolling him onto the hood and into the windshield. The grand jury believed Polin, and indicted.','http://www.wlky.com/Police-Shoot-Kill-Dog-During-Foot-Chase/9793390','Rocco','Joseph Pence','1','0',2,0,0,0,0,'Uniform',0,2,0,0,1,0),(1025,'2012-11-02','Florida','Fort Lauderdale','Fort Lauderdale Police Department',1,2,1,'Unconfirmed 4 yo Dog','The owners of a pit bull who was shot by an officer in Fort Lauderdale after police said it attacked a K-9 Friday morning said they think the killing could have been avoided. The incident happened in the 1500 block of Northwest 24th Avenue, when officers responded to an in-progress burglary at a nearby business, Fort Lauderdale Police spokeswoman Det. DeAnna Garcia said. When the officers arrived, the suspects fled into the yard where the dog was, Garcia said. The officers were trying to catch the suspects when the dog attacked the K-9. An officer tried several times to free the K-9 from the other dog but it didn&#039;t work, Garcia said. &quot;The officer, who was in fear for his and his K-9 partner&rsquo;s safety, used lethal force to free his K-9 partner from the other dog&rsquo;s mouth,&quot; Garcia said in a statement. She didn&#039;t say whether any suspects were taken into custody. Antonio Spann, the pit bull&#039;s owner, said he had warned police about the dog and told them not to open the fence, which was chained and had a sign reading &quot;Beware of The Dog.&quot; &quot;I hear one shot. &#039;Boom.&#039; Then two shots, &#039;boom, boom&#039;,&quot; Spann said. &quot;That means he was shot again when he already down.&quot; Spann&#039;s father, Anthony Sinkfield, said he tried to stop the officers. &quot;When they opened the gate, the dog rushed out and the officer ran out and before I could get outside to tell the dogs to go back, they shot and killed my dog,&quot; Sinkfield said.\r\nSinkfield said he&#039;d had the pit bull, a 4-year-old named U-law, since he was a puppy. &quot;We raised them since they were puppies, they were like part of the family,&quot; he said. Spann said to make matters worse, officers just left the dog laying on the ground. &quot;They left my dog there all night long, you&#039;re talking about cruelty to animals,&quot; Spann said. &quot;They didn&#039;t do anything, they just left my dog on the ground and left, didn&#039;t say anything to us, picked up the shell casings and just left,&quot; Sinkfield said. A police department spokesperson said officers on scene offered to help with the removal of the animal, but the owner would not allow it. Garcia said the K-9 was taken to an animal hospital and treated for wounds sustained in the attack. Spann said he spent the early morning burying the dog before his children woke up. &quot;Of course I&#039;m upset...he was doing his job, to protect the property,&quot; Spann said.','http://www.nbcmiami.com/news/Pit-Bull-Owners-Upset-After-Police-Shoot-Dog-in-Fort-Lauderdale-176963501.html','U-law','Unknown','0','0',2,0,0,0,0,'Uniform',0,1,2,2,2,2),(1026,'2014-01-13','Ohio','Lorain','Lorain Police Department',2,2,1,'Labrador and Unconfirmed','A pit bull attacked a 6-year-old boy just before 4 p.m. Monday outside a home at 675 W. 13th St. Lorain Police Sgt. Marty Carreon said the pit bull came out of a house at 688 W. 13th St. and attacked the boy &mdash; whom the Morning Journal is not naming at this time &mdash; who was playing across the street with a group of children. The boy&rsquo;s family members ran out of the house to pull the pit bull off of the boy when the family&rsquo;s black Labrador retriever began fighting with the pit bull, Carreon said. &ldquo;Once the black dog was tazed, it started to walk back up the porch to the house when the other followed,&rdquo; Carreon recalled. As the family tried to save the boy, neighbors also ran into the street to assist, he said. &ldquo;It was chaotic for a while,&rdquo; Carreon said. When police arrived on scene, they used a Taser on both dogs before an officer shot the pit bull to death. Carreon said police used the Taser on the pit bull four times before they had to shoot it. The boy&rsquo;s aunt, Kristen Tucker, 27, said her nephew suffered a gash on his leg. She said the pit bull had her nephew by the leg when she and other relatives ran to pull the dog off. &ldquo;We thought he was going to go for his throat,&rdquo; the boy&rsquo;s grandmother, Liz Ellis, said. &ldquo;I started hollering we needed help because they weren&rsquo;t getting their dog off the kid.&rdquo; Two neighbor girls also ran to the porch to help the boy, Ellis said. One girl took a chair and hit the pit bull, she said. Ellis said she&rsquo;s seen the pit bull tied up in the neighbor&rsquo;s yard at 688 W. 13th St., but the neighbor is denying ownership of the dog. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve got a dog and you know it bites, you&rsquo;ve got to keep it locked down,&rdquo; Ellis said. When the alleged owner of the pit bull attempted to intervene, the man suffered a hand injury. Lorain Police Capt. Roger Watkins said the man &ldquo;may or may not lose his finger.&rdquo; LifeCare put the boy on a stretcher before transporting him to the hospital. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s gashed up,&rdquo; Ellis said. &ldquo;His leg is wide open.&rdquo; The Labrador retriever retreated into the house with the family, who has lived on West 13th Street for less than four months. Tucker said she was relieved the Labrador retriever wasn&rsquo;t shot, too. &ldquo;My dog&rsquo;s like my kid,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got a Taser stuck in his back and a tear on his head.

He can&#039;t understand why an officer shot the dog dead. Cooke&#039;s yellow Labrador retriever Callaway was shot once in the head by officer Mark Morales near the back door to Cooke&#039;s house about 4:30 p.m. Saturday. Cooke said he was away at Mass when his burglar alarm went off. Officers responded and started to check the back door to see if anyone had broken in. The dog ran at Morales in a &quot;full aggressive charge,&quot; the officer wrote in a preliminary report, and posed an &quot;imminent threat of physical harm.&quot; Cooke, a dentist, noted that Morales was not bitten or scratched by the dog. He said Morales should have either kicked the dog away or used his Taser or pepper spray. &quot;He could have done any number of things, other than shoot the dog,&quot; Cooke said. &quot;I don&#039;t think any family should have to endure this.&quot; Police took Callaway, named after the golf equipment, to the West Park Animal Hospital and notified Cooke and his family. Cooke said he agreed to euthanize the dog. News of the shooting made its way through animal rights e-mail lists Sunday and Monday. Most of those e-mails did not mention the dog charging the officer, only that it barked. By late Monday, police and Westlake Mayor Dennis Clough received several calls and e-mails angry over the shooting. &quot;I am mortified,&quot; wrote resident Linda Stacks. Resident and dog owner Jessica Monnolly called the shooting &quot;shocking&quot; in an e-mail. &quot;I am rightly concerned about my own dog&#039;s well-being should something like this (house alarm, etc.) happen at my home,&quot; she wrote. &quot;What are the regulations that protect us and our dogs from the same fate!?&quot; The Animal Protective League in Cleveland plans to review the incident, said director Sharon Harvey. The group needs to know more facts before reaching any conclusions, she said. Clough cannot remember any previous incidents of officers shooting pets at homes in his more than 20 years as mayor. He said he would wait for a full report before making further comment. &quot;We&#039;re sorry about the dog being shot,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#039;s an unfortunate incident at this point.&quot; Police spokesman Ray Arcuri said officers do not believe any neighbors were home at the time of the shooting and urged any witnesses to come forward. He said supervisors will talk with Morales, but the standards for how police respond to the shooting of an animal differ from the shooting of a person. Morales has been on the force four years and has never fired his gun on duty before. He will continue working during the investigation, Arcuri said. Police and Cooke agree on the events that brought police to the house: Cooke said he keeps his two retrievers in his garage while away from the house and that the dogs probably pushed open the garage&#039;s back door, setting off the alarm. A third dog belonging to his daughter was also there.\r\nArcuri said the home has had four false alarms since the start of December and had a few earlier last year. Cooke said the dogs would naturally bark and approach officers and bark or growl since the officers are strangers on the dogs&#039; territory. But he insists the dogs do not bite and pose no real threat. Arcuri said one dog trotted toward Morales barking but Callaway ran past the other at the officer. Morales backed away and yelled at Callaway to stop, but he did not. The dog was shot three to four feet from where the officer was standing. &quot;He didn&#039;t have the option to go to things less than lethal,&quot; Arcuri said. Cooke said Morales could have taken shelter behind yard furniture near the door or gone around a fence. In the calls and e-mails to the city, others questioned training they said should have had the officer better prepared. U.S. Postal Service carriers deal with dogs on their routes all the time, but carry only pepper spray, said spokesman Victor Dubina. But in coming through the same areas regularly, they learn the dogs and behaviors and know which ones to watch out for. Even so, 18 carriers were bitten last year in the Greater Cleveland area, which includes most of Cuyahoga County. Another seven were injured evading dogs.','http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2010/03/owner_animal_advocates_questio.html','Callaway','Mark Morales','1','0',0,0,0,0,0,'Uniform',1,2,0,0,2,0),(1028,'2011-01-12','Washington','Seattle','Seattle Police Department West Precinct',2,2,0,'Unconfirmed','A Seattle police officer responding to a report of domestic violence shot a dog Wednesday in West Seattle.

Moses&rsquo; 7-month-old Akita dog, Diva, was shot 13 times and killed April 5 during police pursuit of juveniles who&rsquo;d been driving down South Side streets and shooting. But Youngstown&rsquo;s police chief says the situation called for a quick decision to protect police officers. The driver of the 1998 Pontiac had fled from police, and pulled into a front yard on Lucius Avenue. There, officers chased the five suspects on foot, a police report states. One of the five was followed into the East Lucius Avenue home of Moses and Darcel Gilmore. Officers were met inside the house by the couple&rsquo;s 42-pound dog. The teenager ran down the basement stairs to hide. When officers opened the basement door from the kitchen, &ldquo;the dog approached Officer [Ryan] Laatsch in an aggressive manner,&rdquo; the police report states. There were three officers in the house. &ldquo;Officer Laatsch, who already had service weapon drawn due to the circumstances of the situation, shot approximately five to six times striking the dog ... then shot the dog approximately five to six more times ...then shot the dog one more time directly in the top of his head from only a few inches away,&rdquo; the report stated. &ldquo;I know you have to do your job, but they overdid it,&rdquo; said Moses, who has no relationship to the teenager who ran into the house. One of the other juveniles was Gilmore&rsquo;s son, but does not live at the East Lucius Avenue residence, Moses said. When the basement door was opened, Diva had been trained to come upstairs to be let outside. The dog never had any problems with the neighbors nor any history of aggressiveness, he said. &ldquo;She was still a puppy &mdash; still playful,&rdquo; Moses said. &ldquo;If she was so vicious, why wouldn&rsquo;t she attack the stranger who ran into the basement?&rdquo; he asked. Akitas can weigh about 100 pounds when fully grown. Dave Nelson, Mahoning County deputy dog warden, said they are generally a breed to use caution around. Akitas are generally protective of their family and property, he said. Police Chief Jimmy Hughes said officers had few options. &ldquo;For the most part, the [situation] came about in fast succession, within close quarters and the officers had little place to go,&rdquo; Hughes said. The kitchen where the dog was shot is about 7 feet by 15 feet, Moses estimated. &ldquo;The dog was coming after the officer and he was in fear for his life and the lives of the other officers,&rdquo; Hughes said. Officers are taught to use force when necessary and Laatsch didn&rsquo;t have much room or time to defend himself, he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s unfortunate that it was as many rounds as it was, but he fired until the dog ceased to attack,&rdquo; Hughes said. The suspect hiding in the basement was arrested on obstructing official business charges. Officers found a box of live ammunition, as well as a scale and a bag of suspected cocaine near the suspect&rsquo;s hiding place, the report states. The items were collected as evidence, but no one is charged in connection with the items. Moses and Gilmore said their dog and home were innocent bystanders to the episode that left their dog dead and kitchen with seven bullet holes in the floor, as well damage to their walls and refrigerator.\r\n&ldquo;That was a daughter,&rdquo; Gilmore said of Diva. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m messed up; we raised her since she was 5 weeks old,&rdquo; Moses added. Officers should have used a different kind of force, such as pepper spray, the couple said. &ldquo;It was just a senseless killing,&rdquo; Moses said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if restitution is in order at this time&rdquo; for the dog and house owners, Hughes said. Taser guns may have been an alternative to shooting the animal, but officers aren&rsquo;t equipped with that kind of weapon, he said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t encourage officers to shoot their guns unless it&rsquo;s a life-threatening situation,&rdquo; Hughes said. &ldquo;In this case, they felt it was life-threatening.&rdquo;','http://www.vindy.com/news/2009/apr/14/youngstown-police-shoot-8216aggressive8217/','Diva','Ryan Laatsch and Two Unknown Police','2','0',1,0,0,0,0,'Uniform',0,0,2,2,2,2),(1030,'2013-09-23','Arizona','Kingman','Kingman Police Department',1,50,0,'German Shepherd','Police shot a dog while it was restrained on a choke pole.

Market Street, he came across a man who was walking his dog and had no identification, gave two dates for his birth and no address. McCauley requested a warrant check on the man, who gave the name Isreal Rosario, 46 or 47, and was told first there were no warrants for Rosario, then that the state Probation Office issued a warrant for possession with the intent to deliver drugs. McCauley said he had already let Rosario go, but called after him to secure his dog, drop a duffle bag he was carrying and approach the officer to be arrested.

Responding to complaints of loud music, three Burbank police officers arrived at the hilltop home of Avis Gyandzhyan, in the 2500 block of East Elmwood Avenue, just as the combination Halloween-birthday party was ending and people were gathered on the front lawn saying their good nights around 11 p.m. Wednesday. Max, the family&#039;s beloved boxer, who was dressed in a cowboy costume for the party, barked and ran out to the entrance of the courtyard on the Gyandzhyan property to greet the officers, one of whom then removed his gun from his holster and shot the dog in the head with one bullet, said Alisa Abelian, one of the dog&#039;s owners. &quot;Instead of saying, &#039;Please, hold your dog,&#039; he just takes out his gun and shoots him in the head, not in the leg, in the head,&quot; said Abelian, 27, who had helped raise Max since he was a puppy.

After being shot, the dog ran away from police and has yet to be found. Animal control officers were called to the 4400 block of Anderson Ave. on Tuesday night by residents who were concerned about dogs running loose in the neighborhood, according to Suffolk spokeswoman Debbie George. When they arrived, the animal control officers were trapped in their vehicle by two dogs, a boxer and a black Labrador, which charged the vehicle every time officers attempted to leave the vehicle, she said. They soon called for police backup. When police officers arrived on the scene, George said both animals &ldquo;acted in an aggressive manner&rdquo; to the officers. The police officers attempted to use their tasers on the dogs, but they were unsuccessful. The dogs still kept charging at the officers, until officers shot at them, George said on Tuesday. The boxer ran away and was not found until late Wednesday morning. After being shot at the first time, the Labrador retriever, according to George, charged again at the officers. The officers than shot again at the dog, this time hitting the animal, which ran away to the nearby woods, limping. Police officers and animal control officers could not find the dog Tuesday. As of press time Wednesday, the dog has not been found. The owners of the boxer was charged with allowing a dog to run at large. The owner of the missing lab, Tiffanie Garner, also was charged with allowing a dog to run at large, along with not having a city license for the animal, according to George. George added that the officers acted well within their rights to shoot at the dogs. &ldquo;Officers do have the authority to euthanize an animal if they feel it is a danger to someone else or the officers themselves,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Every situation is handled on a case-by-case basis.

Paula Rodecap said Friday afternoon she had been told by a Topeka animal control officer that the dog would recover from its wounds. But she is angry that officials won&rsquo;t tell her where the dog is being held after being treated by a local veterinarian, and even angrier that she can&rsquo;t retrieve the animal until appearing in municipal court to answer charges related to maintaining a dangerous dog. The incident was reported around 1:30 a.m. Friday in an alley behind a residence at 1532 S.W. Central Park as two police officers were responding to a call. Police Lt. Chuck Haggard said a dog &ldquo;charged&rdquo; toward one of the officers from the backyard of a residence. The officer responded by shooting the dog. Rodecap, 44, said the staffordshire pit bull terrier named Jackson Smore suffered at least one gunshot wound to his right hind-quarter. She said Jackson Smore is a registered companion dog to her husband, Rick Rodecap, 56, who is disabled, and that his personal care attendant had let the dog out the back door to relieve itself around 1:30 a.m. Friday. She said the dog encountered a pair of Topeka police officers who she said were doing &ldquo;foot patrol&rdquo; in the alley. She was inside her home watching television, she said, when she heard gunfire behind her house. She said police told her the dog was shot after it charged at them. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt the dog came at the officers,&rdquo; Rodecap said, &ldquo;but not in an aggressive manner.&rdquo; Rodecap said her backyard doesn&rsquo;t have a fence and the dog wasn&rsquo;t on a cable because it was only outside for a few minutes to go to the bathroom. She said her pit bull wasn&rsquo;t aggressive and that it was known as a friendly animal to residents of the Central Park neighborhood and at her former residence, Knightsbridge Manor, 501 S.W. Franklin, where she and her husband formerly lived. She said she found four spent shell casings in her backyard and questioned why officers had to shoot the dog, which she believes was moving away from officers when it was wounded. After the dog was shot, Rodecap said, it came back inside her residence where he &ldquo;bled all over the place.&rdquo; Bloodstains could be seen behind her home and inside her kitchen, living room, staircase and upstairs. Rodecap said she called for the police shift supervisor to come to her house after the incident because she was so upset. She said the supervisor did come to her home. However, she said, some officers at her residence left shortly before 2 a.m. to respond to a shooting in the 600 block of S.W. Tyler that turned out to be the city&rsquo;s fourth homicide of the year.

Cops were called when the dogs couldn&#039;t be separated, and when they arrived, witnesses were stunned at the reaction. One officer shot at the dogs five times with a pistol, then another fired one blast from a shotgun. Both dogs were killed. And this all went down right in front of Chester High School. Tehran Freeman, a dog owner himself who lives down the block from the shooting, captured the incident on video with his cell phone and was outraged at the handling of the situation. &quot;I don&#039;t care how bad they try to make Chester seem, this is not a war zone, you don&#039;t do things like that,&quot; he told NBCPhiladelphia.com. &quot;I thought them as the police should be held to a higher standard and would have some type of procedure for breaking it up than actually pulling out your pistols in front of the high school.&quot; Freeman told NBCNews.com that the bigger, more aggressive dog seemed to be a pit bull and had a leash, but the other smaller dog didn&#039;t. It was unclear who the owners were. He said when he saw the police the &quot;last thing that I thought would happen&quot; is that they would open fire with their guns. &quot;It wasn&#039;t secure at all, I know bullets can ricochet and anything else -- you&#039;re trying to shoot two animals in the back of a metal vehicle, that bullet can go anywhere.&quot; Chester police told NBCPhiladelphia.com that the incident was under investigation and at the time the animal control officer in the city was unavailable.

According to the department, officers responded to the apartment complex on the 2900 block of College Avenue at approximately 6:07 p.m. on July 3 for an incident not related to the dog or its owners. Once there, the officers encountered the dog, which was said to be barking and growling at the officers, according to Public Information Officer Emily Hejna. Officers requested that the dog be taken inside more than once, Hejna said. The dogs owner, Antoinette Skelton, said she attempted to take the dog into her apartment but the dog got loose as she grappled with it while also holding her four-year-old son. When the dog ran at the officer he feared he would be attacked, Hejna said, prompting him to fire his weapon. We always try to work with the owners or responsible person, whoever is in charge of the dog, to restrain the dog properly so we dont have to shoot it. But if it continues to be aggressive even after that and its clear that it cannot be restrained before somebody is bitten, officers are trained to fire their weapon to eliminate the threat to themselves, other officers, citizens, whomever, Hejna said. We have a responsibility to protect people. Yes, we also have a responsibility to protect animals, but our first priority (is) the human lives in our city. And thats their welfare as well as their life. Skelton and the dogs other owner, Devin Scott, believe their dog was a victim of profiling. Its a discussion that has come into the public forum in recent years  nature versus nurture in regards to pit bulls and their interactions with humans and other animals. Scott said his dog, which the family had named Baby Girl, wasnt the kind of dog that gives pit bulls their bad name. I know for a fact its not even assuming  that he definitely treated her as if she was just an alley dog, as just a pit bull that would just be running around in some neighborhood or something, Scott asserted. Skelton was also upset that the incident happened in front of her son, who suffers from autism. She said her son cant sleep at night since the incident. She feels both of their lives were put in danger. My son was outside on my hip on the front porch, where any bullet could have ricocheted. It could have hit him, it could have hit me, Skelton said. Hejna said that while the incident was unfortunate, the officer did what he had to do given the situation. Had that person restrained their dog as the officers had requested multiple times prior to having to shoot it, we never would have been in this situation, Hejna said. She tried  she put it inside but it got out again as she was exiting the building, and so the officer had no choice at that point. The family also questioned the use of a firearm as opposed to less serious means of defusing the situation. Hejna said the pepper spray used by police to disarm individuals actually serves to make dogs angrier, and Tasers are designed for a human body, so the trajectory of the prongs would likely miss a dog. In incidents like this, Hejna said an official report is written and reviewed by the officers supervisor. When a firearm is discharged, the chief of police also reviews the report. She said most officers are dog lovers and try their hardest to avoid situations such as this. Most of us down here love animals and want to protect animals, but we first and foremost have to protect people, Hejna said. Skeltons mother, Shinnette Davis, said no amount of justification will ease the pain of losing the familys pet for the past nine years. She was a good, good dog, Davis said. She was a part of our family.

The incident started when police tried to pull over a vehicle for trying to run another vehicle off the road shortly after 11 p.m. Thursday, according to a news release from Lake City Police Department. Police say a 26-year-old man called 911 Thursday night to report a truck was driving recklessly behind him and trying to run him off the road. When police got to the intersection of U.S. 90 and S.W. Baya  Drive, they allegedly watched as both vehicles drove by and noted that the truck did not have its headlights on. Officers tried to pull the truck being driven by 47-year-old Timothy Schultz over, but Schultz reportedly did not stop for police. Schultz drove the speed limit as officers pursued, but he kept slamming on his brakes for an unknown reason. He continued driving until he reached his home in the 500 block of N.E. Jacksonville Loop where police saw him drive into his yard. Once out of his truck, Schultz stood and stared at the officers, before being ordered to get onto the ground several times. At that point Schultz reportedly opened the door to the back seat of his truck, releasing his dog, a German Shepherd. Once out of the truck, the dog ran aggressively toward police.\r\nOne of the officers then shot the dog, which then ran from the area. Officers then turned their attention back to dealing with Schultz, who was still not obeying officers&#039; commands. Police used a Taser on Schultz, but there was no effect. In fact, officers said Schultz even tried to remove the prongs from the Taser. A second officer used his Taser on Schultz, this time causing him to fall to the ground. As police attempted to handcuff Schultz, he allegedly continued to fight with officers until they finally subdued him. Officers contacted the animal shelter to treat the wounded German Shepherd. Schultz&#039;s injuries were treated by paramedics with Lifeguard EMS.\r\nSchultz was arrested and taken to the Columbia County Jail. While at the jail, corrections officers tried to get Schultz to give relevant samples, since police suspected him of DUI.  Schultz refused the test, resulting in his driver&#039;s license being automatically suspended for 12 months due to his refusal. As the investigation continued, police learned that Schultz&#039;s German Shepherd was receiving training to become a &quot;personal protection&quot; K-9 at Von Seestadt Kennels located in Lake City.

Rubino said the officers&#039; appear to have been justified in shooting the dog. &quot;Based on a preliminary review, the officers&rsquo; actions appear to have been an appropriate response to the threat posed,&quot; Rubino said.

Note how in the lied the report claims that both dogs killed were pit bulls, while later the same article claims that one dog was a german shepherd and the other a pit bull mix: The city of Minneapolis has settled a lawsuit stemming from an incident two years ago in which city cops shot two pit bulls &mdash; one of which was so close to 3-year-old girl it splattered blood on her pajamas &mdash; in a North Minneapolis home. The City Council agreed to pay James and Aisha Keten $225,000 on March 29, a few weeks after U.S. District Judge Donovan Frank wrote that he would not dismiss several counts of a complaint filed in 2011. Most notably, Frank wrote that a reasonable juror could conclude that a Minneapolis police officer acted unreasonably when he fired multiple shots into small kitchen with a young girl nearby. According to court documents: Officers on April 13 were conducting a search warrant, looking for an assault rifle they believed was used by James Keten&rsquo;s brother Lamont to shoot a woman eight days earlier. Officers were warned that four potentially aggressive pit bulls were in the home, and also that children would be present. First, one officer shot a 60-pound pit bill mix named Kano. The officer testified that the dog charged him. Keten alleges that officers hand-tied him and beat him, but a hospital could find no bruises or injuries to Keten. Another officer, Chad Fuchs, went into the kitchen where the couple&rsquo;s 3-year-old daughter was eating breakfast. The Kenten&rsquo;s allege that Fuchs fired several shots close to the girl, including ones that killed a 40-pound pit bull-German Shepard mix named Remy. Remy was sitting near the feet of the girl. Remy&rsquo;s blood splattered on the girl&rsquo;s pajamas, and the girl has since been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. She regularly sees the therapist. Aisha Keten attempted to rush into the kitchen to grab her daughter, but police restrained her in the bathroom, where she had been getting ready for work. Fuchs claims the dog was threatening, but the girl and Aisha Keten say the dog did not bark or growl. The family also says officers damaged several of their belongings. The gun was not found in the home, and Aisha and James were not arrested. City Attorney Susan Segal has not responded to request for comment this morning on possible punishment for any of the officers. The lawsuit identification information is as follows: Keten et al v.

The dog was killed Feb. 11 by a deputy who had gone to a residence in the 300 block of 20th Street East in Palmetto looking for 20-year-old Raphael J. Houston, who was wanted on grand theft and burglary charges. When a 13-year-old girl let the dog out a side door, a deputy looking for Houston shot and killed the dog. Now the family, who has retained an attorney, is considering a lawsuit. Tiffany Summerall, 13, who resides at the residence with her parents, Raphael O. Houston and Christina Summerall, and five younger siblings, said she let the family dog out not knowing deputies were in her yard. Brooklyn, a 6-year-old brown and white dog, normally was let out at the time the deputies were at the residence, according to family members. Tiffany heard a man&rsquo;s voice telling her to come and get the dog. &ldquo;I called the dog three times and then walked over,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;(The deputy) was swinging a walkie talkie at the dog. He then pulled out a gun. I said, &lsquo;Please don&rsquo;t shoot him. He&rsquo;s not going to bite.&rsquo;&rdquo; Tiffany called the dog one last time and the dog started to walk toward her, she said. &ldquo;He started walking toward me and he shot him,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I started screaming, &lsquo;Why did you shoot my dog?&rsquo;&rdquo; According to a sheriff&rsquo;s office internal affairs report, the deputy told investigators, &ldquo;The dog was barking and/or growling and bearing it&rsquo;s (sic) teeth. I began back peddling (sic) and the dog continued charging toward me and lunged toward me with its front legs leaving the ground. I swung my radio at the dog in an attempt to avoid being bitten.&rdquo; The sheriff&rsquo;s office classified the dog as a pit bull in reports, while the family said the dog was not a pit bull, but rather a mixed breed. The deputy told investigators Brooklyn lunged at him a several times before he fired. The dog sustained a gunshot wound to its right side and later died. Sheriff&rsquo;s office policy allows deputies to shoot dogs if they fear for their personal safety or the safety of others. The deputy was exonerated, according to the internal affairs report. &ldquo;Due to the fact the dog was aggressively pursuing (the deputy) with the apparent intention of inflicting physical harm, coupled with the fact that no one in the residence had any control over the animal whatsoever, (he) was only left with the options of being attacked by the dog or resorting to lethal force to terminate the attack,&rdquo; the reports states. Raphael J. Houston was not arrested, but he was picked up the next day.\r\nHouston&rsquo;s father lives at the residence, but Houston hasn&rsquo;t lived there in almost five years, according to family members. According to the sheriff&rsquo;s office, when deputies go to pick up people on warrants, they usually check the person&rsquo;s driver&rsquo;s license and latest arrest report and talk with their probation officer to determine their whereabouts. They look up relatives and known associates. Sometimes, they do surveillance on properties before making contact, according to authorities. According to the internal affairs report on the shooting, authorities relied upon the address on Raphael J. Houston&rsquo;s driver&rsquo;s license. &ldquo;His relatives live there. We had every reason to believe he might be there,&rdquo; said sheriff&rsquo;s spokesman Dave Bristow. Bristow said the family never filed a complaint with the sheriff&rsquo;s office\r\nHouston said his son was recently in jail. Had authorities checked with a probation officer or arrest reports, they would have had the correct address, he said &ldquo;If they had investigated, my dog would be alive today,&rdquo; Raphael O. Houston said. &ldquo;I would love to do whatever is necessary for justice even though it can&rsquo;t bring my dog back.&rdquo; Mark Lipinski, who is representing the family, said a letter will be sent to the sheriff&rsquo;s office this week requesting a meeting. He said the dog had no prior complaints with Manatee County Animal Services. &ldquo;The fact of the matter is he overreacted. He didn&rsquo;t do what he should have done which is retreat,&rdquo; Lipinski said. &ldquo;As a result, we have a family that isn&rsquo;t complete.&rdquo; This incident is one of three dog-related shootings this year with deputies at the sheriff&rsquo;s office.','http://www.bradenton.com/2010/03/22/2147192_family-seeks-answers-in-dogs-death.html?rh=1','Brooklyn','Unknown','2','0',1,0,0,2,2,'Uniform',2,2,2,2,2,0),(1059,'2014-06-05','New Jersey','Beverly','Beverly Police Department, Edgewater Park Police Department and Delanco Police Department ',1,50,0,'German Shepherd','A former city councilman was charged with disorderly conduct and obstruction earlier this month in connection with an incident involving a loose dog that was eventually shot by a police officer. Luis Crespo, 54, is scheduled to appear in Mansfield Municipal Court on Thursday for a hearing on the charges, which stem from a June 5 case involving a 1 year old German shepherd named Thor that ran off after a freak accident in which a woman’s finger was amputated after it got caught in the dog’s harness. The dogs owner, Thomas Lockhart, said his fiancée, Patricia Adams, was walking the dog down stairs when a ring on her pinkie got caught in its harness. The finger was cut off when the dog pulled away from her. It took half her finger off, Lockhart said in an interview, adding that the dog did bite Adams other hand as she tried to free herself. Responding police from Beverly and Edgewater Park believed the dog had bitten Adams finger off, and the animal was shot after it allegedly approached the officers in an aggressive manner in a vacant lot off Perkins Lane. The dog was shot three times in the neck and chest, but survived after being treated at a veterinary hospital. The dog was returned to Lockhart on Thursday after being quarantined at the Burlington County Animal Shelter in Westampton. A follow up investigation with doctors confirmed that Adams injury was not consistent with a dog bite, and was more consistent with having the finger separated via pulling action, Public Safety Director Richard Wolbert said. Crespo was at the scene of the shooting and was charged with obstruction and disorderly conduct for allegedly failing to follow officers directions to stay away from the dog, Wolbert said. Crespo is also accused of ignoring officers instructions by chasing the dog after it was shot and of allegedly trying to grab the snare of an animal control officer after she arrived on the scene, he said. The case has been assigned to Mansfields municipal court because Crespo is a former member of the City Council. He served for about seven years, but was defeated first in the Democratic primary in June 2012 and later in the 2013 general election after he was reappointed to fill an unexpired term. Reached Friday, Crespo said he would contest the charges. He denied trying to take the animal control officers snare, and said he complied with officers instructions as soon as it was safe for him to do so. Crespo said he became involved in the incident after seeing the dog run loose along Warren Street. He said he initially believed the dog belonged to a friend, but he followed it into the vacant lot because he was worried it might injure a bystander. Crespo said the dog acted petrified in the lot, began growling and snarling at him when he approached, and moved toward him when he tried to back away. He said officers from Beverly and Edgewater Park arrived and came from behind him with their service weapons drawn. They yelled for me to get behind them, but the dog wouldnt let me move. He was growling and snarling and clearly petrified, Crespo said. I didnt feel safe moving. I didnt want to turn my back on him, because I was afraid Id get mauled. He said he was eventually able to retreat behind an Edgewater Park officer, who then shot the dog. I didnt interfere with officers. The only order I was given was to get behind them, Crespo said, adding that he did chase the dog after it was shot because he was afraid it might attack another bystander. Crespo said that he did not believe the animal needed to be shot and that he did not see it charge aggressively at any officers. I heard the officer say, If the dog comes any closer, Im taking it down. Then they shot it in the field, he said. Wolbert has said the shooting is under investigation. The identity of the officer who shot the dog has not been released. Crespo is no stranger to controversy in this small riverfront town. He was previously named in a sexual harassment lawsuit filed by a former female police officer and another female employee. The city paid a $200,000 settlement to the officer last year and a $75,000 settlement to the other employee in 2012. In April 2010, police responded to a bomb scare involving Crespos truck, but an investigation revealed there was no evidence that a third party was involved. In a letter obtained by the Burlington County Times, an assistant prosecutor with the Burlington County Prosecutors Office said there was evidence to suggest Crespo may have attached an inoperable device to his own truck for unknown reasons.','http://www.burlingtoncountytimes.com/news/local/former-beverly-councilman-charged-with-obstruction-in-dog-shooting/article_57eedac6-65d6-578a-beeb-a260f543fce8.html','Thor','Unknown','1','1',2,1,0,2,2,'Uniform',3,3,0,0,0,0),(1060,'2010-04-10','Massachusetts','Beverly','Beverly Police Department',1,50,1,'English Bull Terrier','Beverly Police shot an English bull terrier to stop its attack on a 4-month-old border collie, which later had to be euthanized, Saturday, April 10. The terrier was euthanized as well. According to Beverly Police, the incident occurred at 10 a.m. near Bay and Lothrop streets, where a man was walking his border collie. Without warning, the dog was attacked by an unleashed bull terrier as the collie&rsquo;s owner tried unsuccessfully to kick the dog away. The terrier&rsquo;s owner, who tried to restrain her dog, told police the dog &ldquo;suddenly got loose from her house&rdquo; and was roaming unattended through the neighborhood. The responding officer ordered both owners to clear the area and discharged pepper spray at the terrier several times. When the dog didn&rsquo;t react to the spray and continued to attack the upper body and neck of the collie, the officer decided the dog was an &ldquo;obvious danger to other animals and people in the area&rdquo; and shot one round into the terrier&rsquo;s shoulder at close range. &ldquo;It was a pretty vicious attack, and the service officer had to use his weapon to subdue the dog,&rdquo; Beverly Police Public Information Officer April Clarizia said. The terrier finally stopped its attack, and both dogs were transported to Beverly Animal Hospital. A spokesperson for the hospital said one dog had to be euthanized. The other dog, she said, was taken to an emergency hospital, where it had to be euthanized later in the day. Although Beverly has a leash law, Animal Control Officer Jim Lindley said it is unlikely the owner of the bull terrier will be cited in the incident. The dog had gotten loose but was not intentionally without a leash. Lindley said it is possible for the border collie&rsquo;s owner to take the bull terrier&rsquo;s owner to civil court, but he believes the two owners have come to an agreement on covering veterinary costs. &ldquo;Based on preliminary reports, the dog got out of the house through a faulty door,&rdquo; Lindley said &ldquo;The owner was out looking for the dog at the time.&rdquo; Clarizia said that in recent years there haven&rsquo;t been any similar attacks in which an officer had to shoot a dog to subdue it, although there have been smaller attacks. &ldquo;There has been nothing of this magnitude in the last few years,&rdquo; she said. Although English bull terriers are not closely related to the pit bull breed, which is considered to be a more aggressive type of dog, Lindley said he could not verify for certain the actual breed without seeing the dog himself. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s what it actually was,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Sometimes, people play games with the naming of the animal to avoid using the pit bull label.&rdquo; ','http://www.wickedlocal.com/article/20100413/News/304139741','Unknown','Unknown','1','0',2,0,0,0,0,'Uniform',3,3,0,0,2,0),(1061,'2014-06-04','Oklahoma','Tulsa','Tulsa Police Department',1,2,1,'Unconfirmed','People at one north Tulsa apartment complex are upset after Tulsa police shot and killed a dog Wednesday night. They said this happened in front of several residents and children. FOX23&rsquo;s Angela Hong spoke with neighbors and police about the incident. FOX23 found out from police that a call came into 911 for a dog that was acting vicious. Right now the shooting is being reviewed as all officer-involved shootings are, but neighbors said this shouldn&rsquo;t have happened. Around 9:30 p.m. Wednesday night, the security at the Comanche Park Apartments tried to get the dog under control. Cell phone video showed the pit bull mix barking. Security pepper sprayed the dog three times, but it wouldn&rsquo;t calm down. Some neighbors told FOX23 the dog was likely scared and said it was anything but vicious. &ldquo;My kids were playing with it earlier in the day. My kids were outside when it was outside and it never once tried to attack any of my kids,&rdquo; said Tawny Glenn, a witness to the shooting. But the Tulsa Police Department said someone felt this dog was dangerous enough to call police. &ldquo;The dog might have been a friendly dog at one point but again, we were called to that location for a vicious dog,&rdquo; said Officer Leland Ashley with Tulsa police. When two Tulsa police officers got to the scene they found the dog on a porch after a few minutes of more barking neighbors heard three shots fired. &ldquo;They could have put a sheet over the dog and pinned it down. They could have brought a pole out and caught it with a breaker pole. There are a million of other things they could have done instead of shoot it in front of people,&rdquo; said Glenn. Some of the neighbors are upset that the dog was shot in front of young children, they say without warning. &ldquo;They here three to four shots and they bust out crying, wondering why it&rsquo;s happening,&rdquo; said Daniel Bass who also witnessed the shooting. But TPD said the officers did what they had to do for safety. &quot;Actions were taken at that point that officers felt needed to be taken. And unfortunately, if someone viewed it who didn&rsquo;t wish to view it, that&rsquo;s unfortunate, but as an officer you&rsquo;re first thinking of your safety and the safety of others,&rdquo; said Ashley. Neighbors told FOX23 they tried to tell security and officers they could get the dog to calm down but were repeatedly told to stay away.

One woman acts as a human shield, lying atop of the victim, while a bystander drags the dogs away by their hind legs and another uses a large stick to try and keep them at bay. But the animals continue to break free and lunge at the victim, until police officers show up and draw their pistols. Then, just as a car rolls into the frame, a series of loud gunshots ring out. Plainfield police officers shot and killed the two dogs Saturday on the 1000 block of West 7th Street, according to Police Director Martin Hellwig. The 5-year-old American bulldogs, which police and neighbors say did not have a history of violence, escaped from their backyard around 6 p.m. and attacked a woman walking down the street. &quot;These were very powerful dogs, and they were intent on doing damage,&quot; Hellwig said. The victim, whom police identified as a 55-year-old Plainfield resident, was semi-conscious and bleeding when officers arrived and found one dog with its teeth around her head. The officers shot and killed the first dog, and when the second dog ran toward the victim again, police killed it as well, Hellwig said. &ldquo;I think the officers displayed calmness and courage in the situation,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#039;m very proud of them.&quot; The victim is in stable condition Tuesday at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital, police said. She sustained numerous bites from both dogs. Shannon Gwynn was driving her boyfriend and cousin down West 7th Street when she saw the commotion. &ldquo;At first it looked like they were playing with her,&rdquo; Gwynn, 19, said. &ldquo;But I just stopped the car and I started screaming. They were on a mission &mdash; they just wanted to get at her.&rdquo; Gwynn, who took video of the ordeal and posted it to YouTube, said she tried to turn the car across the street in an attempt to hit the dogs, but there were too many people around. She wouldn&rsquo;t allow her boyfriend or cousin to get out of the car, either, because of how menacing the dogs looked as they returned again and again, biting the woman on the ground. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like it,&rdquo; Gwynn, of Edison, said. &ldquo;It was so gruesome.&rdquo; Neighbor Kashif Davis, 20, who witnessed the attack, said the dogs&rsquo; owner was the woman in the video using herself as a shield to protect the victim. &quot;The owner was lying on top of the lady to cover her,&quot; Davis said. His 24-year-old brother was the man in the video who used the large stick to keep the dogs back, he said.  Davis said police arrived quickly, and, realizing the victim was losing blood, were forced to act quickly. &quot;It took a lot to take them dogs out. After three shots, they were still running,&quot; Davis said. He said police shot the two dogs a total of 10 times as the owner stood by, watching sadly. &quot;It&#039;s tragic what happened, all the way around. Obviously no one wants to see the dogs killed, but they had to do what they had to do,&quot; Hellwig said. The dogs had been released into their backyard like any other day, Hellwig said, but the owner was unaware that her gate was left open. The dogs were able to get through the gate and into the front yard, where they attacked the victim. That gate was shut tight Tuesday, and a sign hanging from it read: &ldquo;Beware of Dogs.&rdquo; The dogs&#039; owner &mdash; who was not identified by police or neighbors &mdash; could not be reached for comment. None of the neighbors had ever complained about the dogs, Hellwig said, and an eyewitness told police they even appeared friendly just before the attack started. &ldquo;They were very nice dogs. I pet them through the gate,&quot; Davis said. The owner of the dogs, who Hellwig said does not have any history of problems with animals, was issued two summonses under a vicious dog ordinance and another two for violation of leash laws.','http://www.nj.com/union/index.ssf/2013/05/plainfield_police_shoot_2_dogs.html','Unknown','Unknown','2','0',2,1,0,1,1,'Uniform',3,3,2,0,0,0),(1063,'2002-08-22','Minnesota','Minneapolis','Minneapolis Police Department',1,2,1,'Unconfirmed','Minneapolis police shot a 11 year old boy boy named Julius Powell while trying to kill a dog during a drug raid.

United Press International described the events as follows: Dozens of people shouted at police officers and attacked reporters late Thursday after 11-year-old boy was wounded from a bullet that ricocheted from a police officer&#039;s gun, a police spokeswoman said. The officer was shooting at a pit bull dog that had been turned loose on police who were trying to serve a search warrant on a house suspected of narcotics activity.

There was a lot of activity and noise at the residence, but Banks said she wasn&#039;t aware there was drug dealing going on. Detroit Police on Thursday served between five and eight search warrants at residences suspected of drug dealing and sought 35 individuals with outstanding warrants for drug dealing, carjacking, probation violations and other crimes. It was all part of the most recent large-scale raid named Operation Cherry Blossom, one of an ongoing series of publicized raids under Operation Restore Order. The last raid, April Showers, was conducted just two weeks ago. &quot;People think they can time us, every four weeks, every three weeks; we&#039;re going to always be there.&quot; said Detroit Police Chief James Craig from the 12th Precinct before the operation commenced. &quot;You come to Detroit, it&#039;s not going to work here. &quot;Everything we are doing now is very strategic and we are responding to the problem and we will continue to do that.&quot;','http://www.mlive.com/news/detroit/index.ssf/2014/05/onlookers_disturbed_by_crude_r.html','Unknown','Unknown','1','0',1,2,2,1,1,'Uniform',1,2,2,2,2,2),(1067,'2010-06-25','Wyoming','Cheyenne','Cheyenne Police Department',1,2,0,'Unconfirmed','The following new report is based solely on police reports: Cheyenne police shot and killed a dog after a report that it was chasing a pedestrian.

The purebred blue nose pit bull named Buddy was shot by police last Sunday after he and his sister, Star, escaped Amanda Stephens&#039; yard by burrowing under a fence. &quot;They have never run away (before),&quot; Stephens said. &ldquo;They are well-maintained, well-trained dogs. They are just the most amazing dogs.&rdquo; Stephens said she plans to file a lawsuit against the sheriff&rsquo;s department and the Cheyenne Animal Shelter, which oversees the city and county&rsquo;s Animal Control officers. Bob Fecht, director of the animal shelter, said Animal Control Officer Myra Pacheco responded to a report of &ldquo;two dogs at large&rdquo; near College Drive, north of Laramie County Community College. When she arrived on the scene and exited her vehicle, Pacheco did not immediately see any dogs, Fecht said. &ldquo;Then they appeared and came full speed at her,&rdquo; Fecht said. &ldquo;She pulled out her baton to keep them at arm&rsquo;s length and backed up. Then she got back in her vehicle.&rdquo; The dogs then began to circle her vehicle. Pacheco called the sheriff&rsquo;s department for back-up, Fecht said. Soon after, two sheriff&rsquo;s deputies arrived on the scene, Fecht said. Gerry Luce, spokesman for the sheriff&rsquo;s department, identified the deputies as David Stevens and Heidi Koehler. Fecht, a former Cheyenne Police chief, said he knows Stevens personally. &ldquo;You are talking about a pretty experienced officer,&rdquo; he said. Luce said Stevens exited the police car while Koehler remained in the vehicle. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t get two steps out of the car before the dogs charged,&rdquo; Fecht said. Luce said, &ldquo;Deputy Stevens first tried to get the dogs to leave the area and retreat by yelling at them.&rdquo; The dogs continued to act in &ldquo;an extremely aggressive manor,&rdquo; and Stevens was forced to fire his service weapon and kill the dog, Luce said. After the incident, Star showed up on the nearby doorstep of Rica Robinson. Robinson described the year-and-a-half-old pit bull as &ldquo;kind and loving.&rdquo; &ldquo;She was just the sweetest thing,&rdquo; Robinson said. &ldquo;She got along with my dog, my cat, everyone.&rdquo; Robinson added, &ldquo;If they showed any aggression, it is probably because the Animal Control officer came at them with a (baton).&rdquo; She added, &ldquo;If (Buddy and Star) were anything alike, they were raised and trained to be very sweet.&rdquo; Robinson never had any contact with Buddy. Fecht said all dog breeds have innate character traits, like aggressiveness. &ldquo;But you can enhance or diminish those traits through training,&rdquo; Fecht said. &ldquo;(The Cheyenne Animal Shelter) can connect dog owners with trainers that can help dogs curtail or control those natural tendencies (like aggressiveness).&rdquo; Pit bulls are known to be a breed prone to aggressiveness. But that does not mean that all pit bulls are aggressive. It simply means they must be properly trained, Fecht said.','http://www.wyomingnews.com/articles/2014/01/25/news/01top_01-25-14.txt#.VC6T1fldXGA','Buddy','Deputy David Stevens, Deputy Heidi Koehler and Animal Control Officer Myra Pacheco ','2','0',2,0,0,2,2,'Uniform',3,3,2,2,2,0),(1069,'2014-10-02','Texas','El Paso','El Paso Police Department and El Paso Environmental Services Department',1,50,1,'Pit Bull','The El Paso Police Department said an officer shot a dog after that dog reportedly bit an animal control officer.

But a faint cry for help brought the 68-year-old Detroit man to the horrible realization that a pack of dogs on his darkened east side street Thursday night had a man pinned on the ground, attacking him, just a few houses away. &quot;I heard someone whimpering, yelling for help,&quot; Sims said Friday, standing on the porch where he witnessed something more gruesome than anything he remembered during a tour in Vietnam. &quot;I couldn&#039;t see him. All I could see was a pack of dogs. &hellip; They was aggressive. They didn&#039;t stop. I could just see them tugging, you know, pulling at him.&quot; The victim, an unidentified man who was naked when police and emergency workers got to him, lost his hands and feet in the attack in the 4500 block of Pennsylvania, between East Warren and Mack avenues, according to Police Detective Michael Pacteles, who was investigating Friday at the house where the dogs lived. Before the attack, which some accounts put as early as 9:25 or as late as 10:10 p.m., the dogs are believed to have escaped through a side door of the house. The dogs were so aggressive emergency workers were forced to remain in their vehicle until police arrived and started shooting the dogs, said Sims, who praised what he considered a speedy response time. At least one dog was fatally shot, as officers then lured the others into the house and locked them inside. When officers arrived, &quot;the man was kind of pinned down. That&#039;s why they had to do what they had to do, because his life was in jeopardy,&quot; said Detroit Police spokesman Sgt. Michael Woody, noting that the officers tried to draw the dogs away to get to the man and had to shoot one. The dogs&#039; owner, identified by a family member as Derrick Felton, was not home at the time of the attack, but Friday morning he was escorted away by police. He could face felony criminal charges, including harboring vicious animals, Woody said, but added, &quot;There&#039;s a lot more to it that we still have to get to the bottom of it.&quot; He is currently being held on an unrelated warrant for failure to pay child support and could be arraigned within days. Pacteles said the victim&#039;s hands and feet were &quot;chewed off&quot; in the attack. Woody noted in a startling revelation that all 12 dogs that had been in the home, including four puppies, were involved in the attack. Earlier reports had put the number as high as seven. None of the dogs was licensed, Woody said. &quot;Because of the viciousness of the attack, the remaining pit bulls will be euthanized,&quot; Woody said, noting that all would be tested for rabies. Police have been unable to identify the injured man, who is believed to be 40 to 50 years old. He was taken to Detroit Receiving Hospital after the attack, where he was listed in critical condition, but he has been unconscious because of his injuries, Woody said, noting that he lost a lot of blood. The man could speak, barely, when police and emergency workers got to him, but he was unable to provide his name. It&#039;s unclear why he was naked or if the dogs had ripped his clothes off, and it&#039;s unclear what led to the attack or why the man was in the area. Detective Pacteles said the dogs that were seized Friday were thin and looked malnourished. He called the condition of the home, which had ample clutter visible through an open front door, &quot;deplorable. ... I took one step in and it smelled pretty bad.&quot; The attack comes less than three months after 46-year-old Craig Sytsma of Livonia was mauled to death by two Cane Corsos while he was jogging in rural Lapeer County. Those dogs had bitten people in previous attacks, and the dogs&#039; owners, Sebastiano Quagliata, 45, and his wife, Valbona Lucaj, 44, have been charged with second-degree murder. In echoes of the events leading up to that attack in July, neighbors on Pennsylvania offered disturbing descriptions of the dogs regularly running loose and chasing people. Wanda Webb, 70, said she had told Felton that his dogs were a problem and had called animal control numerous times to complain. &quot;My grandkids can&#039;t go outside because the dogs (are always) chasing them,&quot; she said. &quot;Nobody walks up and down this street without having something in their hands&quot; to keep the dogs away. Several neighbors said police and animal control had responded at times, but the dogs would usually just hide, and nothing was done about them. Despite their concerns, neighbors spoke generally favorably about Felton, a man who, according to his nephew Meldanaldo Murchison, is a &quot;good guy.&quot; Murchison, who was preparing to lock up the house, which had been left open after the dogs were seized, said his uncle had worked at a number of locations, detailing cars. Murchison said he had no idea his uncle had more than perhaps four dogs, but insisted that the dogs were not being bred for any particular purpose, that they were just dogs having puppies. &quot;I feel sorry for the man, (but) I don&#039;t want my uncle to do any time.

On Saturday, Lewis says she was with her family at her daughter&#039;s softball game in Lexington. She got a phone call around 8:00 a.m. that her security alarm had gone off at her home on Eagle Pass Road in Shelbyville. The security alarm company asked if she wanted police to check it out. &quot;We had recent burglary in the neighborhood so, I said yeah send somebody out,&quot; said Lewis. Lewis says a Shelby County Deputy responded to the home and that&#039;s when the deputy ran into Daisy. &quot;He walked in the backyard and then they had a face off and he shot her,&quot; said Lewis. &quot;She was protecting our home.&quot; &quot;It&#039;s a tragic situation no one got up that morning wanting to hurt a dog,&quot; said Shelby County Sheriff Mike Armstrong. Sheriff Armstrong says his deputy had no other option than to shoot Daisy. He says Daisy was acting aggressive and his deputy had to make a quick decision. WAVE 3 asked why the deputy didn&#039;t use pepper spray or a taser. &quot;Yes, there are options that he had available on his belt but, it takes longer to retrieve those pieces of equipment,&quot; said Sheriff Armstrong. &quot;She has never lunged at anyone or bitten anyone,&quot; said Lewis. Lewis&#039;s 12-year-old Daughter Jenna, who was the closest to Daisy, felt she had to do something. &quot;I wrote a letter to the Sheriff about my dog and my memories of her and her personality,&quot; said Jenna Lewis. &quot;I don&#039;t feel that it&#039;s right and I don&#039;t think she should have died like that.&quot; Lewis says there were no signs of a break in and doesn&#039;t know exactly why her alarm went off that morning.

He adds that as tragic as this situation is, he hopes something good will come out of it.

Although the lawsuit is directed toward Berry and the sheriff&rsquo;s office, it includes the fiscal court which is the entity that oversees Root&#039;s office. Michael Joseph Swanson, Kyla Byrge and a minor are suing the defendants for &ldquo;gross negligence, recklessness, ill will, and oppression, and total disregard for the property rights of the plaintiffs,&rdquo; according to the law suit filed by Attorney David O. Smith on Aug. 15. The first count of the suit states, &ldquo;The officer, Kevin Berry, intentionally, willfully, negligently, and recklessly, and without provocation or privilege to do so, destroyed the plaintiff&rsquo;s dog, &lsquo;Bella&rsquo;, by shooting Bella with a handgun, without justification, in an inhumane manner, resulting in her slow, painful death.&rdquo; Further counts in the law suit claim the minor was inflicted with severe emotion distress following the shooting and that Kayla Byrge was verbally harassed, intimidated and threatened. The suit also claims that the Laurel County Sheriff Department failed to properly train Deputy Berry and was negligent in his hiring. Sheriff Root said that on July 23 Deputy Berry responded to a complaint of a vicious dog that had attacked a smaller dog earlier in the day. Berry was investigating the matter when he noticed a small child in a house seemingly alone. Berry eventually made contact with an adult in the home and, as he was leaving, spotted a dog charging toward him. Root said the dog tried to bite Berry and it was then that the dog, Bella, was shot. &ldquo;We hate that it happened, but (Berry) did what he had to do,&rdquo; Root said during a July interview. Now, the law suit is requesting repayment of &ldquo;compensatory, consequential and special damages,&rdquo; along with punitive damages in excess of $5,000. Attorney David O.

Although the &quot;suit says police had a warrant that indicated they suspected drug dealing or gang activity&quot; on the Hendersons&#039; premises, the raid&#039;s victims disagree. They &quot;claim the visit from the county SWAT team was &#039;suspect&#039; because a nearby house the police raided later that evening more closely matched the warrant&#039;s description, and contained marijuana, a pair of scales and large sums of money.&quot; However, as the Daily Record states, &quot;Unlike the white woman who lived in that house [...], the Hendersons, who are black, were charged with drug possession - even though a visitor to their house confessed to owning the paraphernalia found on their coffee table and the marijuana found in [the visitor&#039;s own] jacket.&quot; According to the Hendersons&rsquo; suit, at 10:15 the night of the raid, the SWAT team entered the family&rsquo;s unlocked door without announcing themselves, tapped on the door to entice the Hendersons&rsquo; dogs, Grunt and Smidget, to run to them, and shot Grunt, a rottweiler-labrador mix, according to the lawsuit. The suit alleged that an officer assaulted Kevin Henderson, throwing him to the floor and roughed up Lisa Henderson, allegedly picking her up, while handcuffed, and dragging her across the floor. Their visitor was &quot;immediately arrested,&quot; but &quot;the Hendersons were charged only after Lisa Henderson called to complain about the raid,&quot; contends the attorney representing the family, Jimmy A.

He was a puppy,&rdquo; Bryan said. &ldquo;He would be more likely to run up and lick you and run away than do anything else. He was just a big teddy bear.&rdquo; Fort Worth police officials confirmed last week that Flynn, who has been with the department since 1984, had been stripped of his gun and badge and placed on desk duty while under investigation for shooting the dog. On Monday, Cpl. Tracey Knight, a police spokeswomen, said Flynn, 61, has now been placed on &ldquo;detached duty,&rdquo; meaning he is also not allowed to go into the office and must check in daily with a supervising assistant chief. Police officials would not comment Monday on whether the three officers are also under investigation for not initially filing a police report on the shooting, nor would the officials release the officers&rsquo; identities. &ldquo;This continues to be an open investigation,&rdquo; Knight said. &ldquo;All aspects of this incident will be thoroughly investigated by Internal Affairs detectives.&rdquo; Cruelty to an animal is a state-jail felony punishable by up to two years in a state jail and a $10,000 fine. The woman said she was driving home from work shortly before 6 p.m. Sept. 29 when she noticed a brown and white pit bull roaming on the south side of Oak Grove East. The woman said she turned around her car, stopped and put her flashers on, to see if she could coax the pit bull toward her. By that time, a black SUV with a side spotlight pulled into a nearby driveway and the driver got out. She said the man started waving her off. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who this guy is,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to shoot the dog. He killed my cat,&rsquo; &rdquo; she recalled. &ldquo;I realized all of a sudden that he&rsquo;s talking about the dog that is closer to him ... a black German shepherd.&rdquo; The woman said the man then pulled out a gun, which scared her, but also prompted her to try to talk him out of his plan. &ldquo;Look, sir, I have dogs and cats. I know it&rsquo;s horrible thing to go through. I would be upset too,&rdquo; she said, retelling her conversation. She said the man got back inside his SUV, called her a &ldquo;stupid&rdquo; or &ldquo;dumb b----,&rdquo; then backed up to drive away. &ldquo;The dog is trying to get away,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The dog is not trying to attack anybody. He&rsquo;s trying to get away. He&rsquo;s trying to go home.&rdquo; The woman, who had turned back to the pit bull, heard four or five gunshots. &ldquo;He was down the road about three-tenths of a mile when he fired the shots,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There were no other vehicles around.&rdquo; The woman said she called 911, describing the fleeing SUV and the man with a gun to dispatchers. She then drove to the house closest to where the SUV had stopped, where she talked to another woman who had witnessed the shooting. The witness told her the German shepherd had run off but believed it had been hit &ldquo;because it yelped.&rdquo; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not supposed to shoot an animal unless it&rsquo;s on your property and it&rsquo;s endangering you or your animal,&rdquo; the woman said. &ldquo;He was hunting [this dog] down. They were not on his property. He was not being rational.&rdquo; The woman said three Fort Worth officers and a Tarrant County sheriff&rsquo;s deputy responded to her 911 call, interviewed both women, then took off in search of the black SUV. The deputy returned a few minutes later to tell the women that Fort Worth police would be handling the case because they had jurisdiction, she said. &ldquo;He said the officers has made contact with the man. He works for Fort Worth PD. He said the dog killed his cat and he did nothing wrong,&rdquo; the woman said. &ldquo;I said, &lsquo;He fired shots, sir. This is the city limits. He was not on his property.&rsquo; &rdquo; About 9 p.m., concerned that she had not heard from any Fort Worth officers, the woman said she called 911 again and asked dispatchers for the report number in regard to the shooting. Dispatchers located her earlier call to 911 but told the woman that no police report had been made. &ldquo;I said, &lsquo;Sir, shots were fired by this man,&rsquo; &rdquo; the woman said. Surprised that no report had been made, the woman said she expressed her concerns to a dispatch supervisor. By midnight, a Fort Worth lieutenant had left a message on the woman&rsquo;s cellphone, asking for her to return the call. They talked about 4 a.m. and later that morning, investigators came to the woman&rsquo;s house, interviewing her and asking her to pick the shooter out of photo line-up. &ldquo;If I had not followed up, none of this would have happened,&rdquo; the woman said. Bryan, a college student, said he immediately began searching for his dogs after returning home Monday afternoon and finding them missing. &ldquo;I went to six different dog pounds and animal control locations looking for them but they weren&rsquo;t there,&rdquo; Bryan said. &ldquo;I looked all through Fort Worth, Crowley and Burleson.&rdquo; The woman said she later learned that the German shepherd was found dead in the area the day after the shooting, and its body was picked up by animal control. She said she kept the pit bull at her house, posting signs in the neighborhood in an attempt to find her owner. On Wednesday, she got a phone call from Bryan. &ldquo;I was actually on my way out the door to search some more when one my roommates had called and said that he saw a sign that said &lsquo;found brown and white pit bull,&rsquo; &rdquo; Bryan said. &ldquo;I called the number.&rdquo; The woman informed him that the pit bull was safe at her house. She said she then delivered the bad news about his German shepherd. &ldquo;I said, I am sorry to tell you, but he&rsquo;s been shot dead by an off-duty officer,&rdquo; she said. Bryan said Bentley had killed only small possums in the past. &ldquo;The neighborhood kids used to ride him around like a pony,&rdquo; Bryan said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen him growl or bare his teeth at anything.&rdquo; He said he doesn&rsquo;t know whether Bentley attacked and killed Flynn&rsquo;s cat. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I wasn&rsquo;t there,&rdquo; Bryan said. &ldquo;All I know is if I did what he did, I would be in jail right now. &ldquo;If the dog was in his yard and actually killed his cat, then maybe he would have had the right to shoot it,&rdquo; Bryan said. &ldquo;But the fact that he chased him down in his truck and shot him and drove away and didn&rsquo;t report it, that makes it a completely different thing.&rdquo; A grand jury was convened to review charges against Deputy Police Chief Kenneth Flynn.

According to the lawsuit, a team of officers was trying to catch a fugitive but ended up at the wrong house, with an innocent bystander getting shot: an old mixed-breed pooch named Chloe. Chloe survived, but has had three surgeries and lost part of her tongue and one canine tooth. Her breed is not known. Her owners claim their constitutional rights were violated: the officers unreasonably destroyed or seized their property, in this case, Chloe, which is prohibited under the Fourth Amendment. Here, according to the lawsuit filed Oct. 3 in U.S. District Court, is what triggered the suit. Flint residents Erica Morena and Katti Putnam were sitting in their house on June 18 when their home was suddenly raided by police. They were looking for a fugitive, who was actually next door. A Michigan Department of Corrections investigator went in their backyard. Chloe the dog heard commotion and came down the stairs of the house and ventured out the back door, which was open, and made her way to the backyard. That&#039;s when the investigator shot her right below the nose, according to a neighbor who witnessed the shooting. She had on a collar. She wasn&#039;t barking. And she has no history of biting anyone. Chloe&#039;s owners heard the shot and ran to her rescue. They also heard the troopers say they were at the wrong house. The officers told Chloe&#039;s owners to take her to the vet and said, &quot;We&#039;ll take care of this.&quot; The owners went to the vet, then got a lawyer: Royal Oak attorney Christopher Olson, who has filed several similar dog shooting lawsuits. &quot;They really had no right to be there,&quot; Olson said of the officers. &quot;The police went to the wrong house and shot these folks dog in their own back yard. They turned the situation into a violent one.&quot; And, he added, &quot;they recognized there was a mistake.&quot; MDOC officials were not available for comment. Olson, who is seeking unspecified punitive and compensatory damages, said this is not an isolated incident. He has several dog injury lawsuits pending against police, including one that wound up in Time Magazine. Police nationwide are mishandling dog encounters because they have &quot;zero training&quot; in this area, he said, noting such video training is available for free online. &quot;Had they followed the protocols in these training videos, this would not have happened,&quot; Olson said of Chloe&#039;s shooting. &quot;It&#039;s too bad not only for my clients and the dog ... but this is something that is a nationwide epidemic. It&#039;s a big problem and it&#039;s something that doesn&#039;t necessarily have to happen.&quot; In Chloe&#039;s case, he said: &quot;There was time, and when there&#039;s time, you need to isolate the dog.&quot; Olson also said the officers have not made good on their promise to &quot;take care of this.&quot; He said Chloe&#039;s veterinary bill still has not been covered. And when his clients call the police or state officials about it, he said, no one returns their calls. June 18 proved to be a tough day for Chloe&#039;s owners on a number of levels. Olson noted that when they drove Chloe to the vet, they got pulled over by a state trooper for speeding. They avoided a ticket, however. And the trooper gave them an escort to the vet clinic.','http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/10/08/dog-shot-police-suit/16904333/','Chloe','Department of Corrections officer Michael Hughes and Unknown SWAT team','0','1',2,0,0,2,2,'Not Sure',0,2,2,2,1,0),(1083,'2014-10-09','New York','Hartland','Niagara County Sheriffs Office',2,2,1,'Unconfirmed','The following is a media report from the Buffalo News.

Julie L. Radibeau&#039;s dog, Dakota, was shot after it crossed Sheridan Road and strayed into the yard of Officer Thomas Jacobi in March 1999. Dakota was taken to a veterinarian but died two days later. When Radibeau learned of her 3&frac12; year-old Rottweiler&#039;s death, Radibeau collapsed and needed medical treatment, according to court documents. Circuit Judge Allan Torhorst interpreted Rabideau&#039;s suit as claims for intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress and dismissed it, saying only the loss of a spouse, child, parent, sibling or grandparent would allow Radibeau to bring such a suit. Torhorst was upheld last year on appeal, but the Wisconsin Supreme Court gave the case another interpretation and returned it for more consideration, giving Rabideau&#039;s attorney Alan Eisenberg, of Milwaukee, what he called the &quot;most profound&quot; victory in his well publicized 35-year career. &quot;The case was plain and simple about property damages, and animal rights had nothing to do with it. It had to do with human rights. Dakota was Julie&#039;s property and family,&quot; Eisenberg said. In writing the unanimous decision, Justice William Bablitch stated that the court is &quot;uncomfortable with the characterization of a dog, such as Dakota, as mere property.&quot; Calling a dog property in the legal sense fails to embrace the role canines have played for centuries in human experience, Bablitch wrote. In their long association with humans, Bablitch noted that dogs have herded animals, provided assistance to law enforcement, the blind, security and &quot;devoted friendship.&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;A companion dog is not a living room sofa or dining room furniture. This term inadequately and inaccurately describes the relationship between a human and a dog,&quot; Bablitch wrote in the 21-page opinion.\r\n\r\nEisenberg said he did not think of seeking loss of companionship until he received a phone call from an Oregon attorney while Eisenberg was driving to Madison to argue the case before the state&#039;s high court.\r\n\r\nTuesday&#039;s opinion did not address the companionship issue but in her concurring opinion, Chief Justice Shirely Abrahamson said the state of Tennessee allows victims to collect up to $4,000 for loss of companionship when their pet dog is negligently killed.\r\n\r\nBecause the case was returned for consideration of whether Jacobi was entitled to shoot Dakota, Eisenberg said he can amend the suit and add the loss of companionship claim.\r\n\r\nRacine Assistant City Attorney William Scott Lewis who argued the case before the Wisconsin Supreme Court was unavailable for comment Tuesday.\r\n\r\nCity Attorney Daniel Wright also was unavailable.\r\n\r\nEisenberg will ask for another judge to hear the case which will determine if Jacobi shot Dakota to protect his daughter and Jacobi&#039;s Chesapeake Bay retriever, Jed.\r\n\r\nIn a deposition, Jacobi said that the Rotweiler&#039;s jumping out of Rabideau&#039;s truck, crossing the street and approacing his dog and daughter caused him to fear for their safety. Jacobi drew his service revolver and hit Dakota with the third shot he fired, according to court documents.\r\n\r\nState law allows someone to kill a dog only if the person is threatend with serious bodily harm and immediate action is necessary.\r\n\r\nA police officer can kill a dog in the lawful performance of his duties.\r\n\r\nA person who violated the law is liable for double damages.\r\n\r\nNeither the police department or the district attorney&#039;s office disciplined Jacobi in connection with the shooting, Eisenberg said.\r\n\r\nRabideau and other witnesses will testify that Dakota was not threatening Jed or Jacobi&#039;s daughter, Eisenberg said.','http://journaltimes.com/news/local/court-racine-woman-can-sue-for-dog-s-death/article_264d9f96-5712-5967-ae84-d7933434236d.html','Dakota','Thomas Jacobi','0','0',1,0,1,0,0,'Plain Clothes',3,3,0,0,1,0),(1089,'1990-10-20','Minnesota','Minneapolis','Minneapolis Police Department',1,50,0,'German Shepherd','Jon Soucek was the owner of a one-and-a-half-year-old shepherd-mix dog. The dog was an obedience-trained family pet known in the neighborhood to be gentle. The dog got along well with family, friends, and neighbors, including children. At approximately 11:30 p.m. on October 20, 1990, the dog accidentally got loose from respondent&#039;s back yard. At around the same time on the same night, the Minneapolis police dispatcher received calls from two different people identifying what they believed to be a &quot;wolf.&quot; At approximately 2:26 a.m., Officer Banham spotted the animal near Third Street and Second Avenue in downtown Minneapolis. Less than two minutes later, Officer Banham ordered that the animal be &quot;taken.&quot; Within one-and-a-half minutes, the animal had been shot between seven and fifteen times by three different officers. Shortly thereafter, Laura Reavis, a warden of the Minneapolis Animal Control, arrived on the scene, but the dog was already dead. The animal was transported to the Minneapolis Animal Control facility. Respondent Soucek did not find out about the death of his dog until the next day. According to Soucek, when he discovered the dog had gotten loose on the night of the incident, he went looking for it from approximately 12:45 a.m. until 3:30 a.m. Unsuccessful in his search, he went to bed. The following morning, when he saw that the dog had not returned home, he telephoned the dog pound and was told a dog similar in description had been shot and killed the night before. When respondent asked why they did not call him, he was told the dog had no identification tags on it. This relieved respondent&#039;s fears somewhat because his dog wore a collar and I.D. tags. Respondent, accompanied by his roommate and a friend, went to the dog pound. When they arrived at the pound, respondent was taken to a metal shack in the back of the building. On the floor of the shack was a dog that was &quot;shot up.&quot; Respondent turned the dog over and recognized it as his dog. Respondent cried as he held the dead animal. He told his friend to get his roommate back so she would not see the dog. Respondent&#039;s description includes graphic details of the scene. Eventually, after some difficulty because of the large amount of blood, respondent got the body of his dog into the trunk of his car. While at the pound, respondent was told that although the dog had not done anything wrong, the dog was shot because the police thought it was a wolf. In his deposition testimony, Banham said he believed the animal was a wolf when he shot at it. Banham testified that when he first saw the animal at 2:25 a.m., it was on the sidewalk along Third Avenue. Banham drove parallel with the animal and was within ten feet of it. In an attempt to ascertain whether it was a dog, Banham called and whistled to it. The animal continued walking or trotting in the same direction. It did not come toward Banham nor did it shy away. When Banham first saw it, it was trotting on the sidewalk of either Washington or Third Avenue. It moved into the street at one point, then back toward the sidewalk. Banham claimed he did not see a collar on the animal. According to Banham, although the animal took no aggressive action toward him, he decided to shoot at what he believed to be a wolf for reasons of public safety. After he fired four shots, the animal collapsed but was still alive. Banham then told Officer Hamilton to shoot the animal with a shotgun for humane purposes. Hamilton did so. Officer Banham then approached the animal and, because it was still alive, shot it again. Banham also stated that Officer Hedberg took &quot;a bunch of shots.&quot; Banham stated that upon the arrival of the animal warden, Laura Reavis, two of his officers helped her load the animal onto a truck. Soucek brought an action against the officers and the city of Minneapolis alleging negligence per se, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent infliction of emotional distress, and negligent supervision. Soucek presented to the court at the summary judgment hearing several affidavits by eyewitnesses directly contradicting the official or police version of the facts, including from city animal control employees. Animal Control Warden Laura Reavis described the scene as follows: &quot;I told them to hold off shooting him because I was almost there. Upon arrival, the dog was already dead. There was a great deal of happiness and celebration by the police. They were laughing and saying, &quot;We got the dog, we got the dog.&quot; It was clear they knew it wasn&#039;t a wolf. At first they said to me, sarcastically, I felt, &quot;Get back? It&#039;s still alive!&quot; I told them it was dead. They said, &quot;It should be we blasted it enough.&quot; 3. When I attempted to load the dog into my truck I was pushed out of the way so the police could take pictures. They took turns posing over the dog as if they were bounty hunters. They would put one foot on the dog and hold a rifle while another cop would take a picture. One officer with dark hair and a mustache came up to me with a big grin and said, &quot;Nice looking `wolf&#039;, huh?&quot; In a tone of voice emphasizing he knew it wasn&#039;t a wolf, but that he would pretend it was.&quot; She went on to describe how her supervisors lied to the courts and threatened her job in order to keep her silent: &quot;Also, every time Mr. Soucek tried to contact me about what I saw, my supervisors lied to him about my not being in town or out on call when they had actually been keeping me busy in the back of the shelter. 7. They also told me that I&#039;d better not talk to Soucek or his lawyers. I was afraid for my job at that time, but now that I don&#039;t work there anymore, I feel I can come forward with what I saw.&quot; The claims for emotional distress were later dismissed. Soucek moved to amend his complaint to include a claim for punitive damages. The trial court initially granted Soucek&#039;s motion. Shortly after the trial court&#039;s decision, however, the supreme court issued its opinion in Independent School District No. 622 v. Keene Corp., 511 N.W.2d 728 (Minn.1994). In light of the Keene opinion, respondents brought a motion for reconsideration of the trial court&#039;s decision permitting the punitive damages claim. The trial court determined that Keene precluded punitive damages and reversed its decision. Soucek also requested that the measure of compensatory damages include the intrinsic value of his dog as a pet. The trial court ruled that compensatory damages were limited to the replacement cost of the dog, which the parties had stipulated was no greater than $1500. Soucek was awarded $1500. The lawsuit moved to appellate, where the court overturned the prior logic of Wilson v. City of Eagan and decided that Soucek cannot recover punitive damages for the loss of his pet because he only suffered property damage. Compensatory damages for the loss of Soucek&#039;s pet are limited to the fair market value of the animal. Judge Lansing notably dissented from the decision. Lansing pointed out that the decision the court used to justify siding with the killers of the Soucek&#039;s dog, Independent School Dist. No. 622 v. Keene Corp., only limits punitive damages for product-related damages. Only by reading the decision out of its obvious context can one hold that the same rules apply to the destruction of inanimate property and the murder of living companion animals.','http://law.justia.com/cases/minnesota/court-of-appeals/1993/c2-92-2466.html','Mack','Donald Banham, Jr., Dennis Hamilton, Kim Hedberg and mulitiple unknown police','1','0',2,0,0,0,2,'Uniform',3,3,0,0,1,1),(1090,'2014-10-08','Alabama','Montgomery','Montgomery Police Department, U.S. Attorneys Office and Federal Bureau of Investigation',1,2,1,'Unconfirmed','A Montgomery neighborhood is demanding answers after officers shot and killed a dog during a major bust last week.

They say he regularly played with her children, was known for helping neighbors with their groceries, and even picked up trash up and down the street. Striker was lying in the doorway of one of the homes Wednesday when officers approached, executing a warrant to arrest his owner. &ldquo;He said y&#039;all can come in, I got my dog right here, he shot the dog, and he begged him not to shoot the dog, begged him not to shoot the dog, said he was crying, then he shot him 3 more times and threw him down on the bed,&rdquo; Hamilton explained about the day of the raid. &ldquo;They was hollering Striker&#039;s name, and everybody was wondering about Striker.&quot; The U.S. Attorney&#039;s Office says agents typically try not to involve pets in their arrest, unless they become aggressive toward agents. Hamilton and her family believe the agents should have been better prepared. The arrest warrants were the result of an FBI Safe Streets Task Force and Montgomery police investigation that started back in 2010. &ldquo;I feel like the dog was discriminated against just because of his breed,&rdquo; Hamilton said. &quot;Investigating him for four years, so I think they should have known he had a dog if they was investigating him for four years.&quot; Hamilton and other neighbors held two candlelight vigils in memory of Striker.

Ernest Rael, who called the dog his companion and best friend, said he owned Lucky for five years. &ldquo;What upsets me most is that they can kill my dog and just walk away. We had a bond; he was that dog that was one in a million,&rdquo; Rael said. On Sunday, Oct. 5, Rael came back to his mother&rsquo;s house on Don Jacobo, where he lives, after spending the morning at church. When he noticed there was blood on the ground, he asked his mother, Mary Ann Garcia, what happened. Rael said she told him someone called the Bosque Farms Police Department and one of the responding officers had shot his dog.\r\nRael wasn&rsquo;t home at the time of the shooting, but Garcia alleged that this was just another incident of BFPD trying to violate her Fourth Amendment rights, which protects citizens from unreasonable searches and seizures, as well as arbitrary arrests. &ldquo;They had come to harass me and hospitalize me,&rdquo; Garcia said. &ldquo;They said they were called to do a welfare check.&rdquo; Garcia said the officers &mdash; Richard Pries and Jermaine Wilkins &mdash; had their hands on their guns as they approached her home. &ldquo;I was like, &lsquo;Hands up, don&rsquo;t shoot.&rsquo; I wouldn&rsquo;t come out; I said I was doing fine,&rdquo; she said. Garcia said Wilkins was being &ldquo;forceful on the door,&rdquo; when Pries shot and killed the animal. She alleges Wilkins told her the dog was shot because she would not come out of the house. The dog was barking at the officers, unrestrained in the yard, Garcia said. &ldquo;Last time I went to court, they said they had been (to her house) 45 times; they knew I have a dog,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They wanted to seize me again and have me arrested and hospitalized. &ldquo;It takes two officers to say I&rsquo;m incompetent and hospitalize me. They said they were going to file a criminal complaint against me for having a vicious dog on the property. They are taking advantage of their power.&rdquo; Capt. David Gallegos, the Bosque Farms Police Department&rsquo;s public information officer, said the officers were dispatched to Garcia&rsquo;s address due to an ongoing neighbor dispute. &ldquo;There is a long history with that address,&rdquo; Gallegos said. The lieutenant said when officers initially knocked on the door, there was no answer. At some point, he said, a woman opened the door and said something, which was when one or two dogs came out of the house. &ldquo;The dog was probably doing its job, saw a stranger and was barking. I wouldn&rsquo;t say it was initially aggressive,&rdquo; Gallegos said. He said the officer attempted to push the dog away with his foot and it became more aggressive. &ldquo;The officer was afraid he was going to be attacked. He fired one round and killed the dog,&rdquo; he said. As far as Garcia&rsquo;s contention that the shooting was an attempt to get her out of the house, Gallegos said he had no reason or information to believe that was the case. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say any of our officers would do that, especially this officer who is a big animal lover,&rdquo; Gallegos said. &ldquo;I have not received any complaints from anyone making that allegation. If she believes that, she is welcome to file a complaint and it will be looked into.&rdquo; Gallegos said Pries&rsquo; sergeant, Dawne Roberto, was instructed to review the incident to make sure everything was done properly. &ldquo;I have not been notified of anything negative. I think it is fair to say the officer used the amount of force he thought necessary to stop the dog from attacking,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I certainly feel for the family as a dog owner myself.&rdquo; Rael said Lucky was part of the family. &ldquo;He knew tricks, was obedient, a very smart dog,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What I want most is just to shine a light on the wrong doing; they knew they did wrong.

Just before 10:30 a.m., San Angelo police were dispatched to the 700 block of Veck Street for the report of a vicious animal problem where two dogs attempted to attack a man as he exited his vehicle. Animal Control officials were also dispatched to the scene. Once on scene, a San Angelo police officer spoke with the complainant who pointed out two dogs that were in front of a nearby residence. The man told police the dogs charged him as he exited his pickup truck and narrowly avoided the attack by jumping into the truck&rsquo;s bed. Police attempts to locate the dogs&rsquo; owner was unsuccessful. Once Animal Control arrived, the officers attempted to locate the dogs, which were no longer in sight. When the officers attempted to locate the dogs behind a residence, one dog aggressively charged towards the officers from an adjacent yard, forcing the Animal Control officer to strike the dog on its head with a catch pole. After being struck, the dog circled around a vehicle and aggressively charged the patrol officer at which point the officer drew his service weapon and fired two rounds at the dog.  After the shots were fired, the dog ran away. Attempts to locate the dog were unsuccessful and it was unknown at the time if the two rounds made contact with the dog. The second dog was later located hiding underneath a porch, unharmed. The officers were not injured during the incident. Animal Control officials contacted the owners and requested their presence at the residence. Upon their arrival, they found their dog had returned to the residence and was suffering from a gunshot wound to the face. Animal Control officials released the dog to the owner and the dog was transported to Los Caballos Veterinary Clinic for treatment. The dog is reportedly undergoing surgery at this time. Prior to today&rsquo;s incident, San Angelo Police and Animal Control officials have responded to the location multiple times regarding the dogs.

Wrapped in her arms was Copper, a 6-year-old boxer who liked to dance on his hind legs and wave his nub in the air. Informed of the officers&rsquo; presence, Francis roused from her sleep to put her dog into the backyard before dealing with the confusion. He never made it that far. As Copper padded a few feet in front of her, Francis heard a loud crack and saw what looked like crimson glitter wisp through the air. A veteran Modesto Police Department officer had fired a bullet into Copper&rsquo;s face. The dog would later die on a veterinarian&rsquo;s table, another four-legged victim of a police shooting&mdash;something critics say is a needlessly routine occurrence. &ldquo;Once I looked into it, I realized how common it was,&rdquo; Francis told SN&amp;R. &ldquo;It turned my stomach.&rdquo; Modesto police acknowledge they entered the wrong duplex. According to a police incident summary, officers entered through a sliding glass door after announcing their presence. They say a suspicious male retreated to the back while refusing to identify himself. &ldquo;While trying to get to the male, an officer was confronted by an aggressive dog,&rdquo; the summary reads. &ldquo;The male was asked to take control of the dog. The dog continued to chase the officer. The dog was shot by the officer.&rdquo; Francis contends otherwise. As she led Copper toward the backyard&rsquo;s glass-panel door, she said she heard a man&rsquo;s voice call out, &ldquo;Dog! Dog!&rdquo; And then the gunshot. She said there were several signs that animals resided there&mdash;including leashes near the front porch, an unlocked security screen that provided a clear view into the residence and a literal sign by the door saying there were dogs inside. &ldquo;They had to walk through their potty area,&rdquo; she added. Francis consulted a lawyer a few months later, but didn&rsquo;t pursue it. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not going to bring my Copper back.&rdquo; Her daughter did file an official complaint with the Modesto Police Department. In a response letter dated August 13, 2013, police Chief Galen Carroll wrote that the involved officer was &ldquo;exonerated&rdquo; of wrongdoing following &ldquo;an extensive investigation.&rdquo; Francis said no one interviewed her or any of the other people inside her home who witnessed the shooting. Citing pending litigation, Modesto police spokeswoman Heather Graves declined to release details of the investigation. &ldquo;I can say, however, that our hearts go out to the family for their loss, as we understand pets are often a member of the family,&rdquo; she wrote in an email. The incident left its troubling imprint. Francis finds herself wondering whether police deliberately entered her home to kill the dog she referred to as her &ldquo;grandson.&rdquo; She also worries about the special-needs son who witnessed the bloody aftermath and has been unable to process the loss. &ldquo;Now he will absolutely &hellip; hate cops,&rdquo; Francis said of her 10-year-old.','http://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/paws-up-dont-shoot-activists/content?oid=15220991','Copper','Unknown','2','0',1,0,2,0,0,'Uniform',0,2,0,0,2,0),(1095,'2014-01-22','California','Oceanside','Oceanside Police Department and San Diego Juvenile Probation',1,2,1,'Unconfirmed','A county probation officer shot and killed a dog that lunged at her in an aggressive manner Wednesday night in the backyard of an Oceanside house, police said.

The same event was published by the Modesto Bee, which is based entirely on police statements and fails to mention the use of less-lethal weaponry against dogs toward a house filled with children; the Bee also fails to mention that the case against the teenagers arrested appears to be entirely without merit based on eyewitness testimony of the shooters and negative gun powder residue tests: Greg and Anthony&#039;s family, who pride themselves on getting their kids to and from school every day and on their work in the contracting business, were relaxing on a Monday evening when they heard gun shots. They became aware of the gravity of the situation as they saw two young men running through their yard. The family&#039;s neighbor then alerted them that one of the runners had dropped a hand gun in their yard. Greg, a contractor who was only a few days away from getting off parole on a DUI charge, didn&rsquo;t want a gun in his yard nor want it around children and went to go get the handgun while his girlfriend, Kenny Nunez and her two boys, Anthony and Thomas, waved the police over to the house, thinking that they could hand them the gun and get on with their evening. When police quickly arrived to the scene however, the families&rsquo; dogs began barking and one even jumped over the fence to meet the cops head on. Police then began firing on the dog with rubber bullets while Kenny attempted to get the dog back inside the gate without being shot herself. Once Kenny had taken the dogs inside the house, police entered the yard in droves and began detaining those on the property. Greg was arrested after he attempted to give the police the firearm that was left in his yard. Police would later claim he was trying to &ldquo;wipe off the fingerprints&rdquo; on the gun. Police then proceeded to detain the entire family outside including Kenny, her daughter, and her two twin sons, one of which was Anthony. According to Kenny in her interviews, Anthony verbally stood up to the cops and told them how he felt about the situation and what the police were doing to his family, resulting in the police setting upon him with a barrage of questioning. Anthony remained clear in his resolve that he was not involved in the shooting and had not left his house during the evening. Police also took this time to insult Anthony, calling him repeatedly a &quot;pussy.&quot; Anthony was then arrested by police and put into a cop car. Kenny said that she wanted to speak with him before he was taken anywhere or interviewed by police. She also explained to the police over and over again that all of her children were inside the house with her and had not left the house since they returned home from school - and that they were not involved with the shooting. Police insisted that Anthony was the driver of the car that was involved in the drive-by shooting and told Kenny they were going to take him in for questioning. It should be noted that neither of Kenny&rsquo;s twins know how to drive, or have drivers&#039; licenses (they are both are 17). By this point, the police had entered and ransacked the house looking for evidence connecting the family to the shooting. They found nothing. Although police told Kenny that they would not question or leave with Anthony before talking to her, they proceeded to shut the cop car doors and drive off, with Anthony on his way to the Modesto Police Station and then Juvenile Hall. Anthony&rsquo;s family was then left to survey the destruction that the police had left. Two of their dogs had been shot with rubber bullets. Several of the windows of their home had been broken out. They also found several burn marks on the ground which they believe to be the remnants of flash or smoke grenades (before the police left, they were reminding each other to &lsquo;pick up the canisters.&rsquo;) Almost two weeks have passed since the arrest of Greg and Anthony, and both remain in custody. Greg, although his charges have been dropped, is waiting to finish with the parole board and be released. Anthony faces multiple felony charges, even though police have tested (swabbed) him for gunpowder residue, and the results have come up negative. After the arrest, Kenny and a neighbor who witnessed the event visited the Modesto Police station in an attempt to explain that the men they saw running did not include, nor look anything like Anthony.

Deputies responding to several 911 calls found the man being mauled by three pit bulls in the backyard of his home and a fourth pit bull circling him. Deputies shot and killed two of the dogs.

The Yeager family, who has lived in their home on Clearmont Street for 22 years, had recently finished renovations to their home necessitated by the 2012 Christmas Day tornado. &quot;It was awful,&quot; said Lynn Yeager, who noted that she had not seen the officer before. &quot;My feeling is, they could have knocked on the door.&quot; At the time, Rains said police were not sure whether or not the suspects were armed. &quot;My husband and I both understand that they were trying to do their job,&quot; Lynn Yeager said. She said she can understand an officer reacting &quot;in the heat of the moment,&quot; but she and her husband are now worried about the safety of citizens. &quot;When you think about it, children couldve been back there,&quot; she said. &quot;We couldve been back there.&quot; She said the dogs, Alfred and Bovidea, were sleeping on the porch when Kelly walked into the backyard. She said the dogs ran up to the officer, barking as most dogs do when they don&#039;t recognize a stranger. Kelly pulled out his gun and got off two shots, one killing Alfred and a second which struck Bovidea in his ear. The investigation into the shooting is ongoing.','http://blog.al.com/live/2014/03/mobile_police_officer_who_shot.html','Alfred and Bovidea','Kevin Kelly','2','0',1,0,0,0,0,'Uniform',0,2,2,2,2,2),(1104,'2014-08-10','Texas','Cleburne','Cleburne Police Department and Cleburne Animal Services',1,2,1,'Unconfirmed Puppy 7 months old','The following is reproduced from a local ABC affiliate news report: Amanda Henderson and her husband [Quinton Tatum] have three dogs.

They&#039;d escaped from her fenced-in backyard. One was captured nearly immediately. A police report says when an officer located the other two, they were friendly at first and wagging their tails, until 7-month-old Maximus started growling and coming towards the officer. The officer then shot him. The story didn&#039;t make sense to Henderson, because she says Max was so friendly. So she requested the video from the lapel camera worn by the officer. What she saw horrified her. &quot;Never once did Max stop wagging his tail. Never once do you hear a growl, an aggressive anything,&quot; Henderson said. Cleburne police are now investigating, but say the short video clip of the dog being shot doesn&#039;t tell the whole story. &quot;The city is obviously concerned about the video showing an officer shooting a dog,&quot; said police spokeswoman Kelly Summey.

Instead the officers found Princess, an 18-month-old American Staffordshire terrier, which, they said, charged at them. They shot the animal dead. An internal departmental review later said they were justified. But now Princess&#039; owners have filed a federal lawsuit against the Seattle Police Department and the officers, alleging they had no right to shoot their beloved pet. They are demanding payment for emotional stress and mental anguish. The police won&#039;t comment specifically on the lawsuit, but they say officers have the right to protect themselves from aggressive dogs. Still, they say, dog shootings are not common given the volume of cases they handle. Seattle police have typically shot two or three dogs a year in recent years, according to internal records. A review of more than 350 Seattle police shootings since 1975 shows that officers have shot about 42 dogs or other animals in the past three decades. About half were pit bulls or breeds that police listed as pit bulls. Every animal shooting since 1975 has been ruled justified by departmental review. John and Stephanie Brace and their preschooler daughter Marissa filed suit this week in U.S. District Court in Seattle, demanding a jury trial but not specifying how much money they want. The lawsuit alleges that Officers Chris Hairston and Mike Waters overreacted by killing Princess; a witness disputes the officers&#039; accounts that the dog attacked. The suit alleges that the Police Department has &quot;reckless&quot; policies that allow officers to shoot dogs. &quot;In this case, I don&#039;t think they had a right to be on the property to begin with,&quot; said the Braces&#039; attorney, Adam Karp of Seattle, who specializes in animal-rights cases. &quot;They were illegal trespassers.&quot; Hairston and Waters were called to the beating on Southwest Holden Street in the Westwood neighborhood in January 2002. A witness said the young men had run into an apartment, which turned out to be the Braces&#039; unit. They were not home at the time. Hairston and Waters said they found the apartment door ajar and went inside to search for the attackers, reports say. When Hairston entered a bedroom, Princess ran at him, going for his legs, he told investigators. He fired once, grazing the dog. Hairston fired four more times as Princess ran toward Waters, who fired three times, dropping the dog, the police reports said. In their lawsuit, the Braces point out that the officers had no warrant and had not seen the assault suspects enter. The Braces also say Princess was not a violent dog, and they allege Waters and Hairston &quot;have a reputation&quot; for fatally shooting pit-bull dogs. Staffordshire terriers are so closely related to stockier pit-bull terriers that they are often generically called pit bulls. They also often are classified together with pit bulls as an aggressive breed. According to police records, Hairston fatally shot a pit bull in the same neighborhood in November 2001. But records show the dog had attacked a 13-year-old girl, and Hairston shot the dog after he, Waters and another officer had tried to subdue it with pepper spray and an electric stun gun. &quot;In general, officers have been forced to shoot dogs to protect themselves or to protect someone else,&quot; said police spokesman Duane Fish. &quot;We respond to hundreds of thousands of calls a year and there have been very few animals we&#039;ve had to shoot.&quot; Police also said that if they have reasonable evidence that dangerous criminals have fled into someone&#039;s home, they are allowed to chase after them to protect other people. &quot;If you&#039;re inside of a home for a legitimate purpose, it&#039;s the owner&#039;s duty to control the dog,&quot; Fish said.

Usually, however, the victims are human beings. Not so in an excessive-force case recently filed in federal court, which details the fatal shooting of a Labrador retriever mixed-breed dog named Slyder, allegedly for doing little more than sniffing the butt of a police dog. That is the picture painted by attorney Adam Karp in his lawsuit filed last week on behalf of a Grant County man named Nicholas Criscuolo. Karp is the Bellingham attorney whose relentless quest for four-legged justice we wrote about in September. According to the complaint, Criscuolo was letting his two dogs, including Slyder, have a little off-leash fun in a Moses Lake park last January when Grant County Sheriff&#039;s deputies proceeded to make a drug bust nearby. One of the deputies was Beau Lamens, who brought his police dog, Maddox, to search a car that contained some suspected meth. Slyder took off after Maddox, giving rise to the alleged butt-sniffing. The deputy kicked Slyder, according to the complaint, causing the dog to run back toward his owner--&quot;tail between his legs, not charging Lamens or Maddox or any other officer.&quot; Nevertheless, the complaint says, Lamens followed Slyder and shot the dog three times, killing him. A prior investigation conducted by the Chelan County Sheriff&#039;s Office, however, offers a different version of events. Ruling the shooting justified, the office concluded that Slyder and Maddox had been fighting, and that it seemed to Lamens as though Criscuolo&#039;s dog was returning for another round. Grant County Undersheriff Dave Ponozzo declines further comment on behalf of Lamens and his department, saying it hasn&#039;t had a chance to look at the lawsuit yet. The case allows Karp another opportunity to press his view that pets should be treated as more than mere property. Criscuolo saw Slyder as &quot;an immediate family member,&quot; the suit notes, expanding at length upon studies that document the bond people have with their pets and the grief experienced when an animal dies. Karp and his client are therefore asking not only for damages amounting to the value of Slyder but for unspecified emotional-distress damages, something the lawyer has also sought in veterinary malpractice cases. These claims are based on a variety of Constitutional arguments, including that Criscuolo was deprived of due process. Not included in the news report: Identifying information for the lawsuit is as follows: Nicholas Criscuolo v. Grant County, et al, Case No. 12-35335 Nicholas Criscuolo won his case handily. six-person federal jury in Spokane unanimously found that former Grant County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office Deputy Beau Lamens willfully killed Nicholas Criscuolo&rsquo;s dog, Slyder, without lawful justification when he shot him three times at Neppel Park in Moses Lake. As the magazine Seattle Dog Spot (http://www.seattledogspot.com/blog/dog-blog/post/landmark-decision-holds-former-grant-county-deputy-accountable-for-killing-dog-in-moses-lake) described it: This judgment in favor of Mr. Criscuolo against Grant County and Beau Lamens represents the culmination of four years of litigation that set various judicial milestones. First, Mr. Criscuolo challenged the City of Moses Lake&rsquo;s Hazardous Dog Law as unconstitutional in its categorically defining purebred and crossbred American Pit Bull Terriers, Staffordshire Bull Terriers, American Staffordshire Terriers, Rottweilers, and Presa Canarios as &ldquo;hazardous.&rdquo; On the eve of a summary judgment motion brought by Mr. Criscuolo to invalidate the law, the City repealed the Act and paid Mr. Criscuolo $14,000 in fees. As a result, Dymond and dozens of other dogs deemed &ldquo;hazardous&rdquo; in Moses Lake solely due to their appearance (not their behavior), were liberated from that adverse status. Second, the Ninth Circuit Court ruled in a unanimous decision that federal Judge Lonny Suko erred in dismissing the suit against Lamens, the former deputy who killed Slyder. Upon remand of the case from the Ninth Circuit, Judge Suko recused. Judge Thomas O. Rice then took over the case. Third, Judge Rice rejected the arguments of the defendants, Grant County and Beau Lamens, asking him to dismiss all of Mr. Criscuolo&rsquo;s state claims and to limit his damages to market value only. He also rejected their argument to immunize Lamens under RCW 16.08.030 and RCW 4.24.410. RCW 4.24.410 states that a police dog handler &ldquo;who uses a police dog in the line of duty in good faith is immune from civil action for damages arising out of such use of the police dog.&rdquo; Lamens argued that the shooting of Slyder arose from his use of the police dog. Judge Rice rejected this position, finding that the killing arose from the use of Lamens&rsquo;s Glock, not the police dog. Judge Rice&rsquo;s Feb. 10, 2014 order was the first in Washington to interpret RCW 4.24.410 where the dog handler (not the handler&rsquo;s police dog) inflicts the injury. RCW 16.08.030 provides that it &ldquo;shall be the duty of the sheriff or any deputy sheriff to kill any dog found running at large (after the first day of August of any year and before the first day of March in the following year) without a metal identification tag.&rdquo; Lamens argued that Slyder was not wearing a metal identification dog and was running at large, and for that reason only, compelled Lamens to shoot and kill Slyder. Judge Rice rejected this position as well, finding that Slyder &ldquo;was not roaming unattended or &lsquo;at large&rsquo; within the meaning of the statute,&rdquo; and that Slyder&rsquo;s rabies tag and microchip tag sufficed. Judge Rice&rsquo;s Feb. 10, 2014 order was the first in Washington to interpret RCW 16.08.030. Furthermore, Lamens argued that no reasonable jury could conclude that he maliciously injured Slyder, that he recklessly inflicted emotional distress, or that he converted Slyder. Judge Rice rejected all these arguments and allowed those claims to go to the jury. Chelan County Sheriff&#039;s Office performed the criminal investigation of the shooting, which exonerated Lamens of any criminal wrong-doing. Local media completely misrepresented the results of the jury trial. The Spokesman-Review reprinted their Sheriff&#039;s Press Release nearly word-for-word, claiming that the case was a hands-down win for the police, despite the judge rejecting claims of immunity, assigning personal liability to a police officer, and applying a law originally written for police dogs to a police human for the first time ever.','http://www.seattleweekly.com/home/936101-129/animals','Slyder','Beau Lamens and Kevin Dobson','2','0',0,0,0,0,2,'Uniform',3,3,0,0,1,0),(1113,'2014-10-22','Texas','Corpus Christi','Corpus Christi Police Department, Corpus Christi Animal Care Services and Vector Control',1,2,1,'Unconfirmed','The following is reproduced from a local WorldNow news affiliate: A Corpus Christi police officer was forced to shoot a full-breed bluenose pit bull in the 2600 block of Brawner Parkway, near Devon, after noticing that the dog had chased a man and pinned him on top of an electrical box just after 9 a.m. Wednesday.

The CDC statistics cited in the report are wrong: The Forsyth County District Attorney&rsquo;s office has determined that Acting Police Chief Barry Rountree&rsquo;s use of lethal force was justified in Wednesday&rsquo;s shooting in an incident on Jackson Avenue in which a woman and her dog were wounded. The State Bureau of Investigation determined that Rountree &ldquo;acted to protect himself and to protect the lives of others,&rdquo; the district attorney&rsquo;s office said in a statement Friday. The SBI findings clear the way for Rountree to be sworn as Winston-Salem&rsquo;s next police chief Sunday at City Hall. The SBI interviewed officers and witnesses and then met with District Attorney Jim O&rsquo;Neill to discuss the case. O&rsquo;Neill declined to comment on the case. Derwin Montgomery, a member of the Winston-Salem City Council, represents the East Ward where the shooting occurred. Montgomery said he supports Rountree. &ldquo;I believe his actions were justified,&rdquo; Montgomery said. The shooting occurred after Winston-Salem police received a 911 call that a man armed with a two-barreled gun was standing on a porch at 124 N. Jackson Ave. and pointing the gun at someone, police said. As of Friday, no arrests had been made in connection with the report of an armed man. Officer Mohammed Khan arrived on the scene, and Rountree responded to assist him, police said. Khan and Rountree then took cover behind Khan&rsquo;s vehicle. Before they could search for the man, Assistant Chief David Clayton said, a medium-sized boxer or boxer-mix dog ran from behind a house at 114 N. Jackson Ave. toward Rountree and Khan. Clayton said the dog charged Rountree, who fired a bullet from his service handgun at the dog. The bullet apparently hit the dog, then struck the driveway&rsquo;s pavement and ricocheted. Bullet fragments struck the homeowner, Tamara Whitt, in her upper left leg. Whitt said that her dog, LeBron, wasn&rsquo;t actively aggressively toward Rountree and the other officer. Rountree was placed on administrative duty until the SBI completed its investigation. Since 2011, Forsyth County has had 806 cases of pet animals biting people, said Tim Jennings, the director of Forsyth County Animal Control. Most cases involve dogs, but cats also bite humans, he said. Over the past 48 years, there have been 30 dog bite-related fatalities in North Carolina, according to the National Canine Research Council, which monitors human-canine relations in the country. About 4.5 million people are bitten by dogs each year, according to statistics complied by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. An animal-rights advocacy group recommends that police officers use caution in dealing with dogs when they respond on emergency calls. &ldquo;The more police officers are familiar with dogs, the less likely they will drawn their weapons and fire,&rdquo; said Donald Cleary, a spokesman for the National Canine Research Council in Amenia, N.Y. &ldquo;The goal is to keep the officer, the dog and civilians safe.&rdquo; Not mentioned in the article: Police seized the animal and placed it under &quot;quarantine&quot; in the  Forsyth County Animal Shelter.

I feared for the safety of both myself and the animal control officer.&rdquo; &ldquo;I drew my department issued firearm,&rdquo; it continued, &ldquo;and shot the canine once in the chest. The dog dropped to the ground and began crying.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s believed that Shiva, Hixson&rsquo;s roommate&rsquo;s boxer, then ran away and into the street, where its foot was run over by a car. Both dogs were taken to an animal hospital, the officer wrote. The bullet that struck Kira went into her chest and out of her front shoulder, missing her vital organs. She is expected to survive. Hixson, though, is distraught. She said she&rsquo;s received multiple conflicting stories about what happened that day &mdash; and said that, if anyone should know how to handle such a situation without having to shoot a dog, it&rsquo;s animal control officers. &ldquo;I want to know what really happened, because I know she&rsquo;s not a vicious dog,&rdquo; Hixson said. &ldquo;Everything they say in the report is very contrary to her normal character. It just doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Police shouldn&rsquo;t just shoot dogs,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;It just shouldn&rsquo;t happen.

The report is based entirely on the reports of police despite a multitude of alternate witnesses and defendants (at least five of which were children). The killing occurred during the arrest of a number of teenagers for marijuana and one teenager for weapons possession. The dog and the dogs owner was completely unrelated to the children who were arrested. : Lebanon police charged several unidentified suspects with various drug and weapons charges Friday night after an officer patrolling a gate at the Wilson County Fair reported gunfire on Tennessee Boulevard. A Lebanon Public Safety officer also shot a dog during a search for the shooters. Officer Tim Kelley heard at least two shots fired in the area while patrolling at the Tennessee Boulevard gate at the fair Friday night, according to police reports. Kelley left his post and walked to Tennessee Boulevard, where he saw people scatter and point north. Kelley then called for additional officers and started a search of the area. He found the unidentified victim, who said he didn&rsquo;t know why someone was shooting at him. At that point, Officer Jeff Scott responded and said he saw a suspicious group of men in the area. Scott interviewed the suspects and found two bags of white powder, which police believe was cocaine, on the ground at their feet. Officer J.P. Tuggle responded with his drug dog Rush. Tuggle took Rush to the car the group was standing around. Rush then alerted officers to the presence of drugs in the car, and officers found about &frac12; ounces of marijuana, pre-rolled joints and hash oil during a search. During an interview with the suspects, officers said the suspects told them four other suspicious men were in the car behind them on the opposite side of the street. The suspects told officers the suspicious men ran to the car after the shooting. Officers went to the car and found fogged windows and four men leaning over in the seats hiding. After they got out of the car, a gun was found in plain view in the back seat. Officers found two other guns, including one reported stolen from Smith County, along with a small amount of marijuana during a search of the car. Officers did a follow-up interview with the victim in front of the suspects, but he failed to identify who shot at him. &ldquo;The reason that we have officers working the gates is to identify any problems like these in hopes of keeping them outside of the fairgrounds,&rdquo; police Chief Scott Bowen said. &ldquo;In this case it worked perfectly. Field Training Officer Kelley reacted very quickly in identifying a dangerous situation, and our officers responded appropriately. After interviewing the victim we believe he knows more about the incident than he is willing to share. Our No. 1 priority is the safety of our fairgoers. We do not believe that this incident is connected to the fair in any way. It just happened to occur on Tennessee Boulevard.&rdquo; All of the adult suspects were booked in at the Wilson County Jail just before midnight. James Dylan Craighead, 19, of Watertown, was charged with possession or manufacture of drugs with intent for resale. Bond for Craighead was set at $3,000. Devin Allen Lee Olinger, 18, of Lebanon, was charged with possession or manufacture of drugs with intent for resale. Bond for Olinger was set at $3,000. Javonte Desheun Richardson, 18, of Lebanon, was charged with three counts of possession or manufacture of drugs with intent for resale. Bond for Richardson was set at $3,000. Cortavious Deshawn Sydnor, 20, of Lebanon, was charged with possession or manufacture of drugs with intent for resale. Bond was set at $3,000. Christopher Lamar Robinson, 18, of Lebanon, was charged with theft of property and unlawful carry and possession of a weapon. Bond was set at $14,000. Shawn Davon Jones, 19, of Lebanon, was charged with unlawful carry and possession of a weapon. Bond was set at $3,500. Each of the suspects remained in jail Saturday, and each has an Oct. 21 court date. Five suspects under 18 were taken to Lebanon Police Department. Youth services officers decided to release the underage suspects to their parents, and juvenile petitions would be issued Monday. &ldquo;It&#039;s very disturbing the number of young people that were involved in this incident,&rdquo; Bowen said. During a search for the shooters, Lebanon Public Safety officers were sent to different areas around the fairgrounds to look for suspects to avoid suspects&rsquo; attempts to enter the fair to try and escape. Public Safety officer Thomas Douglas was sent to an area around the Wilson County Health Department, which is used to house fair employees during the fair. While there, Douglas ran into a dog running loose. Douglas said in the police report the dog growled at him when he passed the dog the first time. Douglas came in contact with the dog a second time during his search. He said this time the dog growled, showed his teeth and came toward him. Douglas said he stopped, and the dog stopped and eventually turned away. Douglas said he saw two suspicious men walking around the health department, and his attention was on the men when he heard grass rustling behind him. Douglas said he turned to see the same dog charging him. He said the dog showed his teeth, his hair was raised and his tail was straight. Douglas backpedaled away from the dog but came upon a fence that blocked his path. Douglas said the dog continued to run at him, so he drew his gun and shot the dog once with a single shot. Lebanon animal control officers were called to the scene and found the dog still alive. The dog&rsquo;s owner, a fair vendor from North Carolina, also arrived. The dog&rsquo;s owner and Public Safety Officer David Bryant administered first aid on the dog. The dog was taken to a local veterinarian, and the owner went with him. The dog was later taken to an animal hospital in Murfreesboro. &ldquo;The officer&rsquo;s intent was to get back to his golf cart and leave,&rdquo; said Public Safety Director Mike Justice. &ldquo;When he got to within about 75 feet of the golf cart the dog got between him and the golf cart.&rdquo; Justice said the dog appeared to be a blue healer mix. &ldquo;As I understand it at about noon today, the dog was still alive but was in serious condition,&rdquo; said Public Safety Director Mike Justice. &ldquo;As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, it is unfortunate, but the officer gave every option to get away from the dog. If he would have had any other option, I&rsquo;m sure he wouldn&rsquo;t have shot the dog.&rdquo;','http://www.lebanondemocrat.com/article/crime/453331','Unknown','Public Safety Officer David Bryant - shooter, Police Tim Kelley, Jeff Scott, J.P.

The article is based entirely on uncorroborated police statements: A Memphis police officer was shot and critically injured Thursday afternoon by a second officer who was aiming at a dog, officials said Thursday afternoon. Willie Bryant, a 32-year-old member of the Organized Crime Unit, was taken to the Regional Medical Center at Memphis in stable condition, but was later downgraded to critical. He was taken into surgery Thursday afternoon, Memphis Police Department Director Toney Armstrong said. The incident began about 12:45 p.m. at 589 Arrington near Thomas in North Memphis. A multi-jurisdictional gang unit task force was serving a warrant at that location. When police entered the home, two dogs &mdash; a pit bull and a Cane Corso &mdash; were inside, according to James Rogers administrator Memphis Animal Services. The Corso was loose and the pit bull was in a kennel. According to police, the loose dog charged, leading the officer to fire his weapon. The shot missed the dog and hit Bryant &mdash; who was wearing a protective vest &mdash; in the back. Bryant, who has been on the force for nine years, was rushed by ambulance to The Med, accompanied by a police escort. Officers blocked off city streets for the ambulance, then swarmed The Med in a show of support. Police cordoned off the area surrounding Arrington at Danny Thomas, where more than two dozen MPD units responded. Officers directed motorists around the scene as a cluster of investigators gathered outside the house in an empty lot. Across the street on Thomas, groups of neighbors and other bystanders watched as MPD personnel and news crews surveyed the area. Animal control found two more Cane Corsos in the backyard, as well as a dozen fish inside the house. Memphis Animal Services took all four dogs. Police released no other details about the incident, including the name, age or length of service of the officer who shot Bryant. They also did not say whether there were any people in the home, but no one else was injured. The last shooting that wounded a police officer came in April, when an officer and a carjacking suspect shot each other after a brief struggle near Raleigh. That officer, 30-year-old Josh Shearer, was wearing a protective vest and wasn&#039;t seriously injured. On July 3, 2011, MPD officer Tim Warren was shot and killed in a Downtown hotel. Alexander Haydel was charged with first-degree murder in the death of Warren, 39, and another man in that incident. A followup story leaked the shooters name as Byron Willis, who joined MPD in July 2007: http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/local-news/wounded-memphis-police-officer-is-iraq-war-still - Disciplinary records for Willis are as follows: Willis was suspended for one day in March 2010 after striking another vehicle with his squad car for the second time that year. In that accident, he rolled into a parked vehicle in a private driveway after forgetting to engage his parking brake. In the other accident, he struck the rear of a fellow officer&#039;s squad car while the two were responding to a call. Minor damage occurred in each collision, and no injuries were reported. Willis was among the OCU officers involved in the February raid of a Memphis lingerie party in which six juveniles and 10 adults &mdash; including a registered sex offender &mdash; were arrested. He was given a written reprimand in the incident after a witness recorded him grabbing a 16-year-old suspect by the neck and throwing the boy against a vehicle. The video was posted to YouTube, but has since been removed.\r\n\r\nTwo men were arrested inside the home. Lazarus Johnson, 33, and Charles Cross, 37, are charged with possession of cocaine, marijuana and a firearm with intent to commit a felony. Cross also is charged with resisting official detention. Johnson was held on $40,000 bond. Cross made his $90,000 bond and was released.','http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/local-news/memphis-police-officer-shot-north-memphis','Unknown','Byron Willis - shooter, Willie Bryant - injured by friendly fire','1','2',2,0,1,1,1,'Uniform',1,2,1,0,0,0),(1121,'2013-03-05','Tennessee','Memphis','Memphis Police Department Organized Crime Unit',3,2,1,'Unconfirmed','The following news report is reproduced from a local Nexstar Broadcasting affiliate.

The details of the incident were strangely similar to the first, involving drugs, dogs and guns. It happened about 3:30 in the afternoon; several officers attempting to serve a drug warrant were attacked by pit bulls. The officer left outside was the one who took the friendly fire. &quot;All search warrants are dangerous,&quot; said Memphis Police Director Toney Armstrong, &quot;no matter what the circumstances are.&quot; 45-year-old MPD officer Calvin Taylor found that out the hard way, while helping serve a drug warrant at 4047 Berkshire in the Nutbush area. &ldquo;His assignment while executing the search warrant was to secure the perimeter of the residence,&rdquo; Armstrong told abc24.com. When other officers went inside, investigators say they were attacked by three pit bulls and opened fire with a shotgun. &ldquo;Several pellets penetrated a door, striking him in the leg,&rdquo; Armstrong said. Officer Taylor was taken to The MED in non-critical condition, but neighbors were shaken up. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s crazy,&rdquo; said Kayla Moore, &ldquo;we shouldn&rsquo;t have to deal with this, kids are out here all day long.&rdquo; While the wounded officer was shocking, drug activity in the neighborhood came as no surprise. &ldquo;There are drugs all around,&rdquo; said Moore, &ldquo;you really can&rsquo;t avoid them.&rdquo; &ldquo;We&rsquo;re just grateful that he&rsquo;s going to be okay,&rdquo; said Armstrong, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s upbeat; never lost consciousness, knows exactly what&rsquo;s going on. He does not appear to be in a terrible amount of pain.&rdquo; This was the second time in six months an MPD officer was hit by friendly fire. In November 2012, Officer Willie Bryant was shot by fellow officer Byron Willis while serving a drug warrant. Willis was aiming for a dog on the attack. &ldquo;You never know what you are going on face on the other side of the door,&rdquo; said Armstrong, &ldquo;whether it is an armed suspect, or some dogs trained to attack you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Nobody has any self respect for anything, anymore.&rdquo; commented Moore on the entire situation. Officer Taylor has been with the MPD since 1998, and on the Organized Crime Unit since 2011. Several suspects were arrested on the scene; charges are pending.

Terron Siggers had called them after he got in a heated argument with his mother at her house. Police reports indicate they tried to calm him down, but Siggers continued cursing and yelling. The affidavit stated that Siggers had taken a door knob off the door to trap police in the house. But the MPD incident report does not mention that, only saying the officers were chased by the pit bull when it was released on them. The Siggers family tells a very different story. They said Terron Siggers had calmed down, and that their puppy, just shy of six months old, came out the front door. They said &ldquo;Spider,&rdquo; otherwise known as &ldquo;Fat Puppy,&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t bark or chase anyone. Police reports do not state that the dog injured anyone, but police did draw their weapons on the dog. Memphis police then called Memphis Animal Services to pick up the dog. Terron Siggers was taken to 201 Poplar, charged with disorderly conduct and aggravated assault. That week, Siggers&rsquo; wife called the animal shelter to get their puppy back. &ldquo;I was told we needed $200 and then $15 for every day the dog was there,&rdquo; said Kerah Siggers. They also warned of other charges should the dog have any diseases they would need to treat. Siggers said she didn&rsquo;t have the money for that. The day before Thanksgiving, she called again. &ldquo;At that point in time, they couldn&rsquo;t give us any information on the dog. They couldn&rsquo;t tell us anything, even though I had been in contact with them several times before that.&rdquo; On Nov. 28, the family finally found out &ldquo;Fat Puppy&rdquo; was euthanized on Nov. 14. The city of Memphis released a statement, saying &ldquo;shelter staff made every attempt to reconnect the pit bull with the owner.&rdquo; A city spokesperson also said that the shelter staff informed the family that the dog would be put down. While there&rsquo;s debate over the dog, there&rsquo;s also debate over the actual incident leading up to the dog being taken from the home in the first place. Terron Siggers&rsquo; mother, Gladys Williams, said that her son has been in trouble before. She has generally confronted him whenever he has done wrong, but this time, she said she&rsquo;s lost faith in police. &ldquo;The statements they made were false, they were never trapped inside the house, they were never chased down the street,&rdquo; Williams said.

The article follows: A police officer shot and killed what was described as a &ldquo;vicious&rdquo; pit bull that charged at him shortly after noon Sunday. The incident occurred while the officer was investigating a dog-at-large complaint in the area of 18th Street and Antoine. Upon arriving to the area, a man flagged down the officer and yelled out &ldquo;Are you lookin&rsquo; for a brown pit bull?&rdquo; The officer replied that he was, so the man informed him that the dog ran south in the city alley between 18th and 19th streets, just south of Antoine. As the officer turned off Antoine and into the alley, he saw a large tan and white pit bull along a yard&rsquo;s cyclone fence, highly agitated and barking at dogs contained within the yard. The officer radioed other patrol cars of the dog&rsquo;s whereabouts as he exited his patrol vehicle. &ldquo;The vicious pit bull charged directly at me,&rdquo; the officer stated in his report. &ldquo;While the dog was about 8 feet away from me, I discharged my firearm and dispatched the dog.&rdquo; The officer notified dispatchers and other units that shots were fired and the dog was down. A few minutes later, an 18th Street resident appeared in her backyard, looking in to the alley. The officer asked if she knew where the dog belonged. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s mine officer,&rdquo; the woman replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, it gets out all the time.&rdquo; The officer told her the dog charged him and was subsequently put down. The woman told the officer the dog was not licensed or registered with the city. He then pointed to another dog in her yard, a dog she said also was not licensed. The woman apologized, saying that the dog was very protective, but &ldquo;fine&rdquo; with her family. An animal control officer said he would follow up with violations for dog at large, vicious dog, unlicensed dog and no shot records. Police Chief Daniel Grant said his department has received some calls about this incident, but there is no indication that the officer acted improperly. &ldquo;If a dog is charging an officer they do not have to wait for it to grab a hold of them or bite prior to discharging a firearm,&rdquo; Grant said. &ldquo;They would also take into account the size of the dog, what the dog was doing prior to the encounter, and if it is taking an aggressive action.&rdquo;','http://www.thenewsherald.com/articles/2014/10/07/news/doc54344d614dce9881660118.txt?viewmode=fullstory','Buster','Steve Sabo','1','0',2,0,0,2,1,'Uniform',3,3,0,0,2,0),(1126,'2014-04-25','New York','Buffalo','Buffalo Police Department',1,50,0,'Boxer 13yo','The following is reproduced from an AP story, with the source linked to a Fox News affiliate from Detroit: Police have seized 20 dogs and shot one during dogfighting raids in the Buffalo area.

When police stormed the house on Indian Church Road, near Seneca Street, at about 5:30 p.m. Saturday, Daniel Patterson was on the couch, watching the news. &quot;They shot the dogs for no reason at all,&quot; he told The Buffalo News on Sunday. Rita Patterson said she was cooking dinner in the kitchen when she heard loud noises at the side door. Hanavan was upstairs taking a nap, and at first she thought he may have fallen out of bed. Before she knew what was happening, police wearing masks and helmets and carrying automatic weapons had broken through the door. They tied her hands with a zip tie and put her on the floor. Her father pleaded with police not to shoot the dogs, but they wouldn&#039;t allow him to grab the dogs and put them in another room, Patterson said. One of the officers started firing a shotgun at the two dogs, one a pit bull and the other a pit bull-boxer mix. One of the dogs was shot three times: once in the throat, once in the back and the last time in the leg while trying to run away, Rita Patterson said. The other dog was cowering behind a table. Neither was a threat to the police, the residents said. The police had a warrant for the home, but it named no suspects. It said only that investigators were looking for a white male and Hydrocodone. Information that led to the warrant, according to the warrant itself, came partly from an informant, Rita Patterson said. Hanavan was paroled in February 2008 after he served more than eight months of a one- to three-year sentence for fifth-degree criminal possession of a controlled substance, a Class D felony. Hanavan was arrested Sunday following an assault at about 3:30 p.m. on Indian Church Road near the site of the raid. Hanavan and a second suspect are accused of pinning down a man and punching and kicking him repeatedly, said Buffalo police spokesman Michael J. DeGeorge. The man suffered numerous injuries and was taken to Mercy Hospital. It&#039;s not known how or if the incident is connected to the previous day&#039;s raid, DeGeorge said. Police did have a warrant for the address, DeGeorge said, though he would not comment on who the target may have been or what police were looking for. &quot;It&#039;s part of an ongoing undercover operation,&quot; DeGeorge said. Rita Patterson said she will be talking with a lawyer today. &quot;There&#039;s not even a word to describe the pain I feel,&quot; she said. DeGeorge, the police spokesman, said the Pattersons have a right to request an investigation through the department&#039;s Professional Standards Division. DeGeorge did point to the inherent danger police generally face when raiding a home. &quot;Executing a search warrant, police never know what they&#039;re going to find on the other side of that door,&quot; DeGeorge said. &quot;In most cases, these can be life and death situations.&quot;','http://buffalonews.com/article/20090330/CITYANDREGION/303309987','Essy and Moosey','Unknown SWAT team','2','0',2,0,0,0,2,'Uniform',1,2,2,2,2,0),(1128,'2009-08-12','California','Los Angeles','Drug Enforcement Administration, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Internal Revenue Service, Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department, Los Angeles Police Department, Torrance Police Department and Culver City Police Department ',1,2,1,'Unconfirmed','The following is reproduced from the LA Times: Federal authorities and local police agencies today raided two Westside marijuana dispensaries as well as the residence of the owners.

Two weeks ago, the gate to her backyard in Sun Valley, Calif. was somehow left open, and her dogs got out. The dogs, being dogs, enjoyed the freedom of not being &ldquo;gated&rdquo; but quickly came back to their home. Cabrera&rsquo;s 4-year-old mixed Pit bull Drake, probably should have stayed away. Drake was shot in the head by the LAPD before his owners even knew the gate was open. A neighbor must have called the police about the dogs being outside. The LAPD never attempted to contact Cabrera, who was right inside the house watching her 16-month-old daughter. According to the police, when they found the dogs on Cabrera&rsquo;s property, one of the dogs &ldquo;ran away&rdquo; from the approaching LAPD. Drake, who had been playing with Cabrera&rsquo;s daughter since she was an infant, &ldquo;walked&rdquo; towards the police. There was no mention of Drake acting aggressively, barking, or even growling, just &ldquo;walking&rdquo;. The &ldquo;walking&rdquo; was apparently too much for the two officers, and one of them shot Drake in the eye, most likely expecting the dog to be killed. Edwin Ayala, Cabrera&rsquo;s husband, was just coming home from work. He pulled into his driveway to the sound of gunshots and saw two police officers in the back driveway. &ldquo;He was three seconds too late,&rdquo; Cabrera told the Examiner. Cabrera rushed Drake to the veterinarian, and they were able to save his life, at a cost. Cabrera described the wounds on GoFundMe, a crowdsourcing website she&rsquo;s using to try to pay the thousands of dollars it will cost to keep Drake alive. &ldquo;Our dog has suffered severe trauma to his head and eye, and will now be disabled for the remainder of his life. The vet had to remove his eye, which was completely ruptured, he has brain damage and shattered bones all in his face. His nasal cavity has also been destroyed. The vet could not believe the damage that this all did, she said if it happened to a human we would be dead because the impact was so hard it destroyed all the muscles and nerves in his face.&rdquo; Cabrera does not understand why the LAPD didn&rsquo;t approach the situation differently. The two officers never knocked on her door, or let her know they were there. &ldquo;They could have approached him in a friendly manner,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t have to shot him.&rdquo; Cabrera, who is six months pregnant, explained that Drake is currently doing well. His stitches were just taken out, although he&rsquo;ll never look the same. &ldquo;It is disgusting and so wrong that this happened to him,&rdquo; she said on her fundraising page. Her pictures of Drake were taken down from the site, they were considered &ldquo;too gruesome&rdquo;. Drake will probably never understand why he came so close to death, but Cabrera doesn&rsquo;t understand why it happened either. Cabrera asked for help on GoFundMe, &ldquo;We are asking for help in guidance with this unfortunate event, we don&#039;t know what direction to take as far as receiving help for these crazy vet bills or with filing against LAPD for the brutal force used against our dog.&rdquo; Additional Note: The GoFundMe Site mentioned in this article has been completely removed. Puppycide Database Project is attempting to discover why that occurred, particularly in light of previous complaints by GoFundMe that the picture of Drake after having been shot in the face by police were &quot;too gruesome&quot; for their site.','http://www.examiner.com/article/police-shoot-pregnant-mother-s-dog-her-own-driveway','Drake','Two Unknown Police','0','1',1,0,0,0,2,'Uniform',0,2,2,2,2,2),(1132,'2012-10-27','Alaska','Desert Hot Springs','Desert Hot Springs Police Department',1,2,1,'Unconfirmed','Miguel Preciado, a Desert Hot Springs officer killed a supposedly aggressive dog in October 2012, and then shot and killed a suspected car thief in August 2013.

This behavior is consistent with behavior the Puppycide Database Project has noted - local media outlets routinely self-censor their own coverage, removing stories of police shootings shortly after initial publication: A game warden shot and killed a dog that was harassing elk Saturday on the upper North Fork. &quot;It&#039;s my fault and my responsibility,&quot; said Mike Neff, operations manager at Sleeping Giant Ski Area. His two-year-old female heeler/shepherd mix, &quot;Bama,&quot; was shot by warden Craig Sax. Dogs must be kept under control in the national forest. Neff said he let his two dogs out of his cabin at Shoshone Lodge early that morning, and they ran off. He could not find either and had to go to work at the ski area across the highway. Later, Sax came across Bama barking and harassing an elk along the river about two miles east of the ski area and shot it, Neff said. &quot;I don&#039;t blame anyone but myself,&quot; he added. &quot;The dog was not under my control.&quot; He said Sax came to the ski area and explained what had happened and wrote him a warning ticket. G&amp;F regional wildlife supervisor Brian Nesvik said Monday cases where dogs have to be shot at or removed are rare. &quot;It&#039;s one of the worst things we have to do,&quot; he said. State statute allows any peace officer to remove a dog that is harassing wildlife, although Nesvik said it&#039;s only done as an &quot;absolute last resort.&quot; He said that while there are numerous calls about a dog harassing wildlife, most often they are resolved by the time a warden can get there. &quot;In this case, the elk were held at bay by two dogs for more than four hours,&quot; he said. G&amp;F received multiple reports from drivers who saw the incident from the highway. Although when Sax arrived there was one elk, several reports stated there were two at one time, Nesvik said. The second dog ran off after the first was removed, he added. &quot;It&#039;s a rare situation,&quot; he said. &quot;In my career of 15 years, I&#039;ve only had two situations where I&#039;ve had to shoot or shoot at a dog.&quot; Not mentioned in the article: Note that Craig Sax mentions that he killed one or perhaps two additional dogs in his capacity as a game warden.

Police scanner reports indicate that about noon Saturday a man in the 4000 block of Victory Avenue was threatening neighbors with a knife after chasing someone walking a dog. When officers arrived, the man refused to come out of the house and a perimeter was established. The scene remained an active tactical situation for several hours. Racine Police Chief Art Howell said the man made threats against police, including shooting them with a cross bow, and those comments prompted the tactical response. Police blocked off the area and residents were advised to stay in their homes. For reasons unknown, the man let his dog out of the house. Witnesses told Racine County Eye the dog walked toward officers but turned around to go back to the house, and that is when it was shot by police. After shooting the dog police stormed the house and took the man into custody. Howell said he was not prepared to comment on the situation further until he spoke with his officers and supervisors on duty. We will update this story as more details become available.

According to a police scanner report, callers said things like &quot;I am trapped in my car because two vicious dogs are outside&quot;, &quot;The dogs just knocked over an elderly man&quot;, and &quot;The dogs are chasing my son&quot;. The owner of the dogs, Rick Maddox, was out of town when his pets Betty Boop and Dozer left his home through their doggie door. He said they have always stayed on his property and never attacked anyone before. After CPD officers arrived on scene, they tracked the dogs back to Maddox&#039;s property. Sgt. Paul Perdue with the Charleston Police Department said the officers on scene were trapped in their car by the dogs, so they called for backup. When the second cruiser arrived the dogs ran up to it, giving the other officers a chance to exit their vehicle. Additionally, Sgt. Perdue said the dogs then turned around and tried attacking both officers. He said his fellow officers had no choice but to shoot and kill both dogs. &quot;I would never ask someone to put their life on the line to keep from getting bit by a dog&quot; said Sgt. Perdue. After being shot, Betty Boop jumped into the police cruiser and died, Dozer ran back into Maddox&#039;s home where police say they entered through an unlocked door. Sgt. Perdue said Dozer lost a lot of blood, so they called a humane officer to the scene to euthanize him. Rick Maddox still can&#039;t believe that his dogs were capable of terrorizing and entire neighborhood. &quot;They were both very friendly dogs...they knew no stranger. There wasn&#039;t a vicious bone in either dog&quot; says Maddox. Maddox said he got the news about his pets from his father after police stopped by his house. When Maddox returned home, he found blood all over his drive way and on the couch downstairs where Dozer was euthanized. He was told that the dogs bodies were collected by a humane officer, but when he called to get them he was told that they had already been destroyed.

The story describes how a police officer shot a labrador in front of a two year old child, and how the police officer was cleared of any wrongdoing by a so-called &quot;review panel&quot; composed of members of the police department that employs the shooter and a pair of police chiefs from neighboring police departments. Multiple witnesses agree the officer fired immediately after pulling his gone and without providing the dog with an opportunity to respond to verbal commands. Witnesses further specify the dog was not dangerous, and even the shooter confirms that not only did the dog not bite anyone, but he did not even growl, bark or bear his teeth: A Woodville K-9 officer who on Monday shot a loose dog that approached the scene of a traffic stop has been cleared of wrongdoing, though witnesses to the incident have not yet been interviewed and the investigation is continuing. Officer Steve Gilkerson stopped a vehicle in front of Lockport Transportation at 875 E. Main St. for speeding at about 11:30 a.m. Police said a loose chocolate Labrador retriever ran directly at the officer, who was backing away, and the dog did not stop or change course when yelled at twice. &ldquo;The officer, in fear for his safety and the safety of the two subjects who had exited their car, fired one round from his department-issued weapon, striking the dog thereby ending the threat,&rdquo; police Chief Roy Whitehead said in a statement issued Tuesday afternoon. The Lab, named Moses, was struck in the right foreleg. Officer Gilkerson has been with the department for more than eight years, and has been a K-9 handler since February, 2013. He could not be reached by The Blade for comment. Moses&rsquo; owner, Lauren Bischoff, of Woodville, works at Lockport Transportation and often brings the 5-year-old family dog with her. The dog greets trucks and other vehicles that enter the front gate, and Mrs. Bischoff said he likely went to greet the people at the traffic stop in the same manner because the vehicles were parked on the business&rsquo; side of the road. Mrs. Bischoff did not witness the incident, but said Officer Gilkerson told her Moses was not growling, barking, or acting aggressively in any manner. &ldquo;He said it wasn&rsquo;t enough evidence to tell him [Moses] wasn&rsquo;t going to attack him or bite him,&rdquo; Mrs. Bischoff said. Moses is being treated at West Suburban Animal Hospital in Sylvania Township and will undergo surgery today to place rods and pins in his leg. &ldquo;The bullet shattered the two main bones in the forearm, and he had a fair bit of blood loss,&rdquo; veterinarian Gary Thompson said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to have a lot of hardware. It&rsquo;s a mess.&rdquo; Dr. Thompson said Moses should make a full recovery and has been a friendly and cooperative patient. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s wagging his tail and he&rsquo;s happy,&rdquo; he said. Robin Cook of Clyde was driving the vehicle that had been pulled over, and she consented to a search at the request of Officer Gilkerson. She and her boyfriend exited the car, leaving her 2-year-old daughter inside. She said Moses walked up to the scene with his tail wagging, sniffing the ground and her car tire. She said the officer pulled his weapon and pointed it at Moses, then yelled. She said the dog looked up only after being yelled at. The officer &ldquo;just shot and didn&#039;t give the dog a chance to do anything,&rdquo; Ms. Cook said, estimating it was 6 or 7 seconds from the time the officer pulled his gun to the time he fired. &ldquo;I was in shock.&rdquo; Ms. Cook said Officer Gilkerson went back to his cruiser for about a minute, then returned and told the couple he would not search the vehicle. &ldquo;He told us to leave,&rdquo; she said, saying they stayed awhile because she was too emotional to drive. Her daughter also witnessed the event, and was talking about the dog being shot, bleeding, and needing to see a doctor. &ldquo;She talked about it all day [Monday],&rdquo; Ms. Cook said. &ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t want her to be traumatized. She loves animals. She was white and was breathing heavy, like she was scared and didn&#039;t know what to do.&rdquo; Joni Kryspin, an employee at Lockport Transportation, had been outside taking a smoke break when she saw Moses wandering up to the scene. She called him and was walking up to get him when he was shot, though her view of the incident itself was blocked by the vehicles. &ldquo;I was pretty hysterical,&rdquo; Mrs. Kryspin said. &ldquo;He loves people. He wasn&#039;t threatening.&rdquo; Chief Whitehead said he convened a review panel consisting of himself and a sergeant who is the firearms instructor for the Woodville Police Department, as well as the chiefs of the Clyde, Gibsonburg, and Elmore police departments. The panel spoke with Officer Gilkerson; Mrs. Bischoff&rsquo;s husband, Tom; and the dog wardens from Ottawa and Sandusky counties before determining the officer did not violate department policy or state law. &ldquo;Officer Gilkerson has a tremendous love for animals,&rdquo; Chief Whitehead said. &ldquo;At no point in our careers as officers do we hope to pull a firearm and have to shoot anyone or anything. I hope people take into consideration that this is unfortunate for everybody involved, but it was a decision that officer had to make within a split second.&rdquo; In April, 2013, Officer Gilkerson and his then-new K-9 partner, Raider, greeted members of the public. In response to a question, he told the crowd, &ldquo;I have been afraid of dogs my whole life that I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m comfortable with dogs I do know.&rdquo; Chief Whitehead said the officers do not receive training in how to deal with dogs they come across during the course of their duties. He said Officer Gilkerson has undergone extensive training with Raider and several other area K-9 units and has never shown any fear. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s a valid statement to bring up two years later with the extensive amount of training he&rsquo;s received,&rdquo; the chief said. &ldquo;We deal with dogs on a weekly basis, and Officer Gilkerson has handled, I&rsquo;m sure, several of those cases. And luckily, we&#039;ve never had to harm any animals. Therefore, I can&rsquo;t see that being a valid statement that he shouldn&#039;t have a K-9 based on how he felt as a child.&rdquo; Mrs. Bischoff said the entire incident &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t make sense.&rdquo; &ldquo;There is no reason this should have happened,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We just don&rsquo;t understand why [Officer Gilkerson] was so quick to use a gun. Cops are supposed to have pepper spray or Tasers. He was too quick to draw for his gun.&rdquo; Mrs. Bischoff said she would like Officer Gilkerson to take responsibility for his actions and be formally disciplined. She also wants the department to receive training in dealing with dogs and would like to be compensated for the cost of Moses&rsquo; care.

The article fails to mention that this is the second animal that the shooter, Anthony Redmond, has attacked with deadly force in the last 90 days. Before this killing, Redmond shot a Labrador named Jake in Medway on August 9th, 2014. The prior shooting is event ID 119 in the Puppycide Database: Police warned residents to avoid coyotes Thursday after an officer was forced to shoot one near McDonald&rsquo;s earlier this week. Coyotes and many other wild animals have lived on and near the paper mill property on Katahdin Avenue and in nearby woods for many years, police and Lincoln Paper and Tissue LLC paper mill officials said. The large mill parcel, adjoining wetlands and Lincoln&rsquo;s rural character even within its West Broadway business strip have made them a common sight. But within the last week at least three reports to police have indicated that the coyotes are coming onto people&rsquo;s properties and aren&rsquo;t shying away from people, Lincoln&rsquo;s public safety director Dan Summers said. &ldquo;It looks like we have a bunch of coyotes running around. It&rsquo;s the first time in my career that we have had so many complaints in residential and business areas,&rdquo; Summers said Thursday. &ldquo;Not only do we have problems with bears, we have them with coyotes.&rdquo; &ldquo;We are hearing they are not afraid of human beings or scared,&rdquo; Summers added. Officer Anthony Redmond shot and killed a coyote near McDonald&rsquo;s on Tuesday night. Several sightings also have been reported on Katahdin Avenue near the mill and on Evergreen Drive between Lee Road and Main Street, Summer said. One Katahdin Avenue resident complained that a coyote or dog had eaten several of her chickens, Summers said. Lincoln Town Council Chairman Steve Clay said that he followed a coyote from Main Street near Whitney Energy onto Depot Street near the mill Monday night before grazing it slightly with his truck. Councilor Curt Ring was with him. They had just left a council meeting, Clay said. &ldquo;On Depot Street I saw what I thought was a dog at first,&rdquo; Clay said. &ldquo;Both of us said that&rsquo;s not a dog, that&rsquo;s a coyote. It ran in the middle of the road. The vehicle actually grazed him. It stunned him for sure.&rdquo; Bill Peterson, personnel director and spokesman at the paper mill, confirmed that the mill last week had hired an animal control officer recommended by the Maine Warden Service to address the coyote problem. &ldquo;We are not going to expose our employees to any form of attack or bite,&rdquo; Peterson said. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t had anybody hurt but we are going to deal with it up front.&rdquo; No one knows why the coyotes are making an incursion so far into human territory. State biologists maintain that there are at least 12,000 in Maine, according to a Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife website page dedicated to the subject. Coyotes are described as medium-sized animals in the canine family, with pointed muzzles and long, bushy tails. Their coats are usually a mixture of tan, black and gray, but can range from black to strawberry blond. The average adult coyote weighs 30 to 35 pounds, with males being heavier than females. Large males only rarely will exceed 45 pounds, according to the page. They typically eat small animals, including snowshoe hare, mice, rats, woodchucks, beavers, squirrels, snakes, frogs, fish and animal carcasses. They mostly hunt at night. They avoid human contact and their attacks on humans are rare, according to the page. &ldquo;To date, there have been no documented coyote attacks on humans in Maine. There are documented cases in other states. Often the animals responsible had become accustomed to the presence of people, were fed, and-or were targeting dogs that accompanied people,&rdquo; the site states. A study of coyotes in southern California, the west&rsquo;s most populated state, &ldquo;found that from 1988 to 1997 there were 53 coyote attacks on humans resulting in 21 injuries,&rdquo; the page states. Summers warned residents to avoid feeding or having other contact with coyotes and to call 911 to report their presence.','https://bangordailynews.com/2014/11/06/news/penobscot/coyotes-humans-collide-as-the-canines-intrude-on-residential-areas-of-lincoln/','Unknown','Anthony Redmond','1','0',2,0,0,3,3,'Uniform',3,3,0,0,0,0),(1142,'2003-11-12','Illinois','Brookfield','Brookfield Zoo Police Departmen',1,100,0,'Wolf, Northern Gray, 11yo','A northern gray wolf was shot to death at Brookfield Zoo after it seized the arm of a woman who jumped a fence to reach into its cage, the first time in the zoo&#039;s 69-year history that an animal attacked a visitor, zoo officials said Thursday. Cinnamon Bear, an 11-year-old wolf born and raised at the zoo, was shot once in the chest Wednesday by a zoo police officer after the 100-pound animal clamped down on the woman&#039;s arm--and refused to let go--when she apparently tried to pet him. The animal was the last of the zoo&#039;s pack of northern gray wolves, dating to the mid-1950s, and was the only wolf on display at Brookfield Zoo, once a premier center for wolf research. The unaccompanied woman, identified only as 40 to 50 years old, apparently hopped a 3 1/2-foot fence and reached through a second 10-foot chain-link fence to touch the wolf, who was in a favorite sleeping corner of the outdoor pen, officials said Thursday. The wolf &quot;had grabbed her arm and was tugging,&quot; said Stuart D. Strahl, the zoo&#039;s new director. The incident took place about 1 p.m. in the zoo&#039;s remote northwest corner, on a cold and blustery day when total attendance was only about 1,100, said spokeswoman Sondra Katzen, who would not identify the woman. No other visitors saw the attack, she said. A zoo photographer driving a golf cart along a nearby access road heard the woman screaming, hurried to the scene and called police, officials said. A veteran officer arrived within two minutes and quickly determined that it would take too long to tranquilize the animal, Strahl said. The wolf would not release the woman&#039;s arm, so the officer drew his .45-caliber pistol and fired point-blank. The zoo maintains its own force of 15 deputized police officers and emergency personnel. The woman was taken to Loyola University Medical Center in nearby Maywood for treatment of her injured forearm. Hospital officials would not release information about the woman, but Brookfield Zoo Police Chief George Hull said her injuries were similar to a severe dog bite. &quot;You can imagine a dog bite,&quot; Hull said. &quot;This was a wolf bite.&quot; Strahl said zoo staffers remained in shock Thursday. &quot;I&#039;ve been working in zoos since I was a kid and I&#039;ve never seen anything like this,&quot; he said. &quot;We&#039;ve never had a real attack at all. It&#039;s also rare that anyone would put their arm in a cage, much less that of a carnivore.&quot; Cinnamon Bear had been moved to the conservation barn in the zoo&#039;s northwest corner, just south of 31st Street, a year ago when work began on a new Wolf Woods habitat. A group of five Mexican gray wolves, now in quarantine, will move into the exhibit in June. Officials had planned to leave Cinnamon Bear in his pen at the park&#039;s edge for the rest of his life, said Ann Petric, the zoo&#039;s curator of mammals. His last living brother died two years ago, and he had at most only a few years left to live. Wolves in captivity can live up to 15 years, while wild wolves typically live 6 to 8 years. It&#039;s exceedingly unusual for wolves--captive or wild--to attack humans, experts said. &quot;This is a rare thing. It is really an unfortunate incident all around,&quot; said Jane Ballentine, spokeswoman for the American Zoo and Aquarium Association. &quot;Wolves being what wolves are, they are generally skittish. The wolf was probably startled and surprised and was defending his territory from this `intruder.&#039;&quot; Though Brookfield Zoo has not had previous animal attacks, it has had its share of close encounters. In August 1996, a female gorilla rescued a 3-year-old boy who fell into the ape pit at the zoo&#039;s Tropic World Asia exhibit. In 1969, a group of polar bears escaped from their pen across a flooded moat and headed straight for a nearby marshmallow stand. The bears were quickly rounded up and returned to their enclosure. In Wednesday&#039;s attack, it would have been very difficult for zoo officials to persuade Cinnamon Bear to let go, said Rolf Peterson, an expert on wolf behavior who has studied wolves at Brookfield Zoo. He said wolves&#039; jaws don&#039;t lock, but they have an instinct to hang on. &quot;Wolves are not built to let go of things they want to hang on to. A person cannot pull the jaws of a wolf apart. You are not going to be too successful beating it over the head,&quot; said Peterson, a professor of wildlife biology at Michigan Technological University in Houghton. Brookfield Zoo, under former director George Rabb and his wife, Mary, became a leading research center in the 1960s and 1970s for studying wolves and their behaviors. &quot;They were one of the pioneers of wolf research in this country. They discovered the mating strategies in wolves,&quot; said Erich Klinghammer, director of the Wolf Park near Lafayette, Ind., where some of Cinnamon Bear&#039;s descendants live. &quot;They did some of the original work on wolf social behavior and, until this day, it is considered keynote work,&quot; said Susan Lindsey, director of the Wild Canid Survival and Research Center, a wolf conservation, reproduction and research center in Missouri where Brookfield Zoo obtained its pack of Mexican wolves last month. Lindsey said that Cinnamon Bear&#039;s age may have contributed to the way he reacted to a stranger&#039;s arm. &quot;Old animals, just like old people, don&#039;t have all their faculties. There is the likelihood that it couldn&#039;t see or hear or smell anymore,&quot; she said. &quot;Any of those things would cause the animal to be startled. I assume that it has never been touched like that.&quot;','http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2003-11-14/news/0311140210_1_zoo-officials-brookfield-zoo-gray-wolves','Cinnamon Bear','Unknown','1','0',1,1,0,0,0,'Uniform',1,1,2,2,2,0),(1143,'2013-07-23','California','Riverside','Riverside Police Department',1,100,0,'Wolf, Mixed breed','A mixed breed wolf had to be put down last night after being shot by a police officer during an early morning pursuit.

An eyewitness who did not want to give a statement to the police told Wills a different story. &quot;She started barking at him, the police officer then reached out to her and there&#039;s no record of dog bite or anything,&quot; said Wills. &quot;The witness said he pulled his gun and that&#039;s when he shot her the first time.&quot; Wills says Miley was then shot again before crawling to the side of the road. &quot;She somehow made it to the ditch where he proceeded to shoot her three more times,&quot; Wills said. The witness told Wills that Miley was shot five times. Pedersen says that&#039;s incorrect; it was three.

Wesley Jones and Aisling Jones filed a complaint Sept. 23 in Galveston County District Court against the City of Houston, a municipal corporation, Police Chief Charles McClelland, officer Adrian Lopez and officer Saul Delacruz individually and officially, citing negligence and malicious intent. According to the complaint, officers Lopez and Delacruz went to the plaintiffs&rsquo; home at 1339 Tulane St. in Houston on Oct. 19, 2012, to respond to a disturbance call made by a neighbor. The plaintiffs allege that as the officers approached the home, their dog Boss barked to alert their approach. According to the complaint, both officers then drew their weapons and fired at Boss, the family&rsquo;s pet of 8 years. The plaintiffs state that Boss made no aggressive move toward the officers. When the initial shots were fired, Boss was allegedly still inside the home and the officers fired over the threshold of the home and hit Boss. According to the report filed, Boss then ran around to the side of the home to his toys and the officers chased him down and proceeded to continue to shoot. Boss bled to death due to several gunshot wounds, the suit states. Current Houston Police Department policies state that the on-duty supervisor attends to the investigation when a dog is shot by an officer. Prior to March 25, 2007, all discharges of a firearm were investigated by the Internal Affairs Division, but that procedure has changed to save time and money. The plaintiffs filed a complaint with the Houston Police Department who ruled the shooting of Boss was justified. The plaintiffs seek damages due to mental anguish, property damage, and court costs. The plaintiffs are represented by attorneys Mark A. Morasch and David J. Batton of Houston.

A police car pulled up, screeched to a halt, and two Colorado Springs officers jumped out. The dog, whether alarmed, friendly or curious, moved toward them. One officer drew her gun and squeezed off four rounds. Three of them hit the dog, killing her. One shot apparently ricocheted off the pavement into Burch&#039;s house, piercing an upstairs window and narrowly missing Burch&#039;s 1-year-old son. What happened subsequently is in dispute. Burch says that the two officers grabbed him, dragged him face-down to the police cruiser, and handcuffed him. After 10 minutes they released him. Later, he was cited for &quot;failure to control&quot; an animal. The officers involved say that the &quot;staggering&quot; Burch was asked to control his dog several times before the fatal shooting, but failed to do so. Asked about the incident, Police Chief Pete Carey tells Independent reporter Pam Zubeck that police were responding to a call for service in the street in front of that home, but he won&#039;t specify what the call was. He does say, &quot;Any time the Police Department uses lethal force, there&#039;s an administrative review.

Another neighbor, Jeff Hillstrom, also said the dog is friendly. Hillstrom said Cara was &quot;like the neighborhood mascot.&quot; The Gazette also reported that Colorado Springs Police used excessive force in detaining Burch, who again, was simply sitting in front of his own house when police pulled up and murdered his dog. Josh Burch said a male officer told him to lie face down. The soldier said he did and immediately the officer grabbed him around the neck and dragged him about 20 feet into the middle of Sandpiper Drive where he was placed in handcuffs.\r\n\r\nBurch showed abrasions on his foot and nose and red marks on his neck where he said the male officer &quot;put his boot.&quot; Josh and Danielle Burch said they asked the officers for their badge numbers and names but said the officers refused to share the information.\r\n\r\nIn the release, police cited laws requiring animal owners to restrain their pets.

As the officers were driving in a fully marked police car in the 1100 block of Sandpiper Drive they encountered a male lying on the ground. The male, later identified as the owner of the dog was on his back with his feet up on the west curb. He was laying outstretched so that his legs, back and head were on the blacktop of the road. As an officer approached to check the male&rsquo;s welfare, the officer verbally identified themselves. They stated &ldquo;Police&rdquo; and requested the male show his hands. The male stood up and staggered towards the middle of the street. The male was noticeably intoxicated. The second officer noticed a large dog running towards the first officer. The first officer asked the male several times &ldquo;Is this your dog?&rdquo;, as they backed away from the rushing animal. The dog was charging aggressively, barking and growling. The dog moved forward from a distance of fifteen feet to within five feet of the officer. The officer fired a total of four shots at the dog. The dog succumbed to the injuries. Officers were contacted by a female due to a ricochet that had entered the window of a home. The female was identified as the wife of the male who was lying in the street. At the time of the incident the dog&rsquo;s owners were not cited pending conclusion of the investigation. When officers from the Colorado Springs Police Department make the difficult decision to use a firearm in order to protect themselves from an animal attack, they are guided by General Orders and Operating Policies. General Order 720 states in partial that &ldquo;Officers may use deadly force only to protect themselves or others from what the officers reasonably believe to be an immediate threat of death or serious bodily injury&rdquo;. &ldquo;The killing of an animal is justified to prevent substantial harm to the officer or another person, or when the animal is so badly injured that humanity requires its relief from further suffering.&rdquo; ','http://www.csindy.com/coloradosprings/four-bullets-and-a-pit-bull/Content?oid=2761354','Kara','Two Unknown Police, one male and one female','2','0',1,0,0,0,0,'Uniform',0,2,2,0,2,0),(1150,'2014-07-29','New York','West Seneca','Buffalo Police Department Narcotics Team and West Seneca Police Department',1,50,1,'Pit Bull, 1yo','On the early morning of July 29, 2014, Buffalo Police assisted on a raid in West Seneca.

Instead, he said officers only found a small stash of his roommate&#039;s marijuana. &quot;Not only did they not find any of the items listed in the warrant,&quot; the complaint states, &quot;they shot and killed my 15-month-old dog Rocky.&quot; Raiser plans to eventually file a notice of claim. &quot;I bawled my eyes out,&quot; Raiser said. &quot;It&#039;s hard. It really is.&quot; According to the use of force reports obtained by 2 On Your Side, the same police officer involved in the raid of Raiser&#039;s home also shot Arroyo&#039;s dog, Cindy, back in 2013. This is also the same officer who, as previously mentioned, shot 26 dogs in a three-and-a-half year span, more than any other officer in the department. Police Chief Richards explained that some officers act as the lead for the entry team during raids, which could place certain individuals in position to encounter aggressive dogs more often than others. &quot;It&#039;s a very dangerous job,&quot; Richards said, &quot;and per capita, the amount of work that we do, the amount of search warrants executed, the amount of calls answered by individual officers, I think the numbers are what the numbers are.&quot; Twenty-five of the 26 dogs shot by this officer died. In fact, more than three-quarters of the dogs shot by Buffalo Police died from their wounds. In Cincinnati and New York City, fewer than half of the dog shootings resulted in death. Richards said he couldn&#039;t explain the high percentage of fatalities. In Cincinnati, the police department&#039;s policy explicitly directs officers not to take head shots at dogs, if possible. Additional information not contained in the article: Detective Marrano was not the shooter. Detective Shawn D.

Yukio Jr., nicknamed &quot;Y.J.&quot;, was shot and killed by a Bexar County Sheriff&#039;s deputy sometime after 7 p.m. Monday in front of a home in the 3400 block of Copper Rim. Y.J., an American Bully breed, along with a younger dog of the same breed dug a hole under a side gate at the home, eventually breaking through the gate and getting out. A woman then called 911 and told dispatchers the dogs were terrorizing the neighborhood. A deputy who arrived on scene said Y.J. was aggressive. &quot;It is not a practice of our deputies to go out and just shoot dogs for no reason. Our deputy had a reason in this case,&quot; said BCSO spokesman James Keith. &quot;If we arrive on a scene and we feel an animal is causing a threat to public safety, our deputies have every right to take that scene under control. In some cases that means shooting the animal,&quot; added Keith. The deputy called county animal control after shooting Y.J., only to be told the animal control officer on duty was unavailable to assist. The deputy then shot the dog again, presumably to put him out of his misery, and placed his body in a plastic bag. &quot;No one&#039;s ever had a problem with our dogs, its not the first time the dogs have gotten out. A dog&#039;s going to get out,&quot; said Y.J.&#039;s owner King Kyle Lee. Lee pointed out the bloody paw prints and boot prints were all within a few feet of his house, indicating Y.J. was on his own property when he was shot. The American Bully Kennel Club, the official registry for the American Bully breed, lists the dog as being &quot;gentle&quot; and ideal for a family despite its stocky, muscular build. The deputy is unlikely to be disciplined for the shooting. A county spokeswoman said Wednesday the animal control office has only one officer on duty outside normal business hours, meaning one person is forced to cover the 1,257 square miles that make up the county&#039;s jurisdiction. The county&#039;s animal control office, established last year, consists of three officers. The county indicated Wednesday it is in the process of hiring more people for the department. &quot;This has been a common situation for us. Ever since the county went over to its own system, we&#039;ve had more circumstances like this. The staffing is not there,&quot; said Keith.','http://www.kens5.com/story/news/investigations/i-team/2014/10/29/bcso-animal-control-county-dog-shot-american-bully/18134867/','Yukio Jr AKA YJ','Unknown','1','0',2,0,0,2,2,'Uniform',0,2,2,0,2,0),(1154,'2014-11-19','Georgia','Americus','Americus Police Department',1,2,1,'Unconfirmed','A Georgia police officer has been charged with one count of aggravated cruelty to animals after investigators said he shot and killed a neighbor&#039;s dog.

On November 7, White said she watched him die. &quot;I wish I could erase it but you kind of can&#039;t,&quot; said White. Her mother is livid. &quot;How could you shoot two feet from human beings, and injure or kill one of us, because the dog is running around.

Chesterfield police say an Animal Control officer was in the area and in the middle of putting a pit bull in his truck when Clifford came up to the officer. Davis said her dog has never bit a person or an animal. But Chesterfield Police Captain Steve Neal said Clifford was aggressive and attacked the pit bull. Attempts to separate the two said Neal were unsuccessful. &quot;He never once tried to do anything with my dog other than kicking at him,&quot; said Davis. Neal said the officer then used lethal force. &quot;He made the decision. The dog had to be shot at that point,&quot; said Neal. Not once but twice said Davis. &quot;He pulled the gun out and shot the dog. Shot him in the hip. The dog fell in the street.

A week after his 4 year old pit bull was shot and killed by police in his girlfriends apartment, Eddie Harris said there are still plenty of signs of the dog in the home. A picture of the dog, Cane Lee Chaney, sits in a frame decorated with a red leash and collar on a table in the kitchen, and a large bloodstain where the animal took his last breath remains in the entryway. Harris said his girlfriend struggles to spend more than a few hours in the home since the shooting and he is still torn up over the loss. He aint just a dog, hes my son. You know what I mean? I looked at him like that. I was crying for three days straight, Harris said. He had a beautiful funeral. ... All dogs go to heaven. Harris, 20, said he, his girlfriend and a small group of friends buried Cane, who he had owned since he was weeks old, in the backyard of a friends home on Sunday, Nov. 30. He said the group held a candlelight vigil for the dog. It was only moments between the time he first heard footsteps in the entryway of his apartment, in the 500 block of S. Blackstone Street, and the gunshot around 4:30 p.m. on Nov. 28, he said. He said he and his girlfriends younger brother were upstairs in the apartment playing a game when they heard someone in the residence. Harris said Cane was next to him on the bed and suddenly charged downstairs growling when they heard the footsteps. He said he rushed down the stairs to see who was in the home to find a Jackson Police officer in the doorway. ...And then Boom! Shot him, right there, dead in the head, Harris said. So I instantly started going off on the police. ... You entered my home without permission? Why is you even here? And then you shoot my dog? Whyd you shoot my dog? Harris said the officer told him Cane bit him, but added it doesnt make sense. He called the pit bull harmless and said the officer laughed at him when he asked to see his bite wound. Like I told him you didnt have to shoot him in the head, you could have shot him in the body, Harris said. Clear as day if my dog was trying to bite you, or bit you, your partner would shoot my dog. You wouldnt have been able to shoot my dog because he would have been biting you and shaking you at the same time. You wouldnt have been able to aim or nothing. ... But no, he shot him point blank, period. Jackson Police Lt. Christopher Simpson said an internal investigation into the incident has been launched. The officers remain on active-duty during the investigation, Simpson said. Simpson said the officer reported being approached aggressively by the pit bull while in the area to execute a judge signed petition but Harris said he does not know the person of interest they were looking for. Harris said he has been in contact with Simpson and has been assured the incident will not be forgotten. He said he just wants justice for his pet. Shamsidden Brown, a friend of Harris, said he was sitting on the steps of the Jackson Interfaith Shelter, 414 S. Blackstone St., with a friend when he saw police go from an apartment in the center of the building and then to Harris girlfriends apartment. Before he even got to the door, I was like, They gonna shoot Eddies dog and as soon as I said it, thats when I heard the shot, Brown said. Brown said he has known Cane since he was a puppy and said the animal was gentle despite his size. Harris said he is awaiting reports from the Jackson Police Department before he determines how he will proceed. He said he has spoken with several lawyers. Now I keep the door closed, Harris said. If he wouldnt have shot my dog this wouldnt have been no big deal, but he entered my home and shot my dog dead and (the officer) shot him for protecting his home, what he is supposed to do, what he was trained to do.','http://www.mlive.com/news/jackson/index.ssf/2014/12/fatal_shooting_of_pit_bull_by.html','Cane Lee Chaney','Matt Peters badge number 013','1','0',2,0,0,2,2,'Uniform',0,2,0,2,2,2),(1160,'2014-11-25','California','Los Banos','Los Banos Police Department and Los Banos Animal Control',1,2,0,'Unknown police claim German shepherd','The following article is reproduced from The Las Banos Enterprise: A police officer shot and killed a stray dog Tuesday evening in front of residents that had been playing with it hours earlier, sparking a debate of whether the animal was dangerous or mishandled by law enforcement. Cmdr. Jason Hedden said an officer responded to the 1100 block of Pinot Noir Street at 6:25 p.m. after receiving a report of a stray dog in the area. The officer, whose name is being withheld by law enforcement, attempted to take custody of the animal, a large German shepherd. Hedden said the dog bit the officer&rsquo;s hand as he tried to lead it away. Hedden said the dog then attempted to jump on the officer&rsquo;s back. The officer then shot and killed the dog, Hedden said. Laura Gomez, who lives on Pinot Noir Street and whose family takes care of strays, said the dog had roamed in the neighborhood and she was taking care of it. &ldquo;The dog was playful,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We started giving him food and he played with the kids.&rdquo; Gomez said earlier in the day she had planned to put the dog in the backyard, take a picture of it and post it on Facebook to find the owner. According to Gomez, she was then advised to contact Petco, which directed her to Los Banos Animal Control at the Police Department. Gomez said she believes the dog hopped over her fence while she was inside. She said the officer arrived and mishandled the dog. &ldquo;He grabbed the dog from the neck. He kept grabbing the dog and the dog got mad,&rdquo; she said, adding that she advised the officer to try to coax him into the vehicle by playing fetch. Gomez said the dog became aggressive and the officer shot it twice. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why they would send someone out here who doesn&rsquo;t know how to handle dogs,&rdquo; she said. Hedden said the officer has not been placed on leave although the incident is being investigated. He said from the initial reports, he believes the officer acted appropriately. &ldquo;We have a witness who saw the dog attack the officer,&rdquo; Hedden said. &ldquo;When he went to work, he didn&rsquo;t expect to have a dog bite his hand or to have to shoot a dog. It boils down to an irresponsible pet owner.&rdquo; Hedden said the dog&rsquo;s body will be examined as part of the police investigation.

Montgomery is a level-3 sex offender, and Anderson promptly turned him away from the house.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later, three Minneapolis police officers arrived in pursuit of Montgomery. Anderson&#039;s husband met them in the yard, and said Montgomery had fled through the back door. One the family&#039;s dogs appeared, and as Anderson&#039;s husband tried to collect it, an officer shouted &quot;pit bull,&quot; and the three open fired. In the hail of gunfire, an officer was somehow shot in the leg.\r\n\r\nLater that night, about 30 officers showed up to Anderson&#039;s house, apparently thinking someone living there shot their fellow officer. They handcuffed Anderson&#039;s family, and began trashing the house. Among the items listed as destroyed or damaged: a flat-screen TV, several windows and doors, a pool table, and a fish tank -- killing the family&#039;s fish and hermit crabs.\r\n\r\nThe lawsuit also includes an autopsy report of the dog, performed by the University of Minnesota&#039;s college of veterinary medicine. The report confirms the dog was put down March 31 and that it was &quot;shot multiple times.&quot; The dog suffered from a total of 10 puncture wounds, and had one slug and several fragments removed from its body.\r\n\r\nLeah Anderson v.

A few weeks later, police shot another pit bull in north Minneapolis, but this story has a happier ending.\r\n\r\nThe dog, who Minneapolis Animal Care and Control (MACC) named Chance, was shot on June 16 around 8:30 p.m. in Columbia Heights. Rachel Mairose, the director of local rescue group Secondhand Hounds, met him last Thursday, when MACC made him available for rescue. The next day, she took him home to foster.\r\n\r\nOne bullet traveled through Chance&#039;s face, shattered his bottom teeth and exited his neck. &quot;This was not a long range shot,&quot; Mairose said. The dog also has a puncture wound in his front right shoulder that may be a second bullet, and that causes him to limp. Despite the shooting, Chance does not seem violent. &quot;If there is any sort of aggressive history, MACC can&#039;t release the dog for rescue,&quot; Mairose said. &quot;So we know there&#039;s nothing recorded.&quot;\r\n\r\nShe adds that Chance passed a temperament test &quot;with flying colors,&quot; and fits in well with her two-year-old daughter and her two other dogs, one Havanese and one pit bull. &quot;He&#039;s a big marshmallow,&quot; she said. &quot;He&#039;s been an easy dog to adjust.&quot;\r\n\r\nAccording to Minneapolis police spokesman Sgt. Steve McCarty, the shooting happened after the dog was loose at a sporting event of about 160 people. An animal control agent came to round him up, but couldn&#039;t catch him, so the agent called police. Still unable to secure the dog, police shot him.\r\n\r\nThere is no report of an attack. &quot;The background is hazy,&quot; Mairose said. &quot;And there&#039;s a lot of people angry that this would happen, but most of the details are speculative. In general the police department has been great about bringing the dogs they find to MACC, so I want to give them the benefit of the doubt, but it seems like a weird situation that a dog this friendly and this people-oriented would have to be shot at.&quot;\r\n\r\nChance is scheduled for X-rays this week to check for a lodged bullet on his right side, and for any lingering bone or tooth fragments that require surgical removal.

Note the immediate language in the lead rationalizing the shooting: The Anderson police chief was forced to shoot a pit bull Monday afternoon after the dog attacked him. Authorities said multiple dogs were hanging out of the window of a home near 17th and Fourth streets. When Chief Willie Weber arrived, one of the dogs jumped out of the window. According to Weber, the dog bit him in the leg and when he eventually shook the dog off, it showed its teeth and mauled him again. &ldquo;They jumped out the window and came at me. The male bit me in the leg. I tried to shake him off, but he came back at me with his teeth showing. I had to shoot him,&rdquo; Weber said. Weber told Channel 11&rsquo;s Amy Marcinkiewicz that he had no choice but to shoot the dog. The dog died from the gunshot wound. Neighbors who live in the area told Marcinkiewicz they agree that Weber had no choice but to shoot the dog. &ldquo;He got ahold of Willie&rsquo;s leg and wouldn&rsquo;t let go. He had to shoot him,&rdquo; neighbor John Moffa said. Animal Control officers and the Fire Department came to the scene to make sure all of the windows in the house were closed because of the other dogs in the house. Marcinkiewicz reported the dog&#039;s owner, Velvet Morris, wasn&rsquo;t home at the time of the incident. When Morris returned, she cried as she told Marcinkiewicz that she doesn&#039;t fault Weber. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t fault the chief for doing what he did. I don&rsquo;t want my dog to take nobody&rsquo;s life. He had to save his own,&rdquo; Morris said. Morris said if the chief felt his life was threatened, she understands why he shot her dog. &ldquo;The dogs are my babies, but I don&rsquo;t fault him,&rdquo; Morris said.','http://www.wpxi.com/news/news/local/arnold-police-chief-shoots-dog-attacked-officer/ngfmF/','Unknown','Police Chief Willie Weber','1','0',2,0,0,2,2,'Uniform',0,2,0,0,2,0),(1167,'2012-07-05','Ohio','Aurora','Aurora Police Dept',1,30,0,'Australian Shepherd, 6 yrs old','AURORA, Ohio - A Northeast Ohio woman says her dog was killed by a police officer during a traffic stop.\r\n\r\nThomi West, 53, said she was pulled over on July 5 by Aurora police officer Chris Ryder.

Matthew Belanger and his wife were sitting in their home in the 1100 block of South Atlanta Place when an officer knocked on their door, saying police had shot a dog and asking them to see whether it belonged to them. &ldquo;I thought, &lsquo;Surely that&rsquo;s not my dog,&rsquo;&rdquo; Belanger said. &ldquo;But I went outside, and there he was.&rdquo; Hank, a 35-pound mixed breed, had been in the backyard with their other dog when he somehow got out without anyone&rsquo;s knowledge, Belanger said. The dog had been rescued as a puppy a few years ago by Belanger&rsquo;s brother-in-law. Belanger and his wife took Hank in when his brother-in-law feared he could no longer care for the dog appropriately, he said. A police report on the shooting was filed Friday, Officer Leland Ashley said, although the report will not be available until next week, according to the department&rsquo;s Records Division. Ashley said the report says a woman who was walking her dog in the neighborhood told police she pepper-sprayed Hank after he attacked her, which made the dog become aggressive.\r\nThe woman reported the incident to police, who went to the area just before 6 p.m. Officer Don Chandler was standing outside his vehicle when the dog &ldquo;became aggressive,&rdquo; according to the report. Chandler, Ashley said, yelled at the dog to stop, and then shot him twice. Ashley said the report did not mention any injuries to the woman who reported being attacked. Belanger said the official retelling of the events is questionable, although he acknowledged that because he was inside at the time, he can&rsquo;t say what happened. Hank, he said, was essentially a lap dog who mainly lived inside.\r\n&ldquo;I just can&rsquo;t believe my dog attacked someone. It goes against everything I&rsquo;ve ever seen him do,&rdquo; Belanger said. &ldquo;I imagine he probably ran up to her because he wanted to get petted. That&rsquo;s what he does. After he was pepper-sprayed, I don&rsquo;t know what his reaction would be.&rdquo; Belanger said he wants &ldquo;justice,&rdquo; but he said he couldn&rsquo;t define what justice in the case would entail. If Hank really was attacking a police officer, he said, he hoped the officer would shoot him. &ldquo;I understand that a human life is more valuable than my dog&rsquo;s life. I completely understand that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I trust the police. I trust that they&rsquo;re here to protect us. It&rsquo;s just hard for me to believe that this was the only option available &mdash; to shoot a dog that had only loved people his entire life.&rdquo; The officer will not face a review board for the shooting, Ashley said, as is mandatory when shots are fired at a human.

Note that the shooter, Michael Mustachio, was fired from the police force, settled a civil lawsuit with the victim&#039;s family out of court, and was found guilty of felony aggravated cruelty to animals: After nearly two hours of deliberation, a White County jury found a former Gwinnett County Sheriff&#039;s sergeant guilty of aggravated cruelty to animals in connection with the Christmas Eve 2004 shooting of a coon hound belonging to his mother&#039;s neighbor. Michael Mustachio maliciously and knowingly shot and killed the dog, named Kate, on his mother&#039;s Wauka Ridge Road property during a family gathering, the jury ruled Tuesday evening. Mustachio was sentenced to five years probation, 60 days of community service in an animal shelter and could be fined up to $15,000. He also must undergo anger management classes during his probationary period, Judge David Barrett ruled. White County Assistant District Attorney Kerry Banister, representing the state, had requested Mustachio receive five years in prison with a period served in a probation detention center, 30 days of community service and a fine. Dan Summer, Mustachio&#039;s defense attorney, insisted that his client didn&#039;t set out to do anything wrong the night the dog was shot. &quot;He made a bad choice,&quot; Summer said. &quot;I would ask you have mercy on this man.&quot; Summer asked that Barrett consider giving Mustachio a lighter sentence since it was his first offence, which Barrett denied. On the night in question, Stanley Barnes, along with friends Don Maney and Brent Thomas, had been out hunting with two female treeing Walkers when they heard shots fired 10 to 20 minutes later. Maney&#039;s dog, Lady, was barking at something in a tree nearby, but Barnes couldn&#039;t find Kate when he tried to use a tracking device attached to her collar. The dog was later found dead in the back of Mustachio&#039;s truck under a bunch of trash bags. Her tracking collar, as well as its antenna, had been cut off. During the trial, several members of Mustachio&#039;s family gave their accounts of what happened that Christmas Eve. Helen King, Mustachio&#039;s aunt, said the family was exchanging gifts when they heard growling, snarling and yelping. They assumed it was wild animals. &quot;It was scary,&quot; she said, adding that the noise sounded like it was right on the front porch. Mustachio&#039;s father, Ted, a retired Gwinnett County firefighter, said his son fired shots in order to scare the animals away. &quot;We weren&#039;t trying to kill anything,&quot; he said. When the three hunters wouldn&#039;t leave the Mustachios&#039; property, Ted Mustachio suggested to his son that they might have hit a dog. After walking about 45 yards up the mountain from the house, Ted Mustachio said they saw a dog laying with its head on its paws. &quot;My emotion was, &#039;the poor animal,&#039;&quot; he said. He picked the dog up and carried it to the house, where Mustachio cut off its collar and he cut off the antenna. When Banister asked why he cut the collar, he replied, &quot;We were afraid.&quot; Officials with the White County Sheriff&#039;s Office were called to the Mustachios&#039; property twice that night within a period of about 30 minutes. Officer Jarrett Fry, who came to the property both times, said there was nothing to indicate that Mustachio knew a dog had been shot. Both Ted and June Mustachio said they weren&#039;t aware an animal had been struck before Kate was found. They also didn&#039;t see any visible signs of trauma on the dog. Barnes had an autopsy performed on Kate at the University of Georgia&#039;s college of veterinary medicine. Elizabeth Howerth, head of the college&#039;s pathology department, said based on the report that the dog had been shot through the neck. The bullet broke several bones and caused the lungs to hemorrhage. She said other than the gunshot wound, there was no other sign that the dog had been maimed or tortured in any way. In her closing arguments, Banister said that Mustachio knowingly and maliciously killed the dog because he tried to cover it up, and that a dog doesn&#039;t have to be strung up to be maliciously killed. &quot;It went looking for a coon and this is what it got in return,&quot; she said. In his closing statement, Summer told the jury that doing something maliciously means mean-spirited, done with a black heart. &quot;This is not maliciousness, folks,&quot; he said, adding that there was no indication anyone knew the dog had been hit. Just before Mustachio&#039;s sentencing, Barrett said that when someone straps on a .40-caliber pistol, they carry with them a certain amount of responsibility. At this point, Barrett told Mustachio, &quot;Law enforcement&#039;s not a career you need to be in.&quot; Additional links:\r\n\r\nhttp://forums.ukcdogs.com/printthread.php?s=5e7e8dbab160a2b69388bc34c826c34f&amp;threadid=234163\r\n\r\nhttp://gainesvillelegals.com/news/stories/20070918/localnews/197365.shtml\r\n\r\nhttp://www.accessnorthga.com/detail-pf.php?n=125434\r\n\r\nhttp://gainesvillelegals.com/news/stories/20070127/localnews/152493.shtml\r\n\r\nhttp://gainesvillelegals.com/news/stories/20050205/localnews/73801.shtml\r\n\r\nhttp://gainesvillelegals.com/news/stories/20050130/localnews/72359.shtml\r\n\r\nhttp://barkingdogs.net/newsgagainesville.shtml Michael Mustachio was involved with at least one other lawsuit involving misuse of force, Williams et al v Taser International et al, where it was alleged Mustachio tastered a man inappropriately causing severe injuries.','http://gainesvillelegals.com/news/stories/20070918/localnews/197365.shtml','Kate','Michael Mustachio','1','0',2,0,0,0,0,'Plain Clothes',3,3,1,1,1,1),(1180,'2014-12-07','New Jersey','Atlantic City','Atlantic City Police',1,2,1,'Unconfirmed','The following article is reproduced from the Press of Atlantic City newspaper: An officer who was attacked Sunday by a pit bull type dog while responding to a call about two loose dogs was treated for his injuries and released from the hospital.

Chief Horne said Keith Thompson was responsible for the dogs when they escaped from the fenced backyard while Ms. Lammers was away last week. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s unfortunate that it happened,&rdquo; the chief said. &ldquo;You hate to be in that situation.&rdquo; The chief said the request for the charge was forwarded to the city prosecutor&rsquo;s office Monday. Findlay Municipal Court did not have record of a charge Tuesday night. According to a police report, Capt. Sean Young was off duty and on his way home at 5:18 p.m. Dec. 3 &mdash; still in uniform and driving an unmarked city vehicle &mdash; when he saw two loose dogs menacing a United Parcel Service deliveryman on foot in the 1000 block of West Sandusky Street. Joshua Launder, of Arlington, Ohio, said in his written witness statement that the dogs were &ldquo;running aggressively toward me.&rdquo; &ldquo;One was barking at me and acted quite mean,&rdquo; he said. When the dogs ran off, Captain Young requested an additional unit and continued to search for them, encountering resident Jonathan Anderson, who indicated the dogs were aggressive. Mr. Anderson walked out to Putnam Street to tell the officer, who had parked his car two houses down from Ms. Lammers&rsquo; home, where he thought the dogs lived. The officer said the dogs ran at him from between houses across the street while barking. &ldquo;Their heads were held low and they began to spread out as if to attack from two sides,&rdquo; Captain Young wrote. &ldquo;Both dogs were fixated on me and kept their eye on me.&rdquo; After drawing his service weapon, Captain Young said one of the dogs, a black-and-white &ldquo;pit bull&rdquo; named Kirby, stopped. The officer said a tan boxer named Chase continued to approach, and he shot it twice at a distance of about 8 feet. The officer was on the radio again calling for assistance, and the shots can be heard on the recording. The department does not have cameras in its vehicles or body cameras for officers. Kirby retreated and fled to Ms. Lammers&rsquo; home when called by Mr. Thompson, but Chase allegedly growled and was getting back up when the officer fired the third and fatal shot. Captain Young declined to comment. A review by Lt. Robert Ring of the Findlay Police Department that was completed Monday determined the captain did not violate any department policies. Chief Horne said because Captain Young, who owns dogs himself, is an administrative officer, he does not carry a baton, pepper spray, or a stun gun. Mr. Anderson said he had a clear view of the entire incident. &ldquo;If that was me, I would have thought he was going to bite me,&rdquo; Mr. Anderson said, referring to Chase. &ldquo;Honestly, I think that officer had every right to do it. That dog was coming at him like he was going to do something.&rdquo; Ms. Lammers said the dogs, who are properly licensed, have gotten loose a number of times by squeezing under the 4-foot-high chain-link fence. She has been using various materials to reinforce the fence, trying to prevent them from escaping. An electric wire runs through the fence, but shorted out and is not working. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried everything,&rdquo; Ms. Lammers said. &ldquo;I honestly don&rsquo;t know how they&rsquo;re getting out.&rdquo; Mr. Thompson said he had let the dogs out in the backyard to urinate. When he called them in about five minutes later, they did not return. So he went to the front door and saw Kirby crouched down on the sidewalk. &ldquo;I knew something was wrong,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I told him to get his butt inside and he ran in.&rdquo; Captain Young then informed him he had shot Chase. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t believe he shot the dog,&rdquo; Mr. Thompson said. &ldquo;It upset me to no end and I&rsquo;ve been upset ever since.&rdquo; He said he did not see what happened or hear the shots. He said Kirby is skittish, but Chase is more forward. &ldquo;He has a tendency to try to be boss,&rdquo; Mr. Thompson said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just his personality. But he&rsquo;s never bitten anyone.&rdquo; Ms. Lammers said the dogs were pepper-sprayed by a mail carrier several months ago when they got out and approached her, with Chase getting the brunt of it. No report was filed in that incident, but Ms. Lammers said the woman was scared but not injured. Neither the Hancock County dog warden&rsquo;s office nor the Findlay Police Department have reports or complaints about Chase or Kirby on file. The owner said she is focusing on trying to figure out what happened and on protecting Kirby. At this time, she does not plan to seek disciplinary action against Captain Young or the department, nor does she intend to file a lawsuit. &ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t want them to take Kirby,&rdquo; Ms. Lammers said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe what happened to Chase is right, but I wouldn&rsquo;t go after the town. I don&rsquo;t believe in suing.&rdquo; One of the department&rsquo;s previous K-9 dogs, a Belgian Malinois named Flip, was shot and killed by a resident who felt threatened by him after the dog escaped from his handler&rsquo;s home. &ldquo;We know firsthand how that feels,&rdquo; the chief said.','http://www.toledoblade.com/Police-Fire/2014/12/10/Findlay-police-accusing-caretaker-in-shot-dog-case.html','Chase','Sean Young','2','0',2,0,0,1,1,'Uniform',3,3,0,0,2,0),(1184,'2013-03-21','Ohio','Massillon','Stark County Deputy Dog Warden',1,2,1,'Dog','A dog is recovering after being shot by a Stark County Deputy Dog Warden.\r\n\r\nOfficials say on Thursday March 21, Deputy Dog Warden Sedlacko responded to a call in Massillon.\r\n\r\nUpon arrival, Deputy Sedlacko says he exited his vehicle onto the public roadway and was  rushed by 3 American Bulldog Pit Bull type dogs who ran off of their owner&#039;s property onto the roadway.\r\n\r\nAlthough these dogs were not the subject of the call that initiated the visit, Deputy Sedlacko says behavior of the dogs became so aggressive, he was forced to use his firearm in self-defense, wounding one of the dogs in the roadway.\r\n\r\nThe deputy transported the wounded dog to a veterinary clinic where the dog was treated and is expected to make a full recovery.\r\n\r\nThe owner of the dog was cited for failure to file application for registration of dog, failure to comply with rabies registration, and failure to keep dog under control.\r\n\r\nStark County Dog Warden Reagan Tetreault says after a thorough and complete internal review of all the circumstances surrounding the incident, it has been conclusively found that Deputy Sedlacko properly followed all procedures, and properly acted in self-defense.','http://www.19actionnews.com/story/21769334/dog-shot-by-a-stark-county-deputy-dog-warden','Unknown','Deputy Phil Sedlacko','2','1',2,0,0,0,1,'Uniform',3,3,0,2,2,0),(1185,'2011-07-25','Ohio','Canton','StarStark County Dog Warden',1,2,0,'Dog','Several animal advocates addressed county commissioners over a dog which bled to death. They expressed their outrage over a YouTube video which shows the dog being hosed down before it died.\r\n\r\n&quot;That was a living thing that was allowed to bleed to death,&quot; said Ellen Shankle of Canton, who spoke to the Stark County Commissioners at the conclusion of their regular meeting on Wednesday.\r\n\r\nShankle said responsibility for the Stark County Dog Warden&#039;s office falls directly on the commissioners.  She and other animal rights advocates were reacting to the video which has been played more than 4,000 times since it was posted online six days ago.\r\n\r\nStark County officials say the incident took place on July 25, 2011, and that deputy dog warden Phil Sedlacko was disciplined after an investigation a few days later. Sedlacko had tranquilized and captured a dog which a caller had said was &quot;insane and crazy.&quot;\r\n\r\nWhen the sedated dog was brought to the Stark County dog pound, Sedlacko washed it down with a hose, while the dog lay tranquilized in a cage. The dog had been bleeding from the spot on its chest where the tranquilizer dart struck.\r\n\r\nVideo shows the dog then being dragged out of the cage and onto the floor of the pound, where Dog Warden Reagan Tetreault and Sedlacko are seen examining the wound on the dog&#039;s chest. What no one realized at the time, say county commissioners, was that the dart had nicked an artery and was causing internal bleeding.\r\n\r\nAn official report of the incident says staff at the Dog Warden&#039;s Department made frequent checks on the dog&#039;s condition and called a veterinarian when the animal seemed to be too lethargic, too long.\r\n\r\nThey were advised to keep the animal under observation, and reported back during the day. When the dog was still unresponsive in the evening, it was taken to the Emergency Veterinary Clinic, where it died while plans to euthanize the animal were being discussed.\r\n\r\nAs part of the investigation, the prosecutor&#039;s office examined what happened that day. &quot;There was not sufficient evidence of any criminal activity,&quot; assistant prosecutor Michael Bickis told WKYC, &quot;and they were not going forward with criminal charges.&quot;\r\n\r\nSedlacko&#039;s hosing down of the dog was found to be in violation of departmental regulations. He was also criticized by some for not seeking veterinary assistance faster.\r\n\r\nStark County Commissioners on Wednesday heard passionate pleas from the animal rights activists who addressed them on the issue.\r\n\r\n&quot;It makes me sick that my taxes go to pay this man&#039;s salary,&quot; Mackenzie Smith said, &quot;when he let him die on a cold floor and hosed him down after he was sedated.&quot;\r\n\r\nBickis said the dog did not die on the floor of the dog pound, but later at the vet&#039;s office. He and commissioners said the information posted with the YouTube video was incomplete and inaccurate.\r\n\r\nStill, the commissioners pledged to look at the incident once again, and review the activities and track record of the Dog Warden&#039;s office.\r\n\r\n&quot;There have been ongoing issues over there,&quot; acknowledged Commissioner Tom Bernabei. &quot;It&#039;s an unfortunate set of events that occurred. The good that will come out of it is that we will pay additional and more attention to the Dog Warden&#039;s office.&quot;\r\n\r\nStark County Administrator Michael Hanke plans to spend all day Friday looking into the Dog Warden&#039;s office.

She said the situation that initiated the police response was a misunderstanding, and the gunfire that left Boosie wounded was preventable.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;What (my boyfriend) did has nothing to do with them pulling their gun out and shooting (Boosie),&rdquo; Jett said. &ldquo;They need to train their police officers or put in some type of rule that they need to pepper spray or Taser or do something like that before they shoot dogs.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nAccording to Gwinnett County police incident reports, officers responded to the QuikTrip gas station at 2571 Satellite Blvd. that day after a passerby reported seeing Jett and her boyfriend exchanging blows. Jett said she was upset because she spilled tea in her lap and argued with her boyfriend, but things never got physical.\r\n\r\nRegardless, officers spotted their vehicle driving past the QuikTrip and initiated a traffic stop.\r\n\r\nThe car, driven by Jett&rsquo;s boyfriend, pulled back into the gas station and parked. Spurred by a suspended driver&rsquo;s license, Jett&rsquo;s boyfriend fled on foot. Officers gave chase.\r\n\r\nSomewhere in the confusion, Boosie got out of the car and began running as well. One incident report said the dog &ldquo;growled and charged&rdquo; at two officers several times &ldquo;in a threatening manner.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nJett said she repeatedly asked the officers if she could attempt to wrangle Boosie.

There&#039;s blood on the walls and in my yard. And nobody apologized for killing my dog.&quot; It all started around 10:30 p.m. on Wednesday, Dec. 10. Robinson had just placed her infant child in bed when she heard a knock at the door of her home located in the 1800 block of Spanish Town Road. &quot;I had my dog inside with me because it was cold outside,&quot; she recalled. &quot;A pizza man came and knocked on my door. I cracked the door and told him I didn&#039;t order any pizza.&quot; The delivery driver left the house and Robinson went about turning in for the night. She says it was about 10 minutes later when there was another knock at her door. &quot;The police came to the door and I cracked the door and had the dog on the chain,&quot; she said. Police started questioning her about who lived in the home. She says they asked the father of Robinson&#039;s child to come outside to talk to them. &quot;When he stepped out, the dog stepped out, too, and was growling,&quot; Robinson admitted. &quot;And then they pulled out their guns and shot my dog in the face.&quot; Robinson was inside when the shooting happened. She says she heard three gun shots. Her dog ran inside, tracking blood on the floor along the way. &quot;It&#039;s so hard for me to talk about because I had him since he was three weeks old,&quot; Robinson said. &quot;I watched him grow up big and to see him come back in the house coughing up blood, I just can&#039;t believe it.&quot; Animal Control officers were called to the scene after the shooting. Robinson signed a release form to allow the agency to take her 1-year-old pit bull to the shelter for treatment. &quot;We brought the animal to the shelter, at which point the Companion Animal Alliance met the officer to examine the animal,&quot; said Hilton Cole, director for the East Baton Rouge Parish Animal Shelter. &quot;At that point they decided the animal should be euthanized.&quot; Robinson said officers were at her home for roughly two hours from beginning to end. What she didn&#039;t know, however, is that the whole thing started with a call from the pizza delivery driver. &quot;Someone ordered a pizza that was supposed to be delivered to the address where the dog was located,&quot; explained Cpl. L&#039;Jean McKneely, Baton Rouge Police Department. &quot;After the driver was sent away from the door, a male walked up to the delivery driver and claimed the pizzas were for him. That person paid for them with counterfeit money, so the driver called and reported it to police.&quot; The manager on duty at the Domino&#039;s Pizza located on Government Street confirmed that the order was placed and that the driver reported the incident to police. The manager tells us that the counterfeit money included six $20 bills. &quot;It was a very large order,&quot; the manager noted. The case regarding the counterfeit money is still under investigation. The shooting of Robinson&#039;s dog, however, is considered a closed matter. &quot;The officer was issued a drug test, which is standard procedure,&quot; Cpl. McKneely noted. &quot;The officer was not placed on paid administrative leave.&quot; According to police as well as Animal Control investigators, the officer acted in self-defense. &quot;The officer obviously felt he was in danger,&quot; Cole noted. &quot;The officer said there were no trees to hide behind and no way to avoid the dog,&quot; Cpl.

The incident happened June 27 while the family wasn&rsquo;t home.  A deputy was serving Carwile a civil warrant when he said he felt threatened by the dog. &ldquo;I come home to blood all over the place all over my porch,&rdquo; said Carwile. He called the sheriff&rsquo;s office after he couldn&rsquo;t find Party, then saw his blood stained deck and the warrant. &ldquo;The lieutenant called me and stated that my dog had tried to attack the officer and the officer had shot my dog.&rdquo; The Prince Edward Sheriff&rsquo;s office put out the following press release: On June 27, 2014 a Prince Edward County Deputy was charged by a vicious dog at a residence while he was attempting civil paper service.

The sheriff&rsquo;s department said the incident was investigated by the Virginia State Police, however a state police spokeswoman said that was not the case. &ldquo;The resident did speak with Sgt.

Witnesses said the dog did nothing to deserve it, and now a petition is circulating online to force the mayor to resign. Mayor Jim Cole of Walnut Grove is the focus of that petition, after he shot and killed a Border Collie in October. It was a stray dog that the city attorney described as &quot;vicious.&quot; Witnesses, however, paint a different picture of what happened. Willard &quot;JR&quot; Mahurin owns and operates JR&#039;s Garage. &quot;Well I was standing on the front porch of my house and saw him out there with a shotgun. First thing I know, I heard a shot. [Cole] shot that dog...with a shotgun,&quot; Mahurin explains. He said the dog was then thrown in the back of a truck. &quot;Well I didn&#039;t like it because they shot her. The dog wasn&#039;t mine but it had a right to live same as anything else, you know...[Cole] said he could do what he wanted to because he was the mayor. I don&#039;t think he&#039;s any better than anybody else. I think he should do what the people who are going to vote him in want, or get somebody that will,&quot; Mahurin said. City Attorney Ken Reynolds confirmed the shooting, but said the dog was vicious and &quot;about to attack children.&quot; But witnesses said that was not the case. &quot;She had those eight pups,&quot; Mahurin said. The puppies were said to be six-weeks old. &quot;I&#039;d probably be growling at somebody that was messing with my pups too...to keep them away from them,&quot; Mahurin said. Another person who lives in Walnut Grove did not want to be identified for this report. &quot;She was trying to protect her babies. That&#039;s the only way to look at that...God didn&#039;t put those animals here to be tortured. It&#039;s had me all upset ever since it happened,&quot; the person said. &quot;I would not like for it to happen again,&quot; Mahurin said. Lynn O&#039;Toole of Walnut Grove started an online petition. &quot;I knew the dog. I had been feeding it. It was a stray,&quot; O&#039;Toole explained. She said the petition has one goal. &quot;For the mayor to resign. I don&#039;t feel that it&#039;s appropriate to have a mayor who would handle a situation in such a needlessly brutal manner,&quot; O&#039;Toole said. And as for the eight puppies, O&#039;Toole said Mayor Cole tried to give them away at a convenience store. &quot;He did take some of the puppies in there and said, &#039;Would someone like these or should I kill them?&#039;&quot; O&#039;Toole stated. She said there were many offers to take the adult Border Collie that had been around town for a year. &quot;There were offers from rescues to take it, and I had offered to take it...I can&#039;t imagine why he would have shot it,&quot; O&#039;Toole said. O&#039;Toole is hoping the petition, which already has 888 signatures, will gain more attention. Attorney Reynolds told KSPR that a petition with signatures from out of state would not be valid, legally, to remove the mayor. But as O&#039;Toole stated, the goal is to &quot;show the city government that his actions were inhumane, and that he should resign.&quot; &quot;I have watched this dog look both ways before crossing a highway. There aren&#039;t too many dogs that do this. She was exceptionally bright. I thought she was very special,&quot; O&#039;Toole said.

As you may recall, during a totally routine raid on the home of cockfighting suspect Jesus Llovera, Seagal captained a SWAT tank to lead dozens of officers in riot gear as they first set off explosives as a distraction, then knocked down Llovera&rsquo;s fence and a surrounding wall, blew out the windows in his house, swarmed his family living room, and killed the approximately 100 or so chickens they found on the property. Caught in the fray, according to Llovera, was his family&rsquo;s 11-month-old puppy, which Llovera claims was shot by police. After being presented with a notice outlining those events, as well as Llovera&rsquo;s intention to file a lawsuit for the damages and demand for a written apology from Seagal to his children for the death of their puppy, both Seagal and Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio&mdash;the star of his own mental maverick detective show where he probably imagines himself as the spitting image of James Garner&mdash;have responded that the claim is &ldquo;without merit,&rdquo; with Seagal adding that he is &ldquo;outraged.&rdquo; Still, Arpaio and Seagal haven&rsquo;t actually disputed anything related to the excessiveness of the raid or the resulting property damage&mdash;only the dog-slaughter charge, to which Arpaio responded, &ldquo;If my deputies&mdash;or posse man Seagal for that matter&mdash;had done something so awful like shooting a family dog, then where are the photos to prove it?&rdquo; Of course, Llovera&rsquo;s attorney pointed out that the letter does not explicitly accuse Seagal of personally shooting his dog, only that he wants an apology for orchestrating the events that led to his dog being killed in the ensuing destruction, all so Seagal&rsquo;s reality TV show would have a properly exciting Arizona episode.

The dog was not injured. Knox County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office deputies at 9:27 p.m. Monday responded to a commercial building at 9133 Oak Ridge Highway on a prowler call, records show. The building is vacant. According to a report filed by Deputy Brian Rehg, deputies found &ldquo;a vehicle parked behind the building and the back door to the building was standing open.&rdquo; When the unspecified number of officers at the scene announced they were with the Sheriff&rsquo;s Office, &ldquo;a large pit bull came charging at the officers from around a corner,&rdquo; Rehg wrote in the report. &ldquo;Officers fired several times at the dog striking two windows, a door and a wall,&rdquo; Rehg wrote. The dog&rsquo;s owner, Henry Johnson Bright, 52, told officers the pit bull &ldquo;only had a scratch&rdquo; and was not hurt, according to Rehg&rsquo;s report. Sheriff&rsquo;s Office Capt. Tom Cox, who oversees the Office of Professional Standards, said the involved deputies were not required to file a firearms discharge report on the incident. Such reports, Cox said, are mandated only when an officer uses a firearm in a human confrontation. The discharge reports, Cox said, mainly are used by the FBI in compiling use of force data involving confrontations between law enforcement officers and the public. Cox was unsure, based on Rehg&rsquo;s report, how many deputies fired their .40-caliber semi-automatic handguns or how many rounds were discharged. Rehg&rsquo;s report states the shots did about $600 worth of damage to the building. It was unclear if the Sheriff&rsquo;s Office will have to reimburse the property owner. Rehg has been with the Sheriff&rsquo;s Office since 2003. He was placed in the patrol division in 2006. Knox County Sheriff Jimmy &ldquo;J.J.&rdquo; Jones stripped Rehg and four others of their police powers in October 2011 after the deputies engaged in a &ldquo;dizzy bat&rdquo; game with an alleged traffic offender. In that incident, Rehg initially made the 1 a.m. traffic stop on East Emory Road, accusing the 19-year-old driver of speeding, reckless driving and drag racing. Other deputies joined the traffic stop. Deputies decided if the driver could perform a &ldquo;dizzy bat&rdquo; prank, they would drop some of the charges. One deputy produced a baseball bat. The male driver put his forehead on the bat and ran around the bat until dizzy. Then the driver had to run around a deputy&rsquo;s cruiser and touch its four corners. Authorities learned of the incident because the male driver has a relative employed by the Knoxville Police Department. Jones in April 2013 opted to reinstate the deputies&rsquo; police powers, making them available for road patrol duties when an opening occurred.

Shelby Gosa said her family called the Rock Island County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department around 6:30 a.m. Monday after seeing two, unknown Rottweiler dogs trying to get into her next-door neighbor&rsquo;s rabbit hutch. Gosa said she and her father led the deputy to the pair of dogs. One of the dogs had a collar, the other did not. She said she pet both of them, and neither one was growling while she was outside. &ldquo;The officer managed to get the dog with the collar into his car pretty easily, but the other one was giving him some trouble. It was pacing around, it kept walking back to our neighbor&rsquo;s rabbit hutch; it wouldn&rsquo;t get in the car,&rdquo; said Gosa. Still, Gosa said she assumed everything would be fine, and she and her father went back inside the house. &ldquo;A couple minutes later, we heard a gunshot,&rdquo; said Gosa. &ldquo;When I came back outside and I saw the blood in the dog&rsquo;s mouth, I immediately assumed it had bit the officer, but he told me that it didn&rsquo;t, and I was really, really confused as to why this officer would think that shooting a dog is a good idea.&rdquo; We don&rsquo;t know exactly what happened while Gosa was inside the house. Tuesday afternoon, News Eight requested an incident report from the Sheriff&rsquo;s Department. It is expected back sometime this week. Rock Island County Sheriff Jeff Boyd was out of town Tuesday, but he told News Eight that he believes the deputy acted within policy and that the dog was acting viciously at the time. Boyd said any such incident, though, raises questions, and it will be looked into further. Gosa hopes that follow-up will bring her more answers. &ldquo;It was very heartbreaking, because we have a dog, and I can&rsquo;t imagine her being shot and losing her, she&rsquo;s part of our family,&rdquo; said Gosa. Gosa said she plans to file an official complaint with the Sheriff&rsquo;s Department. &ldquo;We really wish they&rsquo;d have another way to get a dog under control rather than putting a bullet in it,&rdquo; said the dog&rsquo;s owner, Kitty Smith. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re extremely hurt, he&rsquo;s a family pet, he never caused anybody harm. It&rsquo;s just wrong,&rdquo; she said. Fisher was an 80-pound rottweiler who was shot by the deputy after a call over two dogs on the loose in rural East Moline. The caller said the dogs were attacking a rabbit hutch. His owners say Fisher was not mean. The deputy told higher-ups that the dog became aggressive while he was trying to corral him into his squad car. The Smiths say they don&rsquo;t understand why Animal Control wasn&rsquo;t called to handle the situation. &ldquo;They let my dog lay there and bleed to death, instead of putting it out of his misery. Completely inhumane and cruel. It&rsquo;s not possible he was aggressive. The owners of the home were playing with my dog, they were petting him. The cops just didn&rsquo;t take the time to get him,&rdquo; Smith said. But Capt. Gerry Bustos said the deputy said the dog became aggressive, and the deputy believed he was in real or perceived danger. Bustos said Animal Control wasn&rsquo;t on duty at the time because it was early in the morning. Capt. Bustos said there is an internal investigation into a portion of the shooting. &ldquo;We are doing an administrative review to find out why the animal wasn&rsquo;t put down earlier than it was after the initial shot,&rdquo; Bustos said. The following is the statement from the owner on their Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/justiceforfisher/info?tab=page_info: Justice For Fisher is a page that is dedicated to Fisher, a Rottweiler that was shot on June 16th, 2014 by Deputy Eric Shaver of the Rock Island County , Illinois Sheriffs Department. The deputy who shot Fisher was cleared within 24 hours by simply stating that the dog was acting aggressive. However, there is eye witness statements as well as video that clearly contradict the deputies claims. There is more to this as well. Not only was Fisher unjustly shot(which did not kill him) he was then taken to the local animal shelter and euthanized without consent nor medical help. Through this page we are trying to seek justice for the family as well as for Fisher. Also we are hoping that these senseless shootings stop claiming the lives of our family pets.

Neighbors tell FOX 25 a police officer shot the dog to death for no reason, pointing the gun at it from inside the squad car. We first reported this case Saturday, when Carol Nix told us what she saw. She said the dog was not aggressive or bothering anyone when the officers came and killed it. &quot;I said &#039;you just shot him?&#039; and he said &#039;oh yeah,&#039;&quot; Nix said Saturday.While the internal investigation continues, the department told us it could not comment. But Chief David Edwards said not everyone in the neighborhood agreed with Nix&#039;s account. There are only three other families that live on the block. We spoke with one of those families Monday. &quot;Well, I started crying because it upset me,&quot; Janie Pettit said. Pettit thinks she was the only one who saw the shooting first hand. Pettit said she watched from her front door as the squad car pulled up to confront the dog. Others came outside after the gun shot. &quot;I thought he was going to try to talk to the dog or something but he didn&#039;t he just shot the dog and the dog ran,&quot; she said. Investigators questioned Pettit Monday morning. Pettit said she told police in her statement the shooting was not justified. &quot;He shouldn&#039;t have shot it. He shouldn&#039;t have shot it because it didn&#039;t pose a threat. It wasn&#039;t threatening to anybody,&quot; Pettit said. Animal rights group, Citizens Against Animal Cruelty, out of Norman, have found the dog&#039;s owner, Jr. Ramos. &quot;He&#039;s devastated. He does not understand why they shot his dog,&quot; the group&#039;s director Jenny Patten said. Patten is upset too. &quot;This is basically a breed-specific murder. If that had been a collie, a lab, that wouldn&#039;t have happened, but being a pit bull, it was his death sentence,&quot; she said. Patten hopes this investigation will lead to disciplinary action and change. She wants officers to receive training on how to deal with dogs at large. Patten and her group are also helping Ramos fight a citation officers issued to Ramos. He said he had just gotten off work on Friday to come home and discover his dog got loose. After searching around Anadarko for about an hour, he got to the neighborhood just in time to see his dog shot. While carrying his dead dog, he said officers lectured him about the breed, then wrote him ticket for having a dog at large. &quot;We will go to court with him. There are three or four of us who will be in court with him and stand up for what happened to this dog. It&#039;s wrong,&quot; Patten said. Police said the investigation should be wrapped up by the end of the week. ANADARKO - The neighbors who live on one block in Anadarko are upset about the death of a dog on their street. They said police officers shot a pit bull that had gotten loose and roamed their block Friday afternoon. Carol Nix said she was home on Friday when her dogs started to bark. She checked outside and saw the pit bull laying by a dumpster at the end of the street. &quot;I thought something must be wrong because he just kept staying in the same spot and wouldn&#039;t leave. So I walked down to see what was going on,&quot; she said. Nix said the dog was fine, but every time she tried to approach it, it would walk away. She said it was a sweet dog. &quot;This dog was not aggressive. This dog gave you no reason to be afraid,&quot; Nix said. Nix said she went back inside her house, checking on the dog every once in a while. &quot;I was in the house, on the computer and I heard a loud gun shot out the front door and I just knew that someone had shot him,&quot; Nix said. She said two Anadarko police officers in a squad car had pulled up and used a shotgun on the dog. She said she could see several exits wounds from the buck shots. &quot;Senseless, you know? If the dog had attacked someone or acted aggressively than I think I maybe can understand that, but discharging a shotgun in a residential area for a dog that didn&#039;t do anything except bark, and not at anyone in particular, is just ridiculous,&quot; she said. Nix said the dog&#039;s owner had been driving around looking for his dog when he arrived in front of her home, just a few minutes too late. She said the dog had already been shot and ran off behind an abandoned home when it&#039;s owner drove up. &quot;I heard him say &#039;can I get my dog?&#039; and he ran behind the house and in just a couple of minutes he came back carrying the dog and blood was just, it was gruesome. There was just blood everywhere,&quot; she said. The dog died a short time later. Nix wants answers about why police would pull the trigger. &quot;This man, who I don&#039;t know, lost his dog, his pet, his friend, as he said his baby, for no reason.&quot; The Anadarko Police Department said no one was available Saturday who could give a statement. We were told to talk with the police chief on Monday.

After a brief pursuit, Gonzalez pulled alongside the highway and emerged from his car, saying, &quot;He&#039;s dying.&quot; &quot;Who&#039;s dying?

The incident took place on Dec. 2 at the 15700 block of Brandiron Street when deputies were serving a warrant to 24-year-old Jared Smith for assault with a deadly weapon. Detective Lori-Ann Wells told Patch that deputies shot at the dog after it attacked, though no deputies were injured. Smith&#039;s ex-girlfriend and co-owner of the dog, Brianna Fox, told Patch that the reports of an attack are false, saying that Jimbo, the 2-year-old pit bull mix, didn&#039;t even &quot;take two steps&quot; toward the officers. &quot;He didn&#039;t bark or anything,&quot; Fox told Patch. &quot;He had a tennis ball in his mouth. It&#039;s not like he ran out.&quot; Fox said the deputies told her they can&#039;t wait for &quot;every dog to bite or lick,&quot; which is why they shot without hesitation. According to Fox, Smith was inside a motorhome parked next to her house with a friend and the dog, Jimbo. She says she knew Smith, who was arrested on probable cause for the outstanding felony warrant, possession of a deadly weapon, spousal abuse and vandalism, was there and that the two raised the dog together. &quot;There was a huge helicopter flying close ot the house... so we all came outside,&quot; Fox said. &quot;Jimbo stopped, looked at the officers and then back at Jared. And then they shot.&quot; Fox&#039;s adoptive mother, Goldie Charlene Fox, who goes by Charlene, witnessed the whole thing. &quot;I got up and stuck my head out, opened the front door and to my right come two officers with shotguns, running as fast as they could,&quot; Charlene said. &quot;The shots just blew him over.&quot; Charlene told Patch that deputies ran onto the property from all directions without warning. Though she couldn&#039;t see Jimbo as he was being shot, she said he never barked or growled. &quot;It&#039;s an awful, awful thing,&quot; Charlene said. &quot;I know they&#039;re doing their job, but they came in here like [Smith] was a mass murderer.&quot; Charlene says she doesn&#039;t know who made a phone call to the sheriff&#039;s department to tip them off that Smith might be on her property. Detective Wells told Patch that deputies visited the home after receiving a call at 7:58 a.m. about a suspicious person. Charlene said Jimbo didn&#039;t have an aggressive personality and was a &quot;real character&quot; that got along with her five dogs. &quot;That dog would&#039;ve never charged. He was the sweetest... absolutely the best dog,&quot; she said. Fox got Jimbo cremated, at the urging of Charlene. &quot;I took him to get cremated because he was not recognizable,&quot; Fox said. &quot;The vet that examined him said that he got shot at least five times... and that he was not facing [the deputies] when he got shot.&quot; What do the Foxes hope to get out of this? Charlene said she wants animals to be &quot;treated fairly&quot; and Fox said she wants to see the department policy changed in the course of all of this. &quot;I think it&#039;s completely appropriate to tranquilize a dog,&quot; Fox said, as opposed to shooting them to control situation. &quot;Move them out of the way and move on to the suspect or whoever you&#039;re dealing with. It will save a bunch of lives and a bunch of heartbreak.&quot; Patch put an inquiry in to the sheriff&#039;s department regarding their policy on handling dogs during these situations, but as of publication, has not received a response. Fox wants to pursue legal action for tighter restrictions and compensation on Jimbo&#039;s cremation, but is having a hard time finding someone to be her ally. &quot;I&#039;m trying,&quot; Fox said of finding a lawyer. &quot;All of the attorneys that I&#039;ve spoken to don&#039;t want to deal with it.&quot; Editor&#039;s note: Pictures of Jimbo from the vet were posted to the original story here, but were deemed too graphic by the Ramona Patch editor and subsequently taken down.','http://patch.com/california/ramona/owner-of-killed-pitbull-mix-says-sheriff-s-department#photo-12464130','Jimbo','Unknown SWAT team','0','0',2,0,0,0,0,'Uniform',1,2,0,0,2,0),(1202,'2012-12-06','California','Pico Rivera','Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department, LA Sheriffs Homicide Bureau',1,2,1,'Unconfirmed','A deputy shot and killed a pit bull Thursday in a residential neighborhood, apparently grazing a fellow deputy with his gunfire, officials said.\r\nThe incident was reported shortly after noon in the 8700 block of West Boulevard, Deputy Guillermina Saldana of the Los Angeles County Sheriff&rsquo;s Headquarter&rsquo;s Bureau said.

Some residents said the shooting was unnecessary, but others are coming to the defense of police, who say they had no choice but to fire because the animal was a public safety threat. &ldquo;Basically, they agitated and frightened a cornered cat before they killed her,&rdquo;  Madeline Bernstein, president of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Los Angeles, told CBS2 News. &ldquo;Deadly force should be used only as a last resort. The citizens and wildlife of California deserve better.&rdquo; Others disagree. Madelyn Tarfman, 70, said she was sad the cat was killed but supported the shooting. The Santa Monica resident said she feared for the young children attending preschool across the street. &quot;We feel bad,&quot; she said. &quot;But when there is a choice between an animal and people, then you have to make a decision.&quot; With news choppers circling overhead, Santa Monica police managed to corner the 3-year-old lion in the courtyard of an office complex. Police said they made several attempts to contain what they described as an aggressive feline using tranquilizing darts, nonlethal bullets and a fire hose. When that failed to stop the lion from trying to escape, a police officer fatally shot the animal. Authorities defended the killing, saying the cat would have posed a public threat if it had managed to get back on the street. They noted that in addition to the children at the preschool, there were shoppers nearby. &quot;A variety of means were used to try to keep the animal back in the courtyard,&quot; said Santa Monica Police Lt. Robert Almada. &quot;The animal continued to charge and attempted to flee. It was euthanized to protect the public safety.&quot; But in a city known for its robust civic discord and love of causes, some were quick to protest. Bill Dyer, 78, said police are too quick to reach for their weapons when dealing with animals. &quot;What was the rush?&quot; asked Dyer, a regional director for In Defense of Animals, a nonprofit animal protection organization. &quot;They should have taken their time.

The male cat, estimated to be 2 to 3 years old, sparked alarm after it was first reported by early-morning dog walkers and a delivery man around Rinconada Park -- less than a mile from Highway 101 and far from the foothills that the big cats normally call home. Given the highly populated setting, police and wildlife officials said, a police officer was given the OK to shoot the cat at 1:09 p.m. Authorities stressed that attempting to subdue it with a tranquilizer dart would have been too risky because it can take half an hour for the drugs to take effect. &quot;You&#039;re just putting more people at risk if you tranquilize a lion and it takes off,&quot; said state Department of Fish and Game spokesman Steve Martarano, whose agency approved a permit to kill the lion as a public safety threat. &quot;It usually takes at least 20 or 30 minutes for the tranquilizing drugs to take effect. At that point, (the cougar) can be highly unpredictable,&quot; Martarano said. &quot;That&#039;s why we don&#039;t as a policy tranquilize lions to remove them.&quot; He added simply: &quot;Lions are very difficult to catch.&quot; The animal &quot;was a huge threat to public safety,&quot; and what would happen if a tranquilizer was used was just too unpredictable, said Palo Alto police Detective Kara Apple. &quot;It was lunchtime for nearby elementary schools, and students were going to be getting out shortly.&quot;\r\nDuveneck and Walter Hays elementary schools are near popular Rinconada Park, which also includes the city&#039;s community center and Junior Museum and Zoo.\r\nThe lion killing capped a morning of anxious drama for suburban residents unused to big-game hunts. It began about 4:45 a.m. when a delivery man reported the puma on Coleridge Avenue in the city&#039;s most exclusive neighborhood -- Old Palo Alto, which is home to former 49ers great Steve Young and Apple Computer founder Steve Jobs. Somehow, the wayward cat crossed busy Embarcadero Road, and an hour later a couple walking their dog reported a mountain lion &quot;the size of a German shepherd walking down the sidewalk,&quot; Detective Apple said, before it vanished into the bushes at Cedar Street and Parkinson Avenue. Palo Alto police called officers in on overtime, and a yard-by-yard search was conducted. Patrol officers from five surrounding communities helped out, and a California Highway Patrol plane buzzed overhead. Duveneck Elementary School Principal Ruth Malen was notified by the associate school superintendent at 6:15 a.m. that a mountain lion had been spotted in the neighborhood near the school. When she arrived at the school, a police officer and patrol car were parked in front, standing guard over the school grounds. At the direction of the police, Malen asked the staff to keep all of the children inside their classrooms for morning recess, and physical education classes were held in the school&#039;s multipurpose room. At lunchtime, children were allowed to eat and play near their classrooms but were called back in after another sighting.\r\nThe final chapter began just past noon, when gardeners entering the backyard of a home on Newell Road near Channing Avenue saw the cougar cut through the yard and leap a fence. About 20 minutes later, John and Linda Furrier&#039;s 2-year-old son, Tyler, and 3-year-old daughter, Caroline, were playing in the backyard and open garage on Walter Hays Drive when their 11-year-old black Labrador retriever, Kelsey, began growling ferociously, making a noise the couple had never heard. Soon afterward, the Lab darted after something down the street. John Furrier followed the dog outside, where cruising animal-control officers warned: &quot;Your dog&#039;s out, and there&#039;s a mountain lion loose in the neighborhood.&quot; What no one realized at the time was that dog had driven the cougar up a tree in the next-door neighbor&#039;s front yard.\r\nNobody saw the mountain lion until 40 minutes later, when CBS 5 TV reporter Len Ramirez said he looked up in a 20-foot camphor tree and &quot;saw this big cat sleeping peacefully in a tree, like something in a National Geographic special.&quot; &quot;In my calmest voice, I told my cameraman, &#039;Bob, look up,&#039; and pointed at the tree,&quot; Ramirez recounted. The reporter then notified a patrol officer parked under the tree -- unaware that his quarry was overhead.\r\n&quot;The cop looked up and had this surprised look, like &#039;Oh!&#039; -- and then he radioed it in,&quot; Ramirez said. A police officer armed with an AR-15 rifled arrived within seconds as the lion appeared to stir, rising into a crouch. The officer, a woman police wouldn&#039;t identify, fired one shot, hitting the cat in the midsection. &quot;Oh, my God!&quot; a neighbor screamed as the lion clung briefly to the limb before falling to the ground. It ran onto the front lawn of a neighboring home, then collapsed and died. In a surreal scene, neighbors spoke with a mixture of nervous humor and relief as the Furriers&#039; toddlers played on a swing dangling from the tree where the cougar had been perched minutes earlier. &quot;It&#039;s very scary to have a mountain lion in a neighborhood with small kids. They&#039;re helpless against an animal that size,&quot; said John Furrier. Many residents recounted how they&#039;d unwittingly walked beneath the tree where the cat was perched during the excitement of the search. &quot;We were looking in the bushes on the ground. How stupid are we?&quot; said Lisa Mellberg, who lives across the street. Everyone praised Kelsey the Lab as a hero. &quot;Kelsey&#039;s getting steak for dinner tonight,&quot; said Linda Furrier. Apple said police, who initially were using the news media and patrols saturating neighborhoods to notify residents, were initiating a phone alert system when the lion was found and shot. Santa Clara County wildlife specialist Mike Phillips, who examined the dead lion, said it did not appear sick or hungry. Phillips suspected the young lion had been hunting along nearby San Francisquito Creek, which runs from the foothills to the bay, and probably &quot;just got disoriented&quot; and wandered into the neighborhood. A necropsy planned by Fish and Game scientists may determine whether this is the same lion that clawed and bit a horse last month in the hills behind Stanford University, Phillips said. Researchers will study the animal&#039;s stomach contents and can even compare the lion&#039;s claw and bite marks with the horse&#039;s wounds.

Charles Woolsoncroft was fired Thursday after shooting a cat with his .40-caliber service revolver Monday night at Eighth and High streets. City Administrator Larry Paine said a special Baldwin City Council meeting had just adjourned and council members were leaving city hall when Woolsoncroft shot the cat, which had been mauled by a dog. &quot;Woolsoncroft said &#039;Hold your ears. I&#039;ve got to destroy this animal,&#039;&quot; Paine said. City council members witnessed the shooting, but Paine said he was unsure if anyone else was present. He said BCPD supervisors Sgt. Colleen Larson and Cpl. Bill Dempsey were called and they immediately placed Woolsoncroft on paid administrative leave. &quot;That is a normal course of action when there&#039;s a discharge of a firearm,&quot; Paine said of the administrative leave decision. Larson referred all questions to Paine. Paine said the decision to fire Woolsoncroft was made after it was discovered the three-year BCPD officer hadn&#039;t followed proper procedure outlined in the police department policy manual regarding the discharge of firearms pertaining to animals. In the case of an injured animal, Paine said policy states the supervisor must be contacted, the animal must be taken to a veterinarian and, if necessary, the veterinarian will put the animal down. He wouldn&#039;t say if Woolsoncroft followed any of the policy&#039;s steps, but he did say the animal control truck was parked across the street and it was never used. He said he expects Woolsoncroft will appeal the termination. He has seven days from his termination to notify Paine in writing of the appeal, which will then go before the city council. He would not comment on whether Woolsoncroft had received other disciplinary action during his tenure with the BCPD or whether anything else led to the termination, but Woolsoncroft is part of a complaint filed against the city earlier this year by four BCPD officers as a result of the treatment they faced regarding disciplinary action taken against them. Woolsoncroft declined to comment but said he will appeal the termination. He referred all questions to his attorney, Dennis Hawver. Hawver said Woolsoncroft&#039;s termination was not about shooting the cat. Instead, he said it stems from last year&#039;s termination of former Baldwin officer G.H. Rhea that eventually led to an investigation of the entire police department. He said Woolsoncroft did receive a suspension earlier this year as part of the disciplinary action taken against BCPD officers. &quot;This has been a long, tedious, heartbreaking process where the city administrator, the mayor and the city council decided they were going to terminate Chuck,&quot; Hawver said. &quot;Chuck is a good officer. I&#039;m very angry with the way they&#039;ve treated him.&quot; He said Woolsoncroft acted properly when he shot the cat. &quot;Chuck didn&#039;t do anything wrong. He didn&#039;t take out his nightstick and beat it to death,&quot; he said. &quot;He had to make an on-the-spot decision, which I think is a humane and reasonable decision. &quot; Hawver said there is no written procedure to follow and Woolsoncroft felt he was making the best decision. &quot;He faces circumstances that most of us don&#039;t have to face,&quot; he said. Paine said there is written procedure outline in the BCPD policy manual under the section regarding discharge of a firearm at an animal. In section 10.021 of the department&#039;s manual it states: &quot;In cases of seriously injured livestock, dogs and cats; all reasonable efforts should be made to locate the animal&#039;s owner. If the owner cannot be located, arrangements should be made to have a veterinarian examine the animal and advise the appropriate action. Should an injured animal need to be destroyed, such action should be taken by a veterinarian whenever possible. Seriously injured wildlife may be destroyed if no other reasonable alternatives exist and a supervisor has authorized such action.&quot; Hawver said Woolsoncroft did nothing that would require his termination. &quot;I don&#039;t think Chuck did anything wrong,&quot; he said. &quot;I do see that the city administrator did something wrong. I&#039;m sure a jury will see it too.&quot; Mayor Ken Hayes said he thought Woolsoncroft&#039;s termination was the correct decision. &quot;Discharging a fire arm into a planter box in downtown is unacceptable behavior from anyone, badge or no badge,&quot; Hayes said. &quot;The animal control vehicle and equipment was less than 150 feet away. The issue should have been dealt with in a more humane manner.&quot; Paine said Woolsoncroft&#039;s termination does not leave the police department short handed. Tara Craig, who had been sent to the police academy earlier this year, will be able to help with rotations. &quot;For the moment, we&#039;re able to fill the vacancy of the patrol officer without having the department have a lack of coverage,&quot; he said. &quot;The fact is, we&#039;ve got all the shifts covered.&quot; He said it&#039;s too soon to know if another officer will be hired.','http://signal.baldwincity.com/news/2002/oct/09/baldwin_police_officer/?print','Unknown','Charles Woolsoncroft','1','0',2,0,0,0,0,'Uniform',3,3,1,1,0,0),(1208,'2014-05-27','Colorado','Littleton','Littleton Police Department',1,10,0,'Bobcat','The following is reproduced from the Littleton Independent: Littleton police shot a rabid bobcat, May 27, on New Estate Road after it attacked several farm animals on the property. According to Deputy Chief Matthew King, officer Brian Casey responded to a report that a bobcat was attacking a horse on 175 New Estate Road, around 5 p.m. The house has a garage with a barn in the back, containing three goats and a horse stable. When Casey arrived, he saw a &quot;very large&quot; bobcat acting aggressively in the front yard of the property. The bobcat ran to the side of the house and began scratching the door, trying to get into the residency. Although Casey was not aware at that point, the bobcat had bitten the family&rsquo;s horse under its eye, to the point where the horse was almost blinded, according to King.\r\nAfter a radio call for further assistance, Officer Michael Crory and Sgt. Matthew Pinard arrived at the scene, and the two went on the opposite sides of the house, trying to find the bobcat. &quot;We instantly knew something was wrong,&quot; said Crory. &quot;When the bobcat saw us, it should have been spooked, should have run away.&quot; The two officers searched the garage and the perimeter of the house, but couldn&rsquo;t find anything. &quot;But the horse still looked spooked, so we knew the cat was still around,&quot; said Crory. Crory said he checked the front entrance of the barn, which contained three goats, near the horse stalls, and at first didn&rsquo;t see anything. But after he left the barn, Crory heard three growls that he described as &quot;cat-like.&quot; Two seconds later, he said, the 50-pound bobcat was standing around 10 feet away from the officers. &quot;I said, &lsquo;there it is,&rsquo; and knew I needed to take a shot at it,&quot; said Crory. &quot;If I missed, it would have gotten away.&quot; Crory proceeded to shoot and kill the bobcat, which he described as an adult, around four feet long. The officers called animal control and searched the perimeter for any further damage. They found that one of the goats had been bitten. King said the deceased bobcat tested positive for rabies. &quot;In all my years in this town, I&rsquo;ve never seen a bobcat act like that,&quot; said King. &quot;It was strange.&quot; &quot;There were children playing outside across the street and next door,&quot; he added.

The Idaho Department of Fish and Game has been working to find the cat since Friday when it first appeared in the Warm Springs Mesa neighborhood. On Monday morning, a cyclist reported seeing the mountain lion on the Friendship Bridge over the Boise River near Julia Davis Park. Police found and shot the 70-pound juvenile male around midnight on Monday after it was seen feeding in a dumpster about 200 yards away from Bronco Stadium. They shot it as it was walking across the Greenbelt. Fish and Game officials believe this is the same cat that was seen picking at a deer carcass in the front yard of an east Boise home Friday night. Fish and Game officers now have the mountain lion&#039;s body.

Police were called at about 8:30 p.m. to the area near 112th and Queen Avenue near Nine Mile Creek, where officers saw the cougar lying in underbrush just off the trail, said Jim Ryan, a patrol commander for the Bloomington Police. &quot;They threw some sticks and things at it,&quot; Ryan said, trying to scare it off, &quot;but it still doesn&#039;t take off.&quot; The cat&#039;s standoffish attitude in a populated area prompted the officers to shoot it, Ryan said. They shot from about 30 yards away using a .223-caliber rifle. Thursday&#039;s incident took place about 1&frac12; miles from a spot south of the Minnesota River in Savage where a Cargill employee took several photos of a mountain lion in early April. Since 1999, Ryan said, Bloomington police have responded to about 10 mountain lion sightings. &quot;We don&#039;t run out and shoot every cougar that we see,&quot; Ryan said. &quot;What made this unique was the inaction by the cougar.&quot; The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources picked up the animal for testing on Friday and transferred it to the University of Minnesota. Tests will be done to determine its age and health. A cursory exam by DNR personnel on Friday showed no obvious signs that the cat had been in captivity, said Ed Boggess, manager of the DNR&#039;s wildlife resources division. The cat sported a full set of claws and still had its large canine teeth &mdash; things that private owners sometimes have removed. Bill Berg, a retired DNR specialist on predators, said the researchers would likely analyze the animal&#039;s stomach and fecal contents to see what it was eating. He added that he never heard of a cougar being shot in the Twin Cities area during his 30-year career. But he received 40 to 60 credible reports of cougar sightings statewide each year, he said. The Bloomington neighborhood where the cat was shot sits above Nine Mile Creek and the north side of the Minnesota River Valley. Cougars can swim and the Minnesota River wouldn&#039;t have been an obstacle if it were the same cougar spotted in Savage in April, Berg said. Other Bloomington residents who live along the Minnesota River say the cougar had been in the area for at least a couple of weeks. On Monday night, Chris Fuller, who lives on the river bluffs five blocks south of the Mall of America, said he heard what he believes was a cougar killing a raccoon. The next morning Karen Fuller saw the cougar in their back yard from 15 feet away. She thinks the cat started making its appearances near their home a couple of weeks ago after she accidentally burned a pork loin. &quot;I threw it off the deck, figuring some raccoons would get it. I think the next morning the cougar was here.&quot; The cougar sighting is one more sign of the wilderness that remains in the Minnesota River Valley even as it cuts through the metro area. In the last year the Fullers have seen a bear, wild turkeys, a red fox &mdash; and now a cougar &mdash; in their yard. &quot;We keep the camcorder handy all the time,&quot; Karen Fuller said, although they didn&#039;t capture the cougar on tape. Berg said he&#039;s reluctant to pass judgment on the way Bloomington police handled the cougar Thursday night. Tranquilizing a cougar isn&#039;t always a quick fix either, he said. In the early 1980s a 150-pound cougar was tranquilized near Worthington. &quot;We didn&#039;t really know what to do with it. We didn&#039;t want to re-release it in the state because of liability problems,&quot; he said. After the cat had boarded for a couple of months at a game facility, the state of Colorado reluctantly agreed to take it. &quot;We didn&#039;t do that cat any favor because once it&#039;s in a strange area,&quot; Berg said, &quot;another cougar will come and kill it.&quot;','http://www.cougarnet.org/minnesota6-2-02.htm','Unknown','Unknown','1','0',0,0,0,3,3,'Uniform',3,3,0,0,0,0),(1211,'2014-11-17','Oregon','Medford','Medford Police Department, Oregon State Police Fish and Wildlife Division',1,100,0,'Black Bear','An old black bear given a one-day chance to leave a southwest Medford neighborhood on its own was shot and killed by police Monday morning near a school because it was deemed a public-safety threat. It was the second bear this fall killed by police near grade schools in west Medford in what state wildlife biologists say is a busy year for local nuisance bears. Medford police shot a black bear under similar circumstances Sept. 25 near Washington Elementary School off Peach Street. The latest bear was discovered about 7 a.m. Sunday when Louise Abel&#039;s neighbor knocked on her door to tell her there was a bear high in a pine tree in her backyard in the 1500 block of Jasper Street. Abel called Medford police, who, after consulting with Oregon State Police Fish and Wildlife Division troopers, decided to back off and keep the area clear in hopes the bear would wander away on its own, police said. &quot;I opened up my gates and turned the back light off,&quot; Abel said. The 180-pound female bear instead climbed down the tree and bedded down in backyard brush about 50 yards from a popular walking route to nearby Jefferson Elementary School, police said. The sow was discovered there by an officer at 4:30 a.m. Monday. After consultation with OSP troopers and an Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife biologist, police considered the bear&#039;s proximity to school too risky to leave there, police said. A Medford police sergeant shot and killed the bear at 5:30 a.m., and the carcass was given to ODFW biologists who will donate the meat to charity, police said. &quot;The police were amazing,&quot; Abel said. &quot;They really didn&#039;t want to shoot it.&quot; Law enforcement officials have the discretion to shoot wildlife in city limits if the animal is deemed a threat, Vargas said.\r\n &quot;Their call was fine,&quot; Vargas said. &quot;I have no issues with the public-safety call they made.&quot; Bears wandering into city limits is a rather common occurrence in Southern Oregon, often with the bears coming and going without anyone noticing. Those that stick around often end up with death sentences because tranquilizing and relocating bears has a poor track record, Vargas said. Relocated bears often exhibit the same behavior in their new haunts, so it just shifts any conflict from one community to another, he said. Or, the bears turn around and come back. The last time Vargas attempted to trap and relocate an urban bear was in 2009, when a young bear was discovered in a tree at the playground of Medford&#039;s Lone Pine Elementary School just as kids entered their classrooms. That bear was tranquilized and trucked to far northeastern Klamath County. It then covered 78 air miles over the Cascade Mountains in 10 days before it was shot legally by a hunter about 1.5 miles from the east Medford school. &quot;When we get the urban bears that are habituated to people, they come back,&quot; Vargas said. &quot;There&#039;s no way around it. They come back.&quot; Generally only injured or completely wayward cubs &mdash; like the one found last month wandering the aisles of a Rite Aid store in Ashland &mdash; are candidates for tranquilizing and relocating to zoos or other centers, Vargas said. Vargas said the bear shot Monday was an old female that could be as much as 10 years old based on how worn her teeth were.\r\nThe female was not lactating, so it did not have any cubs, Vargas said. It also had healthy amounts of fat, he said. Abel said the bear could have been in her yard as early as Friday evening, when her normally night-roving cat Xeno refused to go outside. &quot;The cat must have sensed it because he was pretty nervous,&quot; she said. The bear could have followed irrigation canals into town, then wandered down an alley that stops near Abel&#039;s back fence.\r\nVargas said it is less than one aerial mile from the Pioneer Road area that is very bear-rich. Southern Oregon has some of the country&#039;s highest black bear densities and human interactions with them are cyclic. This year seems to be a busy one, with nuisance complaints up, hunter-killed numbers high and a dozen road-killed bears, Vargas said.','http://www.mailtribune.com/article/20141117/News/141119669','Unknown','Unknown','1','0',1,0,0,3,3,'Uniform',1,3,0,0,0,0),(1212,'2014-09-25','Oregon','Medford','Medford Police Department',1,100,0,'Black Bear','It was the second bear this fall killed by police near grade schools in west Medford in what state wildlife biologists say is a busy year for local nuisance bears.

The incident comes at the end of a year with a record number of wildlife rabies incidents in Arizona, with 16 cases in Yavapai County. The Arizona Game and Fish Department reported that Yavapai County had eight cases of known rabies in foxes and three in bobcats. &quot;Animal control received the original call Tuesday night that there was a bobcat attacking vehicles in this same area,&quot; Prescott Police Sgt. Tim Fletcher said. Prescott police and City of Prescott Animal Control officers Wednesday morning went to search the area across the street from The Cottages subdivision near The Daily Courier newspaper office. While they were checking along the parkway, they saw a bobcat walking toward them. &quot;She walked toward us and stopped, and just stood there staring at us,&quot; Fletcher said. &quot;She never ran and didn&#039;t act like she was healthy. She just stood there.&quot; The cat eventually walked into a wooded area near Prescott Lakes Parkway and Willow Lake Road. Police and animal control officers followed the cat and found her sitting near a tree. Fletcher said that he decided to shoot the cat because it showed abnormal behavior by roaming in daylight, not showing fear of humans, and it appeared sickly, which are symptoms of rabies. No one could be sure if it is the same bobcat that attacked cars the night before, but based on the cat&#039;s behavior and the fact police found it in the same area, it is likely the same one, Fletcher said. Officer Jeremy Brazell got within 15 yards of the cat and killed it with one shot from an AR-15 rifle. &quot;We decided that was a safe place to do it because we had a good backdrop and it is in an unpopulated area,&quot; Fletcher said. Scott Poppenberger, of the Arizona Game and Fish Department, said that he would send the carcass to a lab for &quot;disease testing.&quot; Poppenberger said that he should know the test results in about 24 hours.  &quot;The good thing is, as far as we know it had no known exposure to people or other animals,&quot; Poppenberger said. &quot;But, we need to determine if it is diseased based on its behavior and because it exhibited a number of signs that it is diseased.&quot; Poppenberger added that bobcats are a &quot;high risk for rabies&quot; because of their interaction with other wildlife. The most recent case of a rabid bobcat encounter, and one of the most dramatic, occurred mid-December about four miles from Castle Hot Springs. James Gruver strangled to death a rabid bobcat after it lunged from under Gruver&#039;s sand buggy trailer and attacked him. &quot;People need to realize that we live in a rural area with a lot of wildlife around,&quot; Fletcher said. &quot;It&#039;s one of the reasons that we live here, but we have to remember that they are wild animals.&quot;','http://dcourier.com/main.asp?SectionID=1&amp;subsectionID=1&amp;articleID=76183','Unknown','Jeremy Brazell','1','0',2,0,0,3,3,'Uniform',3,3,0,0,0,0),(1214,'2014-10-18','Texas','Lubbock','Lubbock Police Department',2,2,1,'Unconfirmed','Lubbock resident Marion Bowden said police shot and killed two dogs after they bit him on the arm and attacked another woman on the face early Saturday morning. &ldquo;I was (inside) when this happened and I heard somebody screaming.

When her dad asked why, she replied: &quot;They killed a dog.&quot; It happened Jan. 13. The four-legged suspect, named Bugsy, was loose, and the cops said it attacked them. They nailed Bugsy after firing more than 20 shots. Their bullets also hit two houses and a plastic tank filled with gas. The Detroit Police Department&#039;s internal affairs unit and Office of the Chief Investigator, which handles citizen complaints, are investigating the incident, involving three officers from the 5th (Jefferson) Precinct. Claiborne, who is a Detroit firefighter, is still livid when he talks about the officers running up and down his block on Harvard and firing their guns repeatedly. One of the shots went through his front window as he was holding his daughter in the kitchen, slamming into a wall several feet from them. &quot;I still don&#039;t really know how the bullet missed us,&quot; Claiborne said. &quot;There must have been an angel in the room.&quot; His neighbors, Gerald and Candace Wheeler, surveyed the damage to their two-car garage in awe after the police killed Bugsy, a 1-year-old Neapolitan mastiff who died in an alley a block away at Grayton, near Chandler Park Drive. There are eight bullet holes in the garage. One bullet grazed the plastic handle of a full gas can inside the garage. &quot;That gas can could have easily blown up,&quot; said Gerald Wheeler. After the officers killed the dog, Wheeler said one of them approached him and nonchalantly uttered, &quot;Wow, your garage looks like a piece of Swiss cheese.&quot; &quot;I asked him, &#039;Who is going to pay for this?&#039; &quot; Wheeler said. &quot;He told me to turn it in to my insurance company.&quot; Then there&#039;s the dog&#039;s owner, Timothy Johnson, who lives on Grayton. He bought the dog as a family pet on Christmas Eve 2002 to surprise his 3-year-old daughter Jordan. Johnson said Bugsy, who was about 150 pounds, dug his way out of a kennel in the backyard while the family was out. &quot;This was really unnecessary,&quot; Johnson, 41, said. &quot;I grew up in Detroit and Highland Park and I really don&#039;t want to give the city a bad rap, but Bugsy was not a vicious dog. If the officers would have taken a little time, they could have easily found out who owned the dog.&quot; Wheeler and Claiborne attended the Feb. 26 Board of Police Commissioners meeting to air their complaints. Assistant Chief Walter Shoulders said the matter is under investigation internally. The two men subsequently filed a complaint against the three officers with the department&#039;s Office of the Chief Investigator. Arnold Sheard, the department&#039;s interim chief investigator, would not release the officers&#039; names Thursday because the investigation is ongoing. The Free Press learned one of the officers is Aaron Haley. He declined comment. Cmdr. Charles Barbieri of the 5th Precinct said the three officers were sent to a remedial firearms course after the incident, which he called standard procedure. The officers responded at 5 p.m. after a resident called police about the loose dog. &quot;I don&#039;t think it was a questionable shooting,&quot; Barbieri said. &quot;They had a vicious dog and they had to shoot it. It&#039;s fairly common. I know it did take a few shots to put the dog down.&quot; Wheeler and Claiborne counted more than 20 shell casings on the street and in their yards. &quot;It was a dog, and there are bullet holes in my garage,&quot; Candace Wheeler said. &quot;A dog! It really doesn&#039;t makes you feel too good about the police force.&quot; Johnson, the owner, said he&#039;s discussing the matter with an attorney and just wants the city to replace Bugsy. Lemuel Joyner, who lives around the corner on Grayton, said he questioned one of the officers after hearing a barrage of gunshots. &quot;He said the dog had attacked him,&quot; Joyner said. &quot;I&#039;m wondering how he was running after a dog down an alley, shooting his gun, if the dog was attacking him.&quot; Joyner said the dog had been loose at least one other time but never had attacked anyone. &quot;That dog did not have a violent bone in its body,&quot; he said. Gerald Wheeler said he can&#039;t help but wonder how this incident would have been handled in the suburbs. &quot;These officers treated it like it was nothing,&quot; he said. &quot;We never heard from them again. It&#039;s the attitude that left me with a bad feeling.&quot; NOT MENTIONED IN ARTICLE: A transcript of Gerald Wheeler&#039;s complaint before the Detroit Board of Police Commissioners is available on the PuppycideDB Datasets webpage here: https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/docs.puppycidedb.com/Detroit_Board_Police_Commissioners-Gerald_Wheeler-20040226.pdf','http://www.thehighroad.org/archive/index.php/t-71261.html','Bugsy','Aaron Haley ','1','0',1,0,0,0,2,'Uniform',3,3,2,2,2,0),(1220,'1985-05-20','Florida','Hollywood','Hollywood Police Department',1,2,1,'Unconfirmed, 2yo','A pit bull-labrador mixed breed was shot in the head after it lunged at a police officer Monday but ran away and had not been found Monday night. The noontime incident set off a scare at two nearby elementary schools. Police instructed the principals of St. Mark`s Lutheran School and Oakridge Elementary School to keep all students indoors for the rest of the day, police said. If still alive, Whiner, 2, is considered dangerous, authorities said. ``Any animal that`s injured is more of a threat, is more likely to bite,`` said Tim Keller, road supervisor for Broward County Animal Control. The owners, Susette and Tim Johnson, of 2715 Taylor St., were charged with violating the city`s leash law and ordered to appear before a county judge, police said. ``What`s worrying me is she might bite someone because she`s shot,`` Susette Johnson said. ``She wouldn`t bite anybody (before she was shot.) She`s a sweet puppy. She will threaten a man in uniform, she always has.`` Tim Johnson, who said police should not have shot his pet, planned to stay out all night looking for Whiner. The dog dug her way out of her electrified pen and jumped another fence to freedom before forcing a mail carrier into frozen submission at a neighbor`s door for 10 minutes, police said. The carrier, whom police identified as Don Woppert, was not attacked. He was rescued after a neighbor called police. The tortoise shell-colored dog jumped at a police officer who was trying to lure her into a squad car, outside the Johnsons` home, said Scott Johnson, spokesman for the Hollywood Police Department. ``We`ve had enough experience with pit bull attacks in this town that if one comes snapping and lunging at an officer he can`t be faulted for firing,`` said Tony Alderson, a spokesman for the Hollywood Police Department. The officer, who was not identified, fired once, police said. In December, Hollywood police killed two pit bulls after they killed a schnauzer. It was also in Hollywood that Michael Franklin ``Frankie`` Scarbrough was attacked by a pit bull in 1979, suffering face, ear and scalp injuries that required numerous operations. On Monday, police went to the two schools in the area to warn of the danger. At both schools, all students outside for physical education and recess were brought indoors and classroom doors closed.``At dismissal time, I told the kids to go directly home and to stay away from alleys and bushes where a dog could hide,`` said James Sweany, principal of Oakridge Elementary, about 1 1/2 miles north of where the dog wa shot. At St. Mark`s, all outdoor activities also were canceled for the day, said secretary Martha Rupprect. Students in the after school day-care program were restricted to play inside, she said. Whiner had escaped for the first time Sunday night by digging under a chain- link fence, Mrs. Johnson said. She said her husband built the fencing system around the house, which includes electrical wiring atop the fences to deter their dogs from jumping over. Besides Whiner, the Johnson`s own a pit bull, a labrador, a cat, a rabbit and two python snakes. Their pit bull, Husky, bit a next-door neighbor two years ago, she said, and they were sued. The case was settled with the Johnson`s insurance company, which dropped their homeowners insurance. She said they have been unable to get another company to cover them.','http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1985-05-21/news/8501200435_1_pit-bull-police-officer-hollywood-police-department','Whiner','unknown','2','2',1,0,0,1,1,'Uniform',3,3,2,0,2,0),(1221,'2013-10-07','Ohio','Goshen','Goshen Police Department',3,2,0,'Unconfirmed','The following article is reproduced from Cincinnati NBC affiliate WLWT: GOSHEN TOWNSHIP, Ohio &mdash;Police are investigating an incident in Goshen Township.

Officials report that 27-year-old Steven James Loope got into a verbal fight with his roommate and another mutual friend, retrieved a handgun and fired off multiple shots inside of his home. The two victims were able to escape the house without any injuries. When deputies arrived and ordered Loope out of the house, a pit bull attacked officers, and was shot and killed. Loope had two felony warrants out for his arrest for controlled substance-delivery and manufacture of Psilocybin (psychedelic mushrooms), and the delivery and manufacture of marijuana. During a search, a stolen .45 handgun was located, hidden in the suspect&#039;s bedroom that matched the description of the weapon used during the assault.  Spent .45 casings along with other evidence and narcotics were also located during the search. The Benzie County Prosecutor issued felony warrants for weapons-firearms-receiving and concealing, assault with a dangerous weapon, and firearm used during the commission of a felony.

Her crime: she had escaped out of her yard and come around to the front of her house. The incident happened on June 4 by the Knights of Columbus on Bernice in Center Line, Michigan, when a pit bull named Diamond made her escape. She came around to the front of the house to wait on her mom, Liz Urban, to get home from taking a few of the puppies to their new homes. Diamond wasn&#039;t bothering anyone. She wasn&#039;t wandering or acting aggressive as police claim. A neighbor, who witnessed the shooting, only called the police because she thought the dog might need help. She never dreamed the police were coming to murder a family dog I Heart Pits rescue in Detroit received a frantic call from a woman who saw the shooting take place. The witness says Diamond was laying down when CLPS arrived. She never got up and she didn&#039;t charge the officers as they claim. One of the officers fired a shot at Diamond, who then let out a loud cry and continued to whimper as she laid her head on the ground, submitting to the gunfire and pain. While lying on the ground whimpering, CLPD proceeded to shoot Mama Diamond four more times ultimately ending poor Diamonds life in her very own yard. Mama Diamond&#039;s babies are safe. They were in the home when their mother was killed, and have been crying for her ever since she left them and got out of her yard and was foolishly killed by CLPD. In all, five people witnessed the shooting. Police need to remember that just because a witness isn&#039;t visible doesn&#039;t mean they&#039;re not watching from behind a curtain inside their home. Center Line Police Department officers allegedly made a return visit to the home after murdering the family dog. A friend to Liz was at the home, and officers repeatedly asked the friend whether she knew this dog. She kept insisting yes she did. She was also on the phone with with Diamond&#039;s owner at the time and asked the officers whether they would like to speak to Diamond&#039;s owner. According to the friend, the officer refused the phone when Liz asked to speak to him, telling the friend to be quiet so the owner on the other end of the phone could hear what they were about to say. Officer&#039;s allegedly told Liz if she pursues charges she will be arrested on five felonies, which would be determined by the judge, and she will spend a guaranteed 30 days in jail. But if you say you don&#039;t know this dog and that she was a stray you will have no problems. The family is hoping those who witnessed Diamond being shot will come forward and file a report against the Center Line Police Department. That&#039;s a tough call to make, deciding to become involved against the local police department. Several recent cases where dogs were shot and killed by police report police harassment after the family got the media involved. Owner&#039;s of dogs shot by police have suffered through everything from &quot;midnight questioning&quot; on their case to being followed in their vehicle to strangers snooping on their property. Going against police can definitely create problems, even if the person involved hasn&#039;t broken any laws. In one case, the police department issued a citation for dog at large two weeks after police had shot and killed the family dog. It was thrown out by the judge because it wasn&#039;t issued at the time the incident happened. This makes many witnesses very afraid to come forward. It also makes it difficult for a family to make the decision to file charges against a local police department who murdered a member of the family. Diamond&#039;s family has already decided they will fight for justice in her murder. To follow Diamond&#039;s story, a Facebook page has been set up in her memory. A candlelight vigil is also being planned, and details will be announced on their page. Unfortunately, a necropsy can&#039;t be done because police destroyed the body, despite the wishes of the owner to have her cremated. Readers, what do you think of this case? Will police come up with the same old excuses for killing a family dog? If police were called out on a dog at large call, it could be considered negligence for officers not to have been prepared to deal with a potentially dangerous dog using a non-lethal method. That&#039;s what happened in the Santa Clara vs Hells Angels case, where members of the motorcycle group received almost $1 million for the death of three family dogs. According to the Department of Justice report on The Problem of Dog-Related Incidents and Encounters, only an insufficiently trained officer finds it necessary to kill a family dog. Perhaps these officers failed to read the article published by Law Enforcement Today warning them they could be sued for killing a family dog. Failure to properly train officers is now costing cities across the country in large settlements created when the family of a slain family dog decided to sue. Unfortunately, this may be the only method that will end family dogs being shot by police. Please note this article is based on information provided by Diamond&#039;s family and no wrong-doing by the Center Line police department has been determined at this point. UPDATED JUNE 10: A woman who read Diamond&#039;s story contacted the Center Line Police Department this morning and was not allowed to speak with anyone in charge. She was told everything online is a lie, and that police have plenty of witnesses who saw the dog attack. The concerned dog advocate was also told if she called back she would be paid a &quot;visit&quot; by police in her area. This article does not dispute the fact that Diamond may have attacked. It deals with why deadly force was used as a first defense instead of a Taser, pepper spray or catch pole. It doesn&#039;t dispute the dog may have been aggressive, as a mother dog may have been. People are more concerned on why the police saw fit to kill Diamond, then take her body, instead of coming prepared on a dog-at-large call As of yet no one has filed an official report against the department. Since an out of state caller has already been told she&#039;ll be turned in to her local police, it may prevent any witnesses from coming forward.','http://www.examiner.com/article/center-line-michigan-police-kill-nursing-mama-dog-her-own-yard?cid=PROD-redesign-right-next','Diamond','Unknown','1','0',2,0,0,2,2,'Uniform',0,2,2,2,2,2),(1225,'2014-08-31','Michigan','Livingston','Michigan State Police',2,2,0,'Unconfirmed','The following article is reproduced from the Livingston Daily and is based solely on uncorroborated police statements: Two dogs that charged an adult and teenager are dead after attempting to attack a Michigan State Police trooper investigating a complaint the dogs were killing livestock.

One animal was spotted in daylight trotting down Route 51 heading toward Baker Street. In the second sighting the animal was shot and wounded by a police officer who felt it was threatening his partner making a traffic stop on Route 51. &quot;After more discussion, we kind of thought we were looking at two different animals,&quot; says Aliquippa Chief Ralph Pallante.

Edgell, a sergeant, was attacked by what he believes was a large coyote during a traffic stop around 9:50 p.m. on Route 51 near the Aliquippa-Hopewell Township line. He credits fellow officer John Lane with saving his hide by shooting the animal through the open window of Lane&#039;s cruiser. &quot;If I&#039;d have been down there by myself on that stop, it could have been really bad for me,&quot; Edgell said. &quot;It was just a little shorter than the guardrail, that&#039;s how big that thing was.&quot;\r\nThe situation was bizarre, even by Aliquippa police standards. It began as Edgell, Lane and officer Ken Watkins were staked out along Route 51 at the Henry Mancini Memorial Bridge, looking for a suspect wanted by police in the Economy area. As the three officers were preparing to leave, a speeder zoomed by heading south. Edgell took off in pursuit. Meanwhile, a female driver stopped to tell Lane she had struck a deer minutes earlier somewhere in the area of the Ambridge-Aliquippa Bridge. She said she saw the animal flipping over on the road. Lane and Watkins headed south to back up Edgell. Lane said he was driving slowly, looking for the deer. It never occurred to him that the &quot;deer&quot; might have been the coyote reported earlier that day to Aliquippa police, who had received a report that morning of the animal feeding on a deer carcass in the vicinity of Baker Street and the Mancini Bridge. Officers spotted it, but it escaped by running behind a church on Baker Street. &quot;It was a concern because there&#039;s a lot of kids living up there on Baker Street,&quot; Lane said. As Lane and Watkins drove toward South Heights, Edgell had caught the speeder and was busy issuing him a warning. Both he and the driver, a young man, were standing on the roadside, completely unaware of what was happening just north of them. Lane and Watkins, who were approaching in separate cruisers, spotted the coyote charging toward Edgell and began yelling at him over their radios. Other motorists in both lanes of Route 51 also saw the animal and began stopping.\r\n&quot;They were yelling at me - &#039;Get out of the way! Get out of the way!&#039; - and I couldn&#039;t figure out what they were talking about,&quot; Edgell said. &quot;I couldn&#039;t see any cars coming.&quot; Edgell and the driver finally saw it. &quot;It was a dead gallop, like coming straight at me,&quot; Edgell said. &quot;That thing could have been on me before I knew it.&quot; Edgell said he pulled his weapon and told the driver to get back into his car. &quot;There were so many cars stopping,&quot; he said. &quot;I didn&#039;t have a shot.&quot; At that moment, Lane pulled up at an angle and shot the animal through his window. &quot;It yelped and reared back, then ran up into the woods,&quot; Lane said. The officers were unable to find it afterward. Edgell said he didn&#039;t have time to think of the danger while it was  happening, but afterward he realized that he could have been badly hurt - possibly killed - if not for Lane. &quot;It was only about three car lengths away from me before he shot it,&quot; Edgell said.

It happened Tuesday evening near the intersection of S. 41st and Camellia Street. Springfield police say the officer responded to calls of an aggressive dog. The officer then tried to get the dog to come to him. That&rsquo;s when police say the dog made an aggressive move towards the officer in the middle of the street. With little time to react, the officer pulled his gun and shot the dog which was just feet away. Witnesses, who didn&rsquo;t want to go on camera, offered a different report of what happened.\r\nThey say the dog was barking in her yard as the officer approached. He knelt down and that&rsquo;s when the dog started coming towards the officer. She said at no time did the dog show any signs of aggression, she was just barking.\r\nEveryone we talked with says they&rsquo;re not upset with the fact that force was used, they&rsquo;re mad about the choice of weapon. &ldquo;That was definitely overkill in this situation,&rdquo; said neighbor Brenda Brick. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel like that dog was that big of a threat at all.

Her owner say she was in critical condition at an area veterinarian&rsquo;s office Tuesday night and the bullet was lodged in her head. Sgt.

The Kimbrell family had taken custody of Mason six months before the killing. The attack occurred when David Kimbrell was &quot;disciplining&quot; his 13 year old daughter. It is unclear from news or police reports what this &quot;disciplining&quot; consisted of - if it included a beating, Mason&#039;s &quot;attack&quot; may have been a legitimate act of defense on behalf of Kimbrell&#039;s daughter. When police were called and arrived on scene, they initially attempted to hold the dog down. Mason got a second wind. The police then tried shooting Mason with a taser and missed. They finally shot the dog twice at close range. Apparently no one thought to simply place the dog in a room or outside while it calmed down.

A police report states that officer Hoyt Stepp was patrolling near the ball field at 3 a.m. when he saw the dog running loose. When Stepp followed the dog into the ball field in an attempt to impound it, he noticed Fangmeier sleeping along the field&rsquo;s east fence near the dugout. As Stepp attempted to wake Fangmeier, the dog attacked him twice, prompting him to pull his sidearm and deliver two fatal shots, according to the report &ldquo;When I woke up, my dog had been shot twice and was bleeding to death,&rdquo; said Fangmeier. The incident prompted a police investigation, and has raised the hackles of some community members who aren&rsquo;t sure that Stepp&rsquo;s actions were justified. The police report states the dog has been aggressive towards other animals in the past, but Fangmeier said he didn&rsquo;t know where the police got that information. He said that while his dog has barked and growled at other dogs, it has never resulted in injury. &ldquo;She has never been aggressive toward a human, even in situations when I&rsquo;ve been threatened, and she&rsquo;s never injured another dog, period,&rdquo; Fangmeier said. &ldquo;I find it hard to believe that she was aggressive to the point where gunshots were necessary.&rdquo; Some think Stepp should have employed a less-lethal option. &ldquo;It is unsettling to know that a trained animal control officer with other methods of restraint available shot a dog twice and let it bleed to death. This is an unfortunate incident, and it is my hope that other methods will be used before an officer draws his gun,&rdquo; said Paws and Claws president Katherine Mosely in a written statement to the News. But Dennis Spurrier, chief of police when the incident occurred, said using a gun may have been Stepp&rsquo;s only alternative. &ldquo;The officers do carry less lethal tools, but those tools are not guaranteed to neutralize a threat. The tasers have not been designed for use on animals, and some dogs don&rsquo;t react to pepper spray,&rdquo; Spurrier said. Spurrier&rsquo;s investigation into the incident found that Stepp had not violated any departmental policies or state statutes concerning the use of a firearm. &ldquo;This incident was not even remotely in violation of any of these laws,&rdquo; he said. Spurrier said Stepp&rsquo;s actions were justified, and that it was frustrating to hear community members second-guess the actions of an officer. &ldquo;There was only one person that knows what happened in the ball field that night, and I support his decision 110 percent. Given the circumstances, I would have done the same thing myself,&rdquo; Spurrier said. Though Fangmeier was in violation of city leash laws, he was not charged. Both Spurrier and Mosely said the incident could have been avoided had the dog been properly secured. &ldquo;This is a sad reminder to keep your dog under control at all times,&rdquo; Mosely said.\r\nFangmeier said he has received an outpouring of kindness from local citizens following the shooting. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m extremely thankful for all the people in the community that offered their kind words of support,&rdquo; he said.','http://www.skagwaynews.com/070904stories.html','Maggie','Hoyt Stepp','2','0',0,0,0,0,0,'Uniform',3,3,0,0,2,0),(1237,'2010-08-26','Alaska','Seward','Seward Police Department',1,100,0,'Black Bear','The following article is reproduced from Alaska Dispatch News: A shotgun round fired by Seward police to kill a black bear Thursday night pierced the animal, ricocheted and hit a bystander in the abdomen, police say.

Thursday&#039;s trouble began with reports of a black bear near the small boat harbor at about 10 p.m., according to Seward police. Officers tried and failed to shoo the bear away, police said. A crowd gathered and the bear, which apparently had been hiding, ran out, Oates said. Police shot it once with a shotgun. Soon it was running again, Oates said. The second shot killed the animal but the round didn&#039;t stop there. &quot;I think it went through his ear and maybe out one side of his head. And then, like I say, it ricocheted off something and then hit the bystander,&quot; Oates said. Oates wasn&#039;t at the scene, he said, but received a report on the shooting. The chief of police couldn&#039;t be reached for comment Friday and an employee at the police department said no one was available to talk about the encounter. The city manager said he didn&#039;t know the identity of the young man hit by the slug. Police didn&#039;t identify the victim in a brief news release describing what happened. Oates said the man, who had been standing about 125 feet away at the time of the shooting, was examined and released from Providence Seward Medical Center. The department&#039;s statement said police fired on the bear for public safety reasons. &quot;I think they had full cause to shoot the bear, because they were very, very concerned about the actions of the bear and the threat to people down there,&quot; Oates said. One police officer said he saw as many as seven bears while on patrol on a recent night in Seward, Oates said. Seward Mayor Willard Dunham hadn&#039;t heard about the shooting Friday but said this is an &quot;unbelievable&quot; year for bear traffic in the Kenai Peninsula city of 2,600 people.

Dillon thought it was likely an injured one that had been reported scavenging in the area for several days. The officer went looking for the bear on foot, armed with a shotgun, the chief said in a written account distributed to news media Friday. &quot;The animal temporarily disappeared from sight near an outbuilding as the officer approached. Officer Dillon was stopped near a car parked in the driveway when he again observed the bear from a distance of about 25 yards. When the bear saw him, it charged straight on for a distance of about 14 yards at which time it quartered slightly away. Officer Dillon took that opportunity to step away from the parked vehicle and fire a single shot, dropping the animal.&quot; The chief said the bear likely was attracted by a fresh caribou head within a few feet of where the bear was shot. Lucking says someone apparently had just butchered the caribou and the smell and head attracted the bear. The bear was first noticed in Soldotna on Sunday &quot;when it tore the lid off a chest freezer at a residence on South Fireweed.&quot; It was seen raiding garbage bins in town, and later charged two officers, police said.

Police first responded to calls about a bear lying in an alley near the Northwood Condos at 5:42 p.m. They decided to leave the animal alone, hoping it would go away, but continued to get calls. The bear wasn&#039;t acting normally and appeared to be sick, Police Capt. Tom Porter said. Officers returned at 7:43 p.m. to find the bear lying in a carport with &quot;labored and heavy breathing.&quot; When the bear stood up, it had to lean on the building for support, police said. After an hour, they directed the full-grown adult animal to a ditch near Super Kmart and shot it, Porter said. The bear&#039;s carcass was incinerated. &quot;We waited. It was between a storage shed and a side of a house and the animal did finally get up and start moving and when it did we were able to direct it into an area that was open,&quot; he said. Police usually contact the Alaska Department of Fish and Game in such situations, but were unable to reach local biologists, Porter said. &quot;I don&#039;t know of any people that were immediately threatened, but the factors were such that the animal wasn&#039;t showing fear or apprehension of people or officers in a highly populated area. Children live in that area and it appeared to be sick, which was a concern for us,&quot; he said. &quot;The fact that we couldn&#039;t contact anyone from Fish and Game left us with very few choices.&quot; Police have been getting calls about a bear rummaging through trash in the area for the past three weeks and are fairly certain it is the same animal, he said. The incident Saturday tied up three of five officers on duty for several hours, Porter said. Polly Hessing, assistant area wildlife management biologist for Fish and Game, said she and her co-worker Neil Barten were out of town this weekend. Bears do get sick, although Hessing said she couldn&#039;t make a judgment on the situation without having seen what happened. &quot;The biggest mortality for bears is humans and other bears once they make it to adulthood, but other things can happen,&quot; she said. Rebecca Van Keuren, who was eating dinner with her boyfriend across the street from the shooting Saturday, said she was surprised to hear a siren and gunshots. &quot;We called the police and they said it was a bear, they had just killed a bear,&quot; she said. &quot;It was kind of scary, though, just not knowing why there were gunshots (earlier).&quot; Van Keuren said she hadn&#039;t seen the bear earlier that evening and didn&#039;t notice any people standing by when the animal was shot. &quot;There tend to be a lot of bears in the area.

The bear, which appeared to be a cub, was first spotted by residents about noon Saturday on North Seventh and Bushkill streets, Easton police Capt. Scott Casterline said. Officers investigated the initial reports, but could not locate the bear. Another round of calls to police about bear sightings started coming in shortly after 10 p.m. These calls placed the bear in the area of North Fifth and North Sixth streets, near the Easton Area Public Library. Some of the callers were reporting that the bear was rummaging through trashcans, Casterline said. Officers went back out and this time tracked down the bear in the wooded area, Casterline said. &quot;We made several attempts to tranquilize the bear, from what I&#039;m told,&quot; the captain said, adding the department also reached out to the Pennsylvania Game Commission for assistance, but the commission was unable to respond. The officers then decided to put the bear down, Casterline said. He said he did not know how many shots were discharged, but noted that he believes officers handled the incident appropriately given the circumstances. The captain did not know the size or age of the bear. He said the remains are being kept on city property for the time being. The department plans to contact the game commission again on Monday. Often times, Casterline said, the commission will come out to inspect a dead bear. Saturday night&#039;s incident marks the second time this month that Easton police were called out to investigate bear sightings. Last week, several South Side residents reported seeing a bear roaming around near Madison Street. That bear disappeared after running into a wooded area, Casterline said. &quot;It&#039;s not that unusual,&quot; he said of black bears turning up within city limits.

The owner of the dog that was killed, Oshea Lamar Humphrey, was detained and later released on summonses for dog at large, no rabies shot and no dog license. Humphrey, 20, lives in the 2100 block of Madison Avenue. There were no injuries to officers or citizens. There will be an administrative investigation into the circumstances surrounding this incident, Thurston said. The officer will remain on regular duty during the investigation.

The officer, whose name was not released to the media, was treated for injuries that were not considered to be life-threatening. The dog&#039;s owner, 46-year-old Willie James Sims, was arrested and charged with assault of a law enforcement officer, disorderly conduct while intoxicated, drunk in public, obstruction of justice, assault and battery on a family member, and having a dangerous or vicious dog. Police spokesman Harold Eley said officers responded around noon Sunday to a home in the 4600 block of Madison Avenue after receiving a call reporting a domestic disturbance between a married couple. When the woman opened the door for the officers, an adult male pit bull charged through the door and bit an officer on the left hand and forearm. The officer drew his gun and fired two shots, striking the dog. At that point, Eley said, Sims ran out of the house and began attacking the injured officer. The officer used pepper spray to stop him. Animal Control was called to take care of the injured dog. Sims is being held without bond. Eley said the police department is investigating the incident because it involved an officer discharging his weapon.

Ernest Lynn said he was putting Hulk, a five-year-old pit bull, on a chain at Import Village, an auto repair shop and salvage yard at 1220 W. Pembroke Ave., about 9:30 a.m. when the dog charged him. ``He growled and snapped at my hands,&#039;&#039; Lynn, 56, recounted. As he tried to fight off the animal, the dog mauled him, biting him in the lower left cheek, right shoulder and left hand, Lynn said. A pit terrier that was loose distracted the pit bull, and when the other dog lunged at Hulk, Lynn ran about 100 feet into the garage. He immediately dialed 911 for help. When Lynn looked back, he said, the pit bull and terrier were still fighting. Two police officers and several firefighter/paramedics found Hulk at the entrance of the building when they arrived minutes later, said Cpl. Jeff Walden. The officers distracted the pit bull long enough for the paramedics to reach the building and escort Lynn to an ambulance. He was taken to Sentara Hampton General Hospital for treatment. About five minutes after the attack, Sgt. Larry Stovall and a Peninsula SPCA officer pulled up at Lynn&#039;s business, Walden said. As Stovall stepped from his patrol car, the pit bull charged him. ``The officer tried to jump out of the way, but the dog continued toward him,&#039;&#039; Walden said. Stovall drew his .45-caliber pistol and fired at least three shots at the dog. One of the bullets passed through the chest and the other two each hit an upper hind leg. Stovall was about 2 feet from the dog when he fired, an SPCA official said. ``Even after the bullets hit the dog, they still had to chase him around the yard. He was still kicking when they caught him,&#039;&#039; the SPCA source said. The animal control officer took the wounded animal to a veterinary hospital on North Armistead Avenue, where it was euthanized. Lynn said the other dog was in good shape. Lynn received 36 stitches, ``28 in one place and eight in the other,&#039;&#039; he said. He said Hulk belonged to his brother, who also works at Import Village. Lynn said he was surprised by the attack because Hulk never showed any signs of viciousness. ``I thought he was gentle, mild-mannered dog, but then again my brother handled him most of the time,&#039;&#039; he said. Lynn says he is not upset with the officer&#039;s action. ``The dog cannot be trusted anymore. If he attacked me, I believe he&#039;ll attack somebody else.&#039;&#039; Walden said the department&#039;s Office of Professional Standards is reviewing the shooting, which is customary anytime an officer fires his weapon.','http://articles.dailypress.com/1998-11-14/news/9811140134_1_pit-bull-dog-mauled-ernest-lynn','Hulk','Larry Stovall','1','0',0,1,0,0,0,'Uniform',1,2,2,2,0,0),(1248,'2011-12-21','Virginia','Roanoke','Roanoke Police Department',2,2,1,'Unconfirmed','Roanoke police say an officer shot and killed two pit bulls after they attacked a woman.

The officer shot the dog in the paw, and bullet fragments struck Huggett in the arm. ?The officer used his weapon in self-defense of himself and the DCF worker,? said Capt.

But, Huggett told WFTV the dog never charged. &quot;I just think it was going to just jump up on him, it&#039;s a very playful dog,&quot; he said. Huggett said he&#039;s upset the officer opened fire, because he knows him personally. &quot;Mad, very mad you know?&quot; he told WFTV.

The officer was back at work Monday. The dogs&#039; owners have their animals back in their Sheridan Road home, including one shot by police through its right foreleg, but they face a citation and potential tight restrictions if their pets are determined to be vicious dogs, police said. The Pekin Police Department will investigate the case in which one officer, reporting he acted in self-defense, fired a shot that passed through the dog&#039;s leg, ricocheted to hit a parked SUV&#039;s taillight and apparently sent a splintered fragment into a second officer&#039;s right cheek. The officer, whose name was not released, required stitches but no further medical treatment, said department Public Information Officer Don Jolly. Jody Wilson said Monday she&#039;s scared for her 7-month-old son&#039;s life and feels trapped in her and husband Alan&#039;s home at 809 Sheridan. &quot;We don&#039;t feel safe in our house anymore,&quot; she said. Shortly before 10:20 a.m. Sunday, police were summoned to the driveway of the Wilsons&#039; home. Her visiting aunt and uncle were trapped in their SUV in the driveway by three large and aggressive dogs that had escaped through an open side door of an attached garage of the home next to the Wilsons&#039; home and were circling the SUV with snarls and bared teeth, Jolly said. &quot;When my uncle opened the (vehicle) door they just came at him,&quot; said Jody Wilson. &quot;I told them to stay inside, and I called the police.&quot;\r\nThe first officer to arrive saw the three dogs - a large, mixed black lab-pit bull, a medium brown pit bull and a large German shepherd - retreat back to the garage, Jolly said. When a second officer arrived, one of the dogs emerged from the garage and growled, but retreated again. The second officer walked to the SUV as the first stood guard. Two of the dogs charged from the garage &quot;and came directly at the first officer,&quot; Jolly said, &quot;barking, baring teeth and running viciously,&quot; according to the officer&#039;s report.\r\nThe officer pulled his service weapon and fired one shot. It penetrated the leg of the lab-pit bull mix, which then yelped and ran off, dragging its wounded leg. The second dog followed, Jolly said. Blood began streaming down the second officer&#039;s face. While the SUV&#039;s taillight was shattered, it wasn&#039;t plastic that cut the second officer, Jolly said. &quot;A piece of the bullet was extracted from his face.&quot; The dogs&#039; owners were out of town at the time, Jolly said. While the pets were being watched by someone else, the owners were issued a citation for allowing dogs to roam &quot;at large,&quot; Jolly said. Deborah Brooks, 46, and her son, Danny Joe Pherigo, 25, also may be required to keep their dogs tethered and muzzled whenever they&#039;re outside of their home at 811 Sheridan.

Fred was known to roam the streets of the neighborhood, and Havard said her neighbors treated him like a member of their own families, too.\r\n\r\n&quot;He was a really good dog. He liked playing fetch a lot,&quot; Havard said. &quot;Everybody loved him and, like, everybody knew him and he knew that he was going to protect everybody.&quot;\r\n\r\nLast Thursday, the unthinkable happened.\r\n\r\nNeighbor Virginia Lewis was inside her home when she heard what sounded like a shotgun blast.\r\n\r\nShe went outside to investigate and was horrified when she saw Fred lying in the street.\r\n\r\n&quot;I was just down here petting him and rubbing him, crying like a baby,&quot; Lewis said.\r\n\r\nLewis would soon learn that Fred had been shot by a man whom her neighbors identified as an off-duty Harris County Sheriff&#039;s Office deputy who&#039;d been riding his bicycle through the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nAccording to Lewis, the off-duty law officer claimed he got scared because Fred started nipping at his heels while he was riding his bike.\r\n\r\n&quot;Fred would protect you, but he wouldn&#039;t hurt you,&quot; Lewis said.\r\n\r\nLiberty County Sheriff&#039;s Office investigators say the deputy told them the dog tried to attack him, so he shot it in self-defense.

Sixth Street, was seeking more than $25,000 for the loss of Zeus, her 17-year-old pit bull, according to court documents filed in March 2012 in Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas Civil Division. The suit stated that on Oct. 9, 2011, around 5 p.m., Zeus slipped out of Leonard&#039;s residence and was loose in the neighborhood. A resident along the 600 block of N. State Street saw the dog walking on the street. According to the suit, the dog was calm and presented no danger.\r\nTwo Clairton officers, one of whom was Sgt. James Carozza, arrived in a police van approximately 50 feet from where the resident was, and she watched officers shoot the dog, the suit stated. Carozza allegedly shot the dog twice while in the police vehicle, and another officer who was outside the vehicle shot it again. Another resident reported he heard three gunshots come from outside his house. The suit stated that resident noticed the dog was shot, and knew it to be friendly and mild-mannered. The suit claimed Carozza shot and killed Zeus without due cause, provocation or justification. It also claimed Carozza failed to seize, detain or restrain the dog with nonviolent measures. It alleged Carozza discharged a firearm in a residential neighborhood without any warning. Leonard was found guilty of letting the dog run loose in connection with the incident at a summary trial on Feb. 13, 2012, according to court documents from Glassport Magisterial District Judge Armand A. Martin&#039;s office. At the same trial, Leonard was found not guilty of failure to keep dog licenses and failure to have the dog vaccinated. The judge ordered Leonard to pay $369.50 and a $25 payment was made on April 13, 2012. A warrant was issued for her arrest on June 8, 2012, for failure to pay the remaining $344.50. Judge&#039;s office officials said on Wednesday that amount has yet to be paid, and the warrant remains active.\r\nBednar said he could not disclose the amount of the settlement because Leonard has yet to sign the document. &ldquo;You need two to tango,&rdquo; Bednar said. &ldquo;We&#039;re saying we&#039;ll dance.&rdquo; Councilors approved the agreement at Tuesday night&#039;s meeting in a 3-0 vote.

Wendy-Jo Mansfield and her two sons, William Donald Holst and Cody Ryan Holst, all of Costa Mesa, sued the city after their pit bull was shot by police in 2004. The financial settlement was finalized Friday, according to a statement from Mansfield&#039;s attorney, Jerry Steering. In Steering&#039;s account of the May 2004 incident, Costa Mesa police shot the dog in Mansfield&#039;s backyard after it approached an officer. Officers were in the yard looking for two of William Holst&#039;s friends after they fled from officers attempting to give them tickets, according to Steering. ALTERNATE COVERAGE ( http://www.ocregister.com/articles/mansfield-41456-dog-officers.html ): Wendy-Jo Mansfield drove home from work nearly three years ago and discovered her two sons in handcuffs, her Shar-Pei-pit bull shot to death and police surrounding her home. &quot;It reminded me of a war zone,&quot; Mansfield said Thursday. After the shooting, Mansfield sued Costa Mesa, alleging that police were wrong to shoot her dog. On Wednesday, the city agreed to pay the family $225,000 to settle the case. The home tucked in a quiet cul-de-sac in a Costa Mesa neighborhood became a nightmare she&#039;s hoping to move away from with the settlement money. Officers shot Paul on May 13, 2004, after they chased two boys through Mansfield&#039;s back yard. The boys were friends with the family, and police said they had run away from officers who tried to cite them for riding bicycles without helmets. &quot;The officers did absolutely nothing wrong,&quot; said Harold Potter, the assistant city attorney. &quot;Based on the circumstances of the case, we thought it was prudent to settle.&quot; Potter declined to share the circumstances; however, he said that &quot;the case was more complex than a dead dog.&quot; Mansfield said her sons, Billy, then 18, and Cody, then 16, are still traumatized after watching an officer shoot their dog more than a dozen times. &quot;They altered our lives,&quot; Mansfield said. &quot;They took my children&#039;s childhoods.&quot; Mansfield&#039;s attorney, Jerry Steering, said Billy and Cody had begged the officers to allow them to put the dog away because they feared the police would get scared by Paul and shoot him. The police officers refused, according to Steering, and two officers jumped into the back yard after pointing a gun at Billy, telling him to freeze. Whether the dog attacked the officer or simply tried to smell him is unknown. What&#039;s clear is that soon after, one officer shot the dog as Billy watched. &quot;They came into our yards like terrorists,&quot; Mansfield said. &quot;I&#039;m sure my dog felt that my sons were under attack.&quot; She said suing the city was her only recourse. &quot;They make you play in that money arena,&quot; Mansfield said. &quot;They never apologized or showed any remorse.&quot; She said Paul, who was 3, was more than an animal who suffered from rickets after someone rescued him from a trash bin, he was a family member. Mansfield said her other dog, Kali, is still shaken from what happened. &quot;She&#039;s a little nervous if you come to the door in a dark-blue uniform,&quot; Mansfield said.

When two Richmond police officers with their guns drawn startled Champ from his favorite nap spot alongside his home on Reid Court seven years ago, they shot him dead -- a killing that a San Francisco federal jury agreed violated the dog owner&#039;s rights to the tune of $255,000. &quot;He was harmless,&quot; said Champs&#039; owner James Fuller of Richmond. &quot;He was a big gentle thing. He&#039;d never bitten anybody.&quot; San Francisco civil rights lawyer Kirk Boyd argued that the killing of Champ was unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment&#039;s protection against illegal searches and seizures of personal property. &quot;The dog was a personal effect,&quot; Boyd said. Richmond police had entered Fuller&#039;s side yard, where Champ was sleeping, with their guns drawn while searching for a suspect they believed to be hiding nearby. Police said Champ posed a threat and lunged through the air at them -- even after being shot in the chest the first time with a .357 Magnum. But Fuller and his son, who witnessed the shooting, say the dog never lunged at the officers but rather was fixed in a stare-down with them when he was shot the first time. &quot;I told them, &#039;Don&#039;t shoot my dog -- I can control my dog,&#039; &quot; Fuller said. &quot;One policeman ordered the other to shoot, and he shot my dog, and then he shot him again, and I couldn&#039;t believe it. They had no right to do that.&quot; Fuller said he would not have pursued legal action had the two officers involved in the shooting apologized to him and his family. Police Captain Bob Becker said the department is sorry the family lost its pet but also disappointed in the jury&#039;s verdict. &quot;I&#039;ve never heard of a verdict where there were punitive damages awarded in a case involving the dispatching of an animal that&#039;s charging an officer,&quot; Becker said. During the two-week trial that ended December 18, testimony on behalf of Champ came from Fuller and some of his family, neighbors and friends and the dog&#039;s veterinarian, who told the jury that the 11- year-old dog had severe arthritis and probably could not have lunged through the air as officers said. Mayor Rosemary Corbin said that as a dog owner she sympathizes with the Fuller family but cautioned that police must be allowed to do their jobs too. &quot;In a police situation like that, where a decision has to be made in a split-second, it&#039;s hard to second- guess afterwards,&quot; Corbin said. Boyd, Fuller&#039;s lawyer, said that to his knowledge, this was the first case that used the Fourth Amendment to compensate someone whose dog was shot by police. He said he believes that the city spent several hundred thousand dollars over the years to fight the case. &quot;To me, that&#039;s the shocking part of this case,&quot; Boyd said. &quot;I don&#039;t believe the people in Richmond wanted their lawyers to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars trying to undermine constitutional rights.&quot; \r\nLawsuit Information: \r\nJames FULLER, Sr.; James Fuller, Jr., et al., v.

The Fullers were in the yard, along with their pet dog, &quot;Champ.&quot; The Fullers allege that, as the officers approached, Champ merely stood up from where he had been lying. The officers, on the other hand, contend that Champ charged them, barking and growling. James Fuller, Sr. contends that he pleaded with the officers not to shoot his dog and told them that he could control him. Nonetheless, the officers shot Champ twice, and Champ died shortly thereafter. After the shooting, James Jr. was upset and was &quot;wrestled to the ground by his friend out of fear of further confrontation&quot; with the officers. The Fullers allege that one of the officers then pointed his gun at James Jr.&#039;s head, drew back the hammer, and threatened to kill him, despite the fact that James Jr. was a &quot;considerable distance&quot; from the officers. The officers contend that James Jr. charged at them, and that a weapon was pointed at him in order to subdue him. The confrontation ended without further incident. The Fullers filed suit in federal district court alleging that the shooting of Champ and the threat of force against James Jr. constituted violations of their civil rights pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983. The complaint alleged that the officers violated the Fullers&#039; procedural and substantive due process rights. The complaint included claims against the City of Richmond for failure to properly train and supervise its officers. The complaint also asserted state law claims for negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress, assault, and destruction of property. Based on the original complaint, the defendants moved for summary judgment. The Fullers filed an opposition to the summary judgment motion, including a motion for leave to amend their complaint. The proposed amendment would have added allegations that the officers unlawfully &quot;seized&quot; the Fullers&#039; property when they killed Champ and unlawfully &quot;seized&quot; James Jr. when an officer pointed a gun at him, both in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The district court heard argument on the motions on October 16, 1992. On November 3, 1992, the court entered a memorandum opinion and order. In the order, the court granted the defendants&#039; motion for summary judgment, finding as a matter of law that the Fullers could not establish that the officers&#039; actions deprived them of any due process rights guaranteed by the Constitution. The court then dismissed the pendent state law claims. The district court also denied the motion to amend, finding that the proposed amendment would not cure the deficiencies in the complaint. The Fullers then moved for reconsideration under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) claiming that the court should address their Fourth Amendment seizure claims. The court denied the motion under Rule 60 stating that the Fullers failed to plead a cause of action under the Fourth Amendment in their original complaint.\r\nALTERNATE ACCOUNT INCLUDING OFFICERS&#039; NAMES: http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&amp;dat=19981231&amp;id=JldWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=oOsDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4856,8256662','http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Federal-Jury-Awards-Richmond-Owner-of-Slain-Dog-2970304.php','Champ,','Keith Vines, Unknown Second Cop','2','0',2,0,0,2,2,'Uniform',0,2,2,2,1,0),(1257,'2012-11-16','New Jersey','Trenton','Trenton Police Department Tactical Anti-Crime Unit 2',1,2,1,'Unconfirmed','A gun-toting man who threatened police officers for killing his pit bull was caught Monday after officers responded to a burglary call, police said.

Astbury had shot the dog after it was thrown at him by at-large suspect Tony Butler in an incident Friday night at West Hanover Street. On Monday night, police responded to a burglary in progress call on the 400 block of West Hanover and found Glover by chance. &ldquo;We went to stop him and he took off running,&rdquo; Sgt. Brian Cipoloni said. Officer Edward Leopardi, who was working with his K-9 partner Stryder, pursued Glover on foot down West Hanover. Glover was able to cross the canal over a bridge, and was crouching by a tin shed when Leopardi spotted him with the aid of a flashlight. Glover, who was armed, threw away his gun, which bounced off a tree in mid-flight and fell in the shallow end of the water, Cipoloni said. The foot chase continued, and Glover was finally captured on the first block of Camden Street. The Trenton Fire Department put its dive team in the canal Tuesday morning and was able to recover the .38 caliber snub-nose revolver Glover had thrown in, Cipoloni said.

Rudy Gonzales, 35, was suspected of stealing a car on Saturday. Round Rock police knew Gonzales was staying at the Homewood Suites at 2201 S. Mays and requested that the hotel staff call them when he returned. Staff called police at 10:43 a.m. Sunday to let them know Gonzales arrived back at the hotel, and officers responded. According RRPD spokeswoman Angelique Myers, Gonzales tried to lunge the stolen Ford Mustang he was driving at a police cruiser before he drove off. Myers said Gonzales led officers on a pursuit northbound on the Interstate 35 service road before he went under the McNeil Bridge and continued south on the frontage road. Gonzales continued driving until he crashed into electrical lines in front of the Mister Car Wash near the intersection of S. I-35 and SH-45. At that time, police say Gonzales exited the Mustang with his pitbull mix on a leash and attempted to steal a black Lexus SUV parked near the car wash exit. A family, including children, were inside the car, Myers said. Gonzales &ldquo;wrestled&rdquo; with the driver before he was tased by an officer, Myers said. Upon being tased, Gonzalez dropped the leash and the dog bit an officer on the hand. &ldquo;After he bit the officer on the arm, he continued to lunge at the officer&rsquo;s throat. The other officer fired shots that ultimately killed the dog,&rdquo; said Myers. Round Rock police took Gonzales into custody and charged him with unauthorized use of a motor vehicle, evading arrest, and attempted kidnapping.

On December 18th, Mountain City Police Officers responded to an auto burglary in the parking lot of a local restaurant. The search for the suspect led police to a home nearby. While at the home, an officer encountered a dog that was later shot by police. &quot;He was like one of our kids, he was a part of our family.&quot; The owner of the dog, Shatona Lunceford told News Channel 11, while away in Johnson City, she received several phone calls from neighbors about an incident involving police at her home. When she called police to find out what was going on Lunceford said they told her, &quot;my dog had been shot because my door was unlocked.&quot; Lunceford said police told her officers were searching for an auto burglary suspect. &quot;They thought the man that was running from them was inside my house...I don&#039;t care if they thought he was in there or not they should&#039;ve never opened up my door,&quot; said Lunceford. Once the dog got out, Lunceford said he ran towards her fence and as he turned to come back towards the home an officer shot her dog. Police Chief Denver Church confirmed that an officer shot the dog because he thought the dog was being aggressive. But Lunceford and her boyfriend said he had no history of violence. &quot;They won&#039;t release us any information. They won&#039;t release us our dog.

Investigators are working to track down who released the pit bulls. A jogger told police he saw someone let them out of a blue Toyota pickup truck at 6:35 a.m. When the unleashed dogs ran from the car, they attacked the jogger&rsquo;s own 7-year-old pit bull. The jogger took his dog to a veterinarian but it had suffered such severe wounds in the attack that it needed to be euthanized, police said. Another pit bull attack was reported at 11 a.m. The dogs attacked a 60-year-old San Leandro man&rsquo;s 3-year-old bull terrier and 10-year-old Chihuahua as he was walking them, police said. When the man tried to step in, the pit bulls attacked him. Guests of the nearby Marina Inn came to his aid and tried to fight the pit bulls back with chairs. The dogs continued attacking but ran away after the man was knocked into the water, police said. The man was taken to Kaiser Medical Center in San Leandro to be treated for dog bites. The Chihuahua required surgery, police said.  Officers started searching for the vicious dogs and found them in the Marina Faire neighborhood. When they ran after them, the dogs ran in different directions. One officer tried to stop the dogs with a Taser stun gun but it didn&rsquo;t work, police said. Two officers later found one of the dogs on Blue Whale Drive and tried to corner it. The officers thought the aggressive dog might attack and shot it, police said.  The other dog was found near Our Lady of Good Counsel Parish at 2500 Bermuda Ave. Everyone inside the church was told to shelter in place as police tried to stop the dog. The dog was in the back lot of the church when police arrived and acted aggressively. Officers shot the dog several times but it kept coming at them. They shot it again and it died, police said.

According to a Police Department press release, a police dog and its handler were threatened by the dog when they entered the residence to arrest Reilly.&quot;The officers were forced to shoot and kill the suspect&#039;s dog to prevent the dog from attacking an officer and his K-9 who were in the area,&quot; the press release said.The press release did not say how many officers were involved and did not name the officer who shot the dog, and Oxnard officials would not elaborate Tuesday. Michael Fields, 21, who was visiting Reilly at the time, was also arrested on suspicion of disturbing the peace and resisting arrest, the statement said.Assistant Chief William Cady said it is not unprecedented for police to shoot a dog that threatens to attack a police dog. He said it has happened at least twice in the 10-year history of the department&#039;s K-9 unit, although he could not recall the exact dates.&quot;It&#039;s not like it happens every week,&quot; he said, adding that such action is taken to protect the police dog.However, Orozco, Reilly and his son, Michael Reilly, told a different story.Reilly, a civilian employee at the Port Hueneme naval center, said he was asleep when two officers came to his door on Sunday night and told him they had received a noise complaint from a neighbor.Reilly said he told the officers that he had been asleep for two hours and was not making any noise. When the officers insisted that he step out of the house, Reilly said he &quot;shut the door and went back to bed.&quot;A few minutes later, several officers returned and insisted again that Reilly step out of the house, he said. When Reilly refused again, several officers entered the house and arrested him, he said.\r\nAs he was being escorted to a police car, Reilly said his son&#039;s dog began to follow him. When he told the officers not to hurt the dog, Reilly said one officer commented: &quot;Oh, you like this dog?&quot; and shot it six times.&quot;The cop was totally out of line,&quot; he said.Reilly, who said he is considering filing a lawsuit against the Oxnard police, said he does not know the name of the officer who shot the dog. The police dog and its handler were on the other side of the street when the shooting took place, he said.Michael Reilly said he was about to keep the dog from following his father when the officer shot the dog. He said the dog did not growl or bark at the officers.When the officer shot the dog, Orozco said that her boyfriend and another friend began to shout at the officers from her house across the street. She said the officer kept shooting at the dog even after it was dead. &quot;They just unloaded on the dog,&quot; she said.Reilly, who was released on Monday pending a court appearance, said he and his son raised the dog from a puppy.&quot;It was like a baby to us,&quot; he said. &quot;My son has been crying about this for two days.&quot; ','http://articles.latimes.com/1990-08-29/local/me-50_1_police-dog','Duke','Unknown','1','0',1,0,0,1,1,'Uniform',0,2,2,2,2,2),(1267,'2014-12-17','Missouri','Camden','Ray County Sheriff Department, Camden Police Department',1,50,0,'Golden Retriever and Chow Mix, 3yo','A family&#039;s dog was shot three times by a small town police officer. That much is fact. But the events that sparked the death of the golden retriever has sparked much controversy in Camden, which has a population of just 191. The Wilhite family is asking for justice after they say the police officer shot the dog in their own yard. &quot;I just felt like I just watched one of my family members be murdered,&rdquo; said Rhiannon Wilhite. The police officer says he was protecting himself and others say the family refused to control the aggressive dog. The Wilhite family dog, Marley, was a 4-year-old golden retriever and chow mix. &quot;He was a good dog,&quot; said Raymond Wilhite. He and his former wife say the dog has not had any history of aggression, but others disagree. On Friday, a woman, who asked to remain anonymous due to the strong emotions involved, called 911 to report that the dog had attacked her 16-year-old daughter. &ldquo;My daughter came home from school crying because she was attacked by the dog,&rdquo; the woman explained. She waited outside for police to arrive. Camden Police Chief Anthony Holiman headed to the Wilhite&#039;s house to investigate the issue. Unaware that the police had been called, Raymond Wilhite got his children inside their home. About 3 p.m., he let Marley out to the front yard unattended. Holiman, who also works as a Ray County Sheriff&#039;s Office deputy, arrived in his sheriff&#039;s office vehicle but was acting as a Camden police officer in the matter. The dog started barking, which alerted Wilhite to Holiman&#039;s arrival. &ldquo;He (Holiman) said that he (Marley) chased a little girl up the street and he (Marley) needs to be tied up when she gets off the bus,&rdquo; said Rhiannon Wilhite. Rhiannon Wilhite said she acknowledged the officer and tried to catch her dog, but was unable to do so. Holiman said the dog was acting aggressively. &quot;The dog&#039;s hair was standing up on his back. He was growling and came at me,&quot; the officer explained. Rhiannon Wilhite was stunned when the officer fired his service weapon. &ldquo;When I turned to look at the door I heard a shot, and then another shot and I was in disbelief, pure shock - I didn&#039;t know what to do,&rdquo; she said. The family says the dog wasn&#039;t close to the officer, and was at least 20 feet away. &ldquo;I watched him, I was standing there, she (Rhiannon) was beside him (Chief Holiman) and he took that well-aimed third shot and that was it,&rdquo; Raymond Wilhite said. Their two children also watched the events unfold, and the girls remain quite upset about what happened. &ldquo;Friday night they told me they didn&#039;t want Christmas, they just wanted their dog back for Christmas,&rdquo; their mother said. The family had a stake to tie the dog up to outside and had a dog house and straw outside for Marley. Some Camden residents said Marley had a history of aggression and his owners were irresponsible too many times.An gelique Ritchie said her son was playing with the Wilhite children when Marley bit him twice in June. &ldquo;Thank God it wasn&#039;t anything he had to be hospitalized for but after that it&#039;s anger, you know?&rdquo; Angelique Ritchie said. &ldquo;Why don&#039;t you just keep your dog in your own yard?&rdquo; Ritchie&#039;s son Toby has scars on his chest and arm from the alleged June attack. The family says police warned the Wilhites about Marley&#039;s aggression and the city&#039;s leash law. &ldquo;If there were complaints, we never knew about them,&rdquo; Raymond Wilhite said. &ldquo;I&#039;m not saying he didn&#039;t (bite anyone) but I&#039;m saying, I have never seen him bite anyone.&rdquo; The woman whose 911 telephone call sparked the events said Marley came after the officer and was just two or three feet from Holiman when he shot him. She said the officer fired the final shot to put the dog out of his misery. &quot;Yes, we feel bad that this is the way it ended but she (the woman&#039;s daughter) shouldn&#039;t have to worry about coming home from the bus stop and getting bit,&quot; the woman said. The family maintains that Marley was a big dog who barked, but was not vicious. The Wilhites saw the situation differently. Raymond Wilhite says the he saw the officer shooting the dog from across the front yard. Camden&#039;s mayor said an outside agency will likely be asked to investigate the circumstances of Marley&#039;s death since Holiman is the town&#039;s only police officer.','http://www.kctv5.com/story/27703814/officer-fatally-shooting-familys-dog-sparks-uproar-in-small-mo-town','Marley','Anthony Holiman who is both Camden City Police Chief and Ray County Sheriffs Office deputy','0','0',1,0,0,0,2,'Uniform',0,2,2,2,2,2),(1268,'2014-09-11','Oklahoma','Tulsa','Tulsa Police Department',1,30,1,'Pit Bull, 3yo','A Tulsa police officer shot a dog early Thursday.

Ruby is a 3-year-old pit bull. She&#039;s leaving one vet clinic for specialized care at another, after she was shot Thursday morning by a Tulsa police officer. &quot;I&#039;m sure she could look threatening; she could look scary; it&#039;s her territory - it&#039;s her property,&quot; said owner Lana Ellsbury. That&#039;s about as much credit as the dog&#039;s owner is willing to give the officer who shot her. The officer was checking an alarm call at a house when the dog came around the corner of another house, according to the officer, barking and ready to bite. &quot;He&#039;s at the point now that there&#039;s no return, either take a dog bite or be mauled or protect himself and that officer chose to protect himself,&quot; said Officer Leland Ashley, Tulsa Police. The police say it&#039;s clear cut, but Janet Ellsbury, who heard it all happen, thinks the officer should have retreated to his car or somehow fought off the dog. &quot;And I just think something else could have been done other than shooting that dog three times,&quot; said Janet Ellsbury. Ruby has several wounds, but it&#039;s not clear how many times she was hit. She took off running from the scene, near the airport, and was found along a road in Catoosa. &quot;She was mangled, her jaw, she got shot in her jaw, shoulder and thigh,&quot; Janet said.

An officer was running radar in a parking lot next to Mann&#039;s Welding Co. on Workman Road when the attack began.

Although Homewood police continue to look into the shooting, Atkinson said it appears the officer acted within departmental policy. An ongoing feud between the residents of the two homes flared up again Sunday, Atkinson said. The father and son were arrested on misdemeanor menacing charges because both were armed while they confronted one of the four neighbors, who in turn was arrested on harassment charges because he threatened to get a gun and shoot the father and son, Atkinson said. Weapons were confiscated from all three and will not be immediately returned to the owners, Atkinson said. &quot;This is a powder keg,&quot; Atkinson said of the feud in the neighborhood. &quot;It&#039;s obviously not over, but maybe going to jail will help cool it off,&quot; Atkinson said....','https://web.archive.org/web/20111229224246/http://www.al.com/news/birminghamnews/index.ssf?/base/news/121662811059750.xml&amp;coll=2','Unknown','Unknown','2','0',2,0,0,1,1,'Uniform',2,2,2,2,2,2),(1274,'2008-07-23','Alabama','Mobile','Mobile Police Department',1,2,1,'Unconfirmed','A pit bull Mobile police shot Tuesday was &quot;humanely euthanized&quot; Wednesday night after the dog&#039;s owners failed to get veterinary care for the animal, which had the .40-caliber bullet lodged in its muzzle, according to the director of the Mobile Animal Shelter. The director, Ellen Lursen, said late Wednesday that shelter personnel issued a cruelty to animal citation to the owner after they found the dog suffering. &quot;The owners decided to release the animal to the animal shelter to be humanely euthanized,&quot; Lursen said. &quot;We cannot abide someone treating an animal like that,&quot; she said. Police said they shot the dog when it approached an officer in an &quot;aggressive manner.&quot; Michael Jackson said earlier Wednesday that he did not want to have &quot;Breaker&quot; euthanized and didn&#039;t have the money to have the bullet removed. He said he would try to raise the necessary cash. Blood dripped from the dog&#039;s nose Wednesday afternoon, and it could be heard breathing through the hole on the right side of its face. Jackson said the bullet appears to have lodged in the roof of Breaker&#039;s mouth. At that point, Breaker was unable to eat hard dog food, Jackson said, so he was feeding the dog chicken and mushroom soups and giving it water. The shooting occurred about 4:30 p.m. at Jackson&#039;s home on Gaylark Road off Azalea Road in west Mobile. According to Jackson, he and his wife, Teresa Fisher, own Breaker and three other pit bulls. Three of the dogs are adults and one is a puppy, the 36-year-old man said. The dogs are kept in the house, Jackson said, but somehow two got loose while he and his wife were visiting relatives. He said when they arrived back at their house, about a dozen police officers were standing in front, some with the pistols drawn. One dog was in the yard, and Breaker, already shot, was hiding beside the house, Jackson said. An officer &quot;asked me if I could secure the dog, and I said &#039;yes,&#039;&quot; Jackson said. &quot;I grabbed the dog and put it in the house. The door was wide open, and I put it in the house and shut the door and everybody calmed down.&quot; Jackson said he believes the officer who shot Breaker used excessive force. He believes Breaker could have been pepper-sprayed or shot with a Taser stun gun. Jackson said his 2-year-old son Christopher plays with the dogs, sometimes roughly, and has never been bitten. Police spokesman Officer Eric Gallichant said the officer &quot;used the amount of force he thought necessary at the time&quot; to protect himself. &quot;As the officer exited his vehicle, a pit bull charged the officer in an aggressive manner,&quot; he said. Pit bulls have gained a reputation as an aggressive breed, in the news for attacking children, adults and for dog fighting. The dogs are banned in some places, including Denver and Miami-Dade County, Fla. Gallichant said someone called police when they saw the dogs roaming free. Several officers responded to back up the officer after he shot the dog. Lursen said that an animal control officer went to the scene and Jackson was given the option of keeping the dog or letting the shelter put him down. She said the dog was left at the Jackson home with the understanding that the owner would seek medical care for the dog. &quot;We wanted to give them the opportunity to have the dog treated,&quot; Lursen said. She said that shelter personnel went to check on the dog&#039;s condition Wednesday night and learned that the animal had not been treated by a veterinarian. The dog was euthanized as soon they got it to the shelter, she said. &quot;We can&#039;t allow an animal to suffer like that. On Tuesday, Jackson&#039;s wife was issued four municipal offense tickets ? one for keeping &quot;wild, dangerous or poisonous animals,&quot; and three for not having the dogs confined. Each fine is $172, Lursen said. Lursen said that the owners can decide to pay the fines for those citations without going to court if they choose to do that. &quot;But on the cruelty to animal charge, they will have to go before a judge,&quot; she said.','http://blog.al.com/live/2008/07/animal_survives_bullet_in_muzz.html','Breaker','Twelve unknown police','0','0',0,0,0,1,1,'Uniform',0,2,0,0,2,0),(1275,'2008-09-25','Indiana','Evansville','Evansville Police Department, City of Evansville Animal Control Shelter',1,2,1,'Unconfirmed','The following article is reproduced from the Evanscille Courier &amp; Press: Evansville police shot and killed a pit bull late Thursday night after the dog attacked its owner.

When they arrived in the area, they learned a second person had also been bitten. As they began to get out of their car, a group of three dogs advanced on them. Both officers then shot the most aggressive of the three, later identified as a Cane Corso, and killed it. The other two dogs then ran, but were later captured.

Police said the more seriously injured of the two is a a 73-year-old male and the second injured person is also an adult male.

The death was the first fatal attack by a pit bull on an adult that Dr. Dan Parmer, head of the Cook County Animal and Rabies Control Department, could remember. &quot;We know there are a whole lot of stray dogs all over the city, all over the county and in the forest preserve,&quot; he said. Police will distribute handbills on Tuesday warning nearby residents that feral dogs are still living in the woods and should be considered dangerous. Dan Ryan Woods will be closed Tuesday while animal control officers set traps to capture the dogs. Cieslewicz, 48, of the 9600 block of South Troy Avenue, Evergreen Park, was a nurse at a pediatric medical practice in Oak Lawn and was involved in a sports booster club at Evergreen Park High School. She had three children, ranging in age from 17 to 25. She jogged 5 or 6 miles every day and ran a marathon a few years ago, said her eldest daughter, Sandi Barber. &quot;She loved her two dogs and she loved to jog, and she loved being a mom,&quot; Barber said. &quot;This is the dog owner&#039;s fault.&quot; By the time Cieslewicz reached the section of the path just north of 83rd Street, she would have jogged 2 1/2 miles from her home. Just south of 83rd Street, the other jogger, a 46-year-old woman, was running alone at about the same time. Passersby found the woman seriously injured far off the path and called an ambulance. The woman was at Little Company of Mary Hospital, Evergreen Park, Monday night, but asked that no information about her condition be released. Soon after the 46-year-old woman was found, Forest Preserve officers discovered Cieslewicz, who lay critically injured close to the path on the other side of a bridge over 83rd Street. She died Sunday evening in Christ Medical Center. As Forest Preserve officers tended Cieslewicz, the larger of the two dogs charged them from a wooded ridge, authorities said. As it approached, one officer turned and fatally shot the animal. About three hours later, Chicago police fatally shot a second dog believed to be involved in the attack when it threatened them on the street at 73rd and Carpenter Streets, police said. The officers were responding to calls from residents of a pit bull with blood on its face roaming about, authorities said. The dead dogs were taken to county animal control offices, where they were examined. Their heads will be sent to state labs where they will be tested for rabies, Parmer said. While the Cieslewicz family gathered Monday to plan Anna Cieslewicz&#039;s funeral, officers from the Cook County Sheriff&#039;s Office and the Cook County Forest Preserve police sought clues in the forest preserve. Near the site of the two attacks, animal control officers found a plastic, igloo-shaped doghouse and fresh dog food, leading them to speculate that someone might have been caring for the dogs in the woods, perhaps training them for fighting. Later Monday, however, a neighbor said he had set up the shelter and food to help strays. The dogs that authorities believe were responsible for the attacks were mixed-breed pit bulls, one weighing about 75 pounds and the other, 50 pounds, Parmer said. The larger dog was a mottled brown and black color, while the smaller was white with brown spots on its face. &quot;They are very powerful dogs with tremendous poundage pressure in their jaws,&quot; he said. Sheriff&#039;s police were searching for the pit bulls&#039; owner, and detectives were following several leads, a spokeswoman said Monday night. The dogs were not wild, Parmer said. Both were in excellent condition. In recent weeks, joggers and bikers have reported aggressive behavior by dogs in the Dan Ryan Woods, though no incidents were as violent as Sunday&#039;s attack. Parmer said control efforts are hampered by the fact that he has only four animal control officers to patrol the forest preserves and unincorporated areas of the county. Tom Justik, 59, a marketing executive who bikes often in Dan Ryan, said in late December and again on Jan. 4, a large brown pit bull approached him menacingly. &quot;I was on a bike path Dec. 27 when a pit bull began aggressively barking at me,&quot; he said. &quot;I yelled at it and was able to get by.&quot; A week later, he was riding on the same trail when a pack of dogs, including the same brown pit bull, came toward him from the woods, barking. He pedaled hard and outpaced the dog. &quot;It ran out of breath, and when I got to the end of the bike path I climbed onto the railroad track,&quot; he said. He called Cook County Rabies and Animal Control, but received a recorded message, so he tried Chicago Animal Care and Control, he said. Officials from Chicago Animal Care and Control were not immediately available Monday. During the search,two officers, Jesse Young and Guy Johansen, found four puppies--none of them pit bulls--huddled in the hollowed trunk of a dead tree. They appeared healthy and well fed from the milk of their mother, who in turn has been living on pheasants and other birds, judging by the profusion of bird feathers on the ground near the dogs&#039; den, the officers said. Such finds caused Parmer to encourage joggers and others using the preserve to carry Mace, a whistle and a cellphone for protection. If a dog approaches, don&#039;t run, be still and wait for it to lose interest, he said. If it attacks, a victim should roll into a tight ball and try to protect the head, face and neck, he said.','http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2003-01-14/news/0301140163_1_pit-bull-dogs-forest-preserve','Unknown','Unknown','1','0',0,1,0,2,2,'Uniform',3,3,0,0,0,0),(1278,'2013-10-17','North Carolina','Mooresville','Mooresville Police Department',1,50,1,'Pit Bull','Social media outlets are abuzz after a pit bull was shot this past Thursday by a Mooresville police officer. Mooresville police said Saturday an officer shot and wounded a dog when the dog &quot;aggressively approached him.&quot; In a news release Saturday afternoon, the Mooresville Police Department said: &quot;While responding to a call for assistance from another officer, (an officer) fired non-fatal shots at a dog when the dog aggressively approached him. &quot;The dog is being treated. MPD is investigating the circumstances of the incident.&quot; Monday afternoon, Police Chief Carl Robbins said the incident is still under investigation. &ldquo;Initially it began at the front entrance of the neighborhood on Wilson Avenue around the Country Club Apartments,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;An officer observed the dogs in the road and tried to get them safely out of the road. The dogs took off and they followed them back into their neighborhood.&quot; On its Facebook page, the MPD posted on Sunday: &ldquo;There will be no comments regarding information posted on social media sites until the investigation has been completed and reviewed. (While differing comments and views are allowed to be posted on this page, any posts that are profane, abusive or threatening to the family of the animal or the MPD will be deleted.)&rdquo;\r\nThe owner of the dog, Melissa Loper, could not be reached by the Tribune Monday. However, she posted about the incident on her Facebook page along with two photos, one of her dog Pinch with a bloody paw and one of the rear window of her Suburban which she said had been shattered during the shooting incident. As for whether Loper will be compensated for the damage to her vehicle, Robbins said, &quot;Providing the investigation and seeing the circumstances with that, it&#039;s something that will be in consideration.&quot; No other details have been released. Here&rsquo;s part of what Loper had to say about the incident on Facebook the day after the shooting occurred: &ldquo;Yesterday was a terrible day for me. An officer from the Mooresville Police Department came to my house bent down on his knee and called my chihuahua to come to him out of my yard. Well she started walking to him...and so did my pit bull. The officers backup started to pull out her taser but before she could the other officer that was on his knee managed to stand up and fire his 9mm gun at my pit bull. Hitting her 3 times AND busting the back window out of my Suburban. One of the bullets went into Pinchs paw and shattered the bones. The others were deep muscle wounds in her other legs. Thank GOD we found a vet to help us with her. She had surgery last night and is going to be okay. But here&#039;s my question...What would you do if an officer fired his gun at your house just to hit a dog who was not threatening him. He shot at her just because she was a pit bull. And he was scared. My chihuahua would&#039;ve bit him before pinch would&#039;ve. Even the vets said she was a wonderful dog and very gentle even with half her paw blew off. The MPDs claim person has already called about fixing my back window on my truck but I feel like they should pay the vet bill too!!! He called them out of their yard. Then shot my baby girl. Because he was scared. Keep in mind this was during the day in the middle of subdivision. I&#039;m still shaken up by it all. I&#039;m just thankful my baby girl is gonna be ok.&quot; The post has received well over 400 comments and was shared across the social media outlet more than 12,000 times. This is the second dog-shooting incident involving an MPD officer within the past two months. The first occurred in Troutman in late August when an off-duty MPD officer shot a neighbor&rsquo;s dog that had come onto the officer&rsquo;s property. The officer shot a two-year-old German Shepherd several times wounding it. It was later euthanized.

Taylor said the dog came toward him &ldquo;in an aggressive manner,&rdquo; according to Officer Elizabeth Barnhardt with the Iredell County Animal Services and Control Department. He fired three shots at Drogo before the dog took off to the wood line of his property. &ldquo;Taylor then stated that the shepherd raised his head, and he didn&rsquo;t want it to suffer, so he shot it again,&rdquo; reads Barnhardt&#039;s report. Drogo belonged to Taylor&rsquo;s neighbor, Sherri Wiggins, who came to the scene as soon as Barnhardt called her. Wiggins said she had just installed an invisible fence for the dog and didn&rsquo;t know how her dog had escaped. She and her husband took Drogo to an emergency veterinarian in Huntersville. According to the report, Wiggins believed the act was one of animal cruelty since the dog was shot for the fourth time in its stomach. Tracy Jackson, head of Animals Services, contacted the county&rsquo;s district attorney&rsquo;s office, but no charges were pressed against Taylor since &ldquo;the dog was on the man&rsquo;s property, and the man feared for his life,&rdquo; the report said. Attempts to reach Wiggins were unsuccessful. The Statesville Record &amp; Landmark reported that she had Drogo euthanized. Jackson told Mooresville Weekly there were no witnesses to the shooting. Mooresville Police Chief Carl Robbins said Taylor used a personal weapon to shoot the dog and that the Mooresville Police Department is conducting an administrative investigation to see if any department policies were violated. &ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s strange to people,&quot; Robbins said. &quot;They think we should be doing a criminal investigation, but that&rsquo;s not in our jurisdiction.&quot;','http://mooresvilleweekly.com/news/2013/8/30/4156/police-officer-shoots-dog-in-troutman','Drogo','Tim Taylor','0','0',2,0,0,0,0,'Plain Clothes',3,3,0,0,2,0),(1280,'2007-04-10','Arizona','Bisbee','US Border Patrol',1,2,0,'Unconfirmed','The following is reproduced from the Associated Press: A Bisbee man has been charged with assault and interfering with a federal officer for allegedly tackling a U.S. Border Patrol agent who had shot his dog. Gil Nelson, 47, made an initial appearance Wednesday at U.S. District Court in Tucson on the charges stemming from an incident a day earlier in which Agent Jeremy Poser suffered a sprained little finger. According to a complaint filed by U.S. Attorneys, Poser was responding to an activated sensor in a wash near Nelson&rsquo;s home Tuesday afternoon when two dogs ran toward him. &ldquo;Poser started to walk backwards but the dogs kept running towards (him),&rdquo; the complaint says. &ldquo;Poser felt threatened and shot one of the dogs with his service weapon.&rdquo; The injured dog belonged to Nelson and ran toward his home after the shooting. The complaint said Nelson, running out of the house, jumped on Poser&rsquo;s back, putting him in a headlock while pulling back on his finger. Poser pepper-sprayed Nelson, who then let go, but grabbed the agent&rsquo;s hat and sunglasses before running back inside the house, the complaint says. Nelson was arrested after more agents arrived at the home. U.S. Attorneys spokesman Wyn Hornbuckle said Nelson remains in custody pending a detention hearing Friday. The agent&rsquo;s version of events was disputed by Nelson&rsquo;s friend who was at the home when the incident happened. Debbie Norman said she was in the house with Nelson when they heard a very loud shot and heard the dog yelp. Nelson brought the dog inside, then ran outside with Norman and another woman. She said the agent was running away. &ldquo;When Mr. Nelson screamed at him, the guy turned around and Mr. Nelson knocked the gun out of the guy&rsquo;s hand,&rdquo; Norman said. &ldquo;Then the guy Maced Mr. Nelson, who fell on the ground, and the guy got on his radio and said he had just been attacked by three citizens. The man lied from the very beginning.&rdquo; Norman said Nelson had confronted another Border Patrol agent earlier Tuesday and told him not to come onto his property, then called the Naco Border Patrol station and told them he didn&rsquo;t want agents coming near his home. &ldquo;Now Mr. Nelson is in jail, and I feel that it&rsquo;s a case of retaliation and harassment,&rdquo; Norman said. &ldquo;I feel like they set him up.&rdquo; Tucson sector spokesman Jesus &ldquo;Chuy&rdquo; Rodriguez, saying the Border Patrol is investigating the incident, said he could not comment on the specifics of the case.','https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Xip9jjrUOf8J:tucsoncitizen.com/morgue/2007/04/13/48073-2-accounts-same-result-dog-shot-border-agent-injured-bisbee-man-charged/+&amp;cd=2&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us','Unknown','Jeremy Poser','0','0',2,2,2,1,1,'Uniform',0,2,0,0,2,0),(1281,'2012-09-08','Texas','Lubbock','Lubbock Police Department, City of Lubbock Animal Services',1,2,1,'Unconfirmed','Police released the dash cam video of an officer shooting which killed a dog in the parking lot of United Supermarket, 5001 Marsha Sharp Freeway on September 8, 2012.

The dog placed myself and others in danger of serious bodily injury. I fired one round into the dog with my LPD-issued pistol.&quot; KCBD NewsChannel 11 received constant emails and phone calls about the incident. Although the dog&#039;s death seemed to be an outrage for many, we investigated police policy to see what the rules and regulations entailed when an officer used deadly force on an animal. Mayor Glen Robertson said he also received numerous complaints about the dog&#039;s death. &quot;As a Mayor, it puts me in a very tough situation. Because city charter is very clear that this goes to the police department, to the police chief, and to internal affairs to do any investigation if there&#039;s a process they go through,&quot; said Robertson. &quot;From that point, it goes to the City Manager and if it would ever need to get back to the Council, it would come from the City Manager to the Council and then to the Mayor. I really have no authority over police officer or police chief. So really, the only thing I can do in a situation like this, is to express my thoughts to the city manager and let it go from there.&quot; According to LPD Sgt. Jonathan Stewart, Lewis acted in good faith to promote public safety.  Although Animal Control was also called to the scene, police were the first on scene and according to Stewart action needed to be taken. &quot;I think it&#039;s something that goes into it and we do work often hand-in-hand with animal control.  And again, if there is a situation where public safety is in danger, and a police officer quickly responds, then obviously the Lubbock Police Department is going to quickly respond to that.&quot; KCBD NewsChannel 11 made an open records request for a partial copy of the police policies and procedures on deadly force. It said &quot;officers will attempt all those reasonable means of apprehension and control within their command before resorting to deadly force. However, officers will not unreasonably endanger members of the public or themselves in applying these rules in actual situations.&quot; Another section of the policy said &quot;officers may use deadly force to defend other persons or themselves from what the officer reasonably perceives as an immediate risk of death or serious bodily injury&hellip;&quot;  Another section specific to this case said &quot;officers may discharge firearms: to destroy animals threatening public or officer safety, or that are seriously injured.&quot; NewsChannel 11 asked why a second shot wasn&#039;t fired, to put the dog out of its misery. &quot;Well, the intent is never to kill, or shoot to kill, in this situation or any other. But, the intent is to stop the threat,&quot; said Stewart. We received a Facebook post from Karen Medina who claimed to be the owner of both dogs.We tried to contact Medina to find out why both her dogs were out fighting at United in the first place. She has not yet responded. Mayor Robertson added that drastic budget cuts have resulted in fewer Animal Control Officers to respond. &quot;We&#039;ve been in austerity mode for 10, 12 years around Lubbock, where we cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, and then we come up with situations like this one,&quot; said Robertson. &quot;And every time you cut, there&#039;s going to be some future price you have to pay,&quot; Robertson said.

I was outside and opened the door and my 2 Pit Bulls came outside&hellip; They did not bark, growl, charge at the officer or show any sign of aggression towards him... The officer yelled at me to grab my dog... I am 7 months pregnant&hellip; I bent down in time to grab him from the hips but it was to late the officer had already fired a shot that grazed my female pit bull on her lip and hit my other dog at the neck... He instantly went down, Not to mention that the officer could have shot me too while I was holding my dog. This all happened at my property, two steps away from my door. My husband ran outside and started yelling at the cop and asked him why he shot my dog and the officer said it was because &ldquo;HE WAS A PIT BULL&rdquo;... At this point I was on the ground holding Chino and telling him to cross over the rainbow bridge... My husband was running around the neighborhood looking for our injured pit bill... Once chino passed I started to tell the officers to please not to shoot my other dog that was able to get away from the officer. I also have to mention that after some time I was put in an ambulance because I was hyperventilating and the medics said that my blood pressure was elevated due to the situation, I also feared that anything would happen to my unborn baby. They asked to take me to the hospital but I refused to leave my dogs side, especially because one was still missing and was scared that the officers might shot her again. My husband was able to find my injured dog and had to take her to the emergency vet and got some stitches on her lip. The officer who took the shots disappeared after a while and I also have to say that the officers didn&rsquo;t seem to show any concern or remorse about what they did, first there were like 10 police cars but after a short time they were leaving and only 4 or 5 officers stayed back, and it didn&rsquo;t seem like a crime scene anymore because they were gathered around in a circle laughing and smiling. I don&rsquo;t know if they were making fun of my husband because he was running around the neighborhood looking for my injured dog. They were also rude to my husband telling him that they were going to arrest him because he was being agitated because he couldn&rsquo;t find our other dog and because now I was sitting in an ambulance fearing that something could happen to me or our unborn child. One officer even pushed my husband because he stepped over the crime scene yellow tape. They told him more than one time that they were going to arrest him but luckily my husband was able to avoid it. My husband has spent 8 years in the Marine Corps and has and idea how cops will find a reason to make an arrest. I&#039;m still in shock and not emotionally right after seeing my baby being shot and killed in front of me. My husband is not in his best mental state either and is doing whatever possible to find someone who can help us bring justice to our dogs. We ended up with veterinarian bills to get my other Pit Bull stitches and might have to take her back tomorrow because it&rsquo;s almost been 24 hours since the shooting and she won&rsquo;t eat or drink any water. I also had to miss work today because I&rsquo;m not emotionally stable to function at work and I might not be able to be working tomorrow either. I also have to see my doctor to make sure that everything is fine with me and my unborn baby, because I have been felling a pressure on my stomach and haven&rsquo;t been able to eat or sleep. Today we have been calling lawyer offices and went to the police station trying to file a report directly on the officer and they said the statements we made yesterday would be sufficient and they couldn&#039;t give us a copy...

The death of 50-pound Rocky spurred dog owner Frank Cisneros to complain to the Berkeley police internal affairs division, which will investigate his charge that police acted too aggressively and without regard for his family. A group of officers with a search warrant went to the Hayward home in the 23000 block of Jorgensen Lane about 9:15 a.m. Wednesday looking for evidence &mdash; possible spray paint cans and pens &mdash; related to an ongoing felony vandalism and graffiti case. Police are investigating 60 to 70 vandalism and tagging incidents that occurred in Berkeley earlier this month and had the warrant because they had reason to believe the Hayward house may somehow be linked to the case. Cisneros, 35, said his younger brother was arrested for a graffiti-related offense in Berkeley in 1996. The brother does not live at the house, and police did not have a warrant for his arrest. Cisneros, who was not home when about eight Berkeley officers and one Hayward officer came to his door, said his wife was headed out the front door to work when police arrived, and the dog began to squirm out the door. She tried to control him by the collar, he said. &quot;Had they given her 10 seconds to pull him in the house, everything would have been fine,&quot; Cisneros said. But police tell a different story. &quot;As the front door opened, the dog came out ... barking and growling, and ran toward (the officer),&quot; said Hayward Lt. Reid Lindblom. Berkeley police spokesman Joe Okies said there is no indication in the police report that anyone tried to &quot;physically restrain&quot; the dog. Okies said the dog came outside and charged at an officer. &quot;The dog got within two feet of the officer, and the officer shot the dog twice,&quot; he said. &quot;Basically we went there to serve a search warrant, and officers were confronted with a vicious pit bull and had to protect themselves.&quot; Dr. Carl Singer, a Hayward veterinarian, confirmed that Hayward Animal Control brought the dog to him, and it had died from two gunshot wounds to the chest and stomach.','http://www.insidebayarea.com/oaklandtribune/localnews/ci_2679409','Rocky','Unknown SWAT team','1','0',0,0,0,0,0,'Uniform',1,2,0,0,2,0),(1284,'2008-11-08','Illinois','Park Forest','Park Forest Police Department',1,50,1,'German Shepard and Pit Bull mix','From the Chicago Tribune: A Park Forest detective searching for a burglar in a residential backyard over the weekend accidentally killed a family&#039;s pet dog after the German shepherd-pit bull mix allegedly lunged at him, Park Forest Deputy Police Chief Mike McNamara said Wednesday.

The lawsuit seeks $250,000 in damages from Chicago Police Officer Matthew Bracken. Audrey Fisher and her 12-year-old daughter, Fayla Rodriguez, took Willy, their 2 1/2-year-old Pomeranian-Papillon mix, to the dog beach on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day so he could play with his favorite pink ball. But another dog owner&rsquo;s pit bull wanted that ball, and attacked the 8-pound dog. &ldquo;A pit bull came out of nowhere and just attacked him, grabbed him by his belly and shook him violently,&rdquo; Fisher said in an interview with CBS 2 after the attack. According to the family&rsquo;s lawsuit filed in Cook County on Tuesday, Bracken&rsquo;s pit bull repeatedly attacked Willy, biting down on his stomach and shaking him. The family&rsquo;s attorney, Manotti Jenkins, said the police officer at first yelled at a bystander for trying to stop the attack, &ldquo;apparently more concerned about the fact that a bystander was attempting to remove his dog from the plaintiff&rsquo;s dog. He used profanity. When the plaintiff was attempting to get her dog to medical attention, the defendant showed no remorse.&rdquo; Willy died three days later. &ldquo;They had the dog for about two-and-a-half years. It was a small dog. The dog was very close to them. It had become a part of their family,&rdquo; Jenkins said. &ldquo;They spent a lot of time with the dog in the house, allowed the dog to sleep in the bed with them; spent a lot of their free time out at the park.&rdquo; Afterward, Fisher was left with a $5,700 vet bill, because the owner of the pit bull refused to identify himself and left the beach. Chicago Park District rules stipulate owners of dogs that attack other animals at dog parks must foot the vet bills, and Fisher hopes to have the pit bull&rsquo;s owner held financially responsible. Jenkins said Officer Bracken did not restrain his pit bull, did not show remorse, and did not take responsibility. He allegedly left the beach after the attack, and the family spent weeks trying to track him down. On April 17, police said the officer turned himself in and told police about his involvement in the attack at Montrose Beach. Without naming him publicly at the time, the police Animal Crimes Team ticketed the officer for not making notification within 24 hours after an animal has bitten another domestic animal, according to a police News Affairs statement. He was also relieved of his police powers, pending an Internal Affairs investigation.

Bixby, Okla., Police Chief Anthony Stephens decided to fire Cory Forister after Tulsa TV stations aired video of the officer making an obscene gesture to camera crews. Reporters were covering a canine-aggression class Forister was ordered to attend following his shooting of a golden retriever during a burglary investigation earlier this month. The dog, named Fluppy, had to be euthanized. According to KOTV-TV, station reporter Patrina Adger sought comment from Forister about the case. Adger: &ldquo;Officer Forister, do you want to talk about what you&rsquo;re learning from the class?&rdquo; Forister: &ldquo;No, thank you.&rdquo; Adger: &ldquo;Are you learning anything from the class?&rdquo; Forister: &ldquo;I just told you, I don&rsquo;t want an interview.&rdquo; Footage from the meeting showed Forister resting his head in his hand, with his middle finger extended. The police chief says he was flooded with calls after the gesture was broadcast, and he was forced to let Forister go for conduct unbecoming of a police officer. &ldquo;This type of conduct by a police officer cannot, and will not, be tolerated, under any circumstances,&rdquo; Stephens said. Forister denies intentionally &ldquo;flipping off&rdquo; the reporter. According to KTUL-TV, the saga began June 5 as Forister was responding to a possible burglary at the home of John and Kathy Benzinger. He then saw the family pet, which was tied to a cable as it lunged at him. &ldquo;I yelled three times at the dog, &lsquo;back, back, back,&rsquo; and I was running backwards as fast as I could,&rdquo; Forister told KTUL. He says Fluppy was on a long tether and was less than two feet away when he fired three shots. &ldquo;It all happened in a matter of about four seconds,&rdquo; Forister told KTUL. &ldquo;It was instant. When I felt like my life was at risk, my personal safety at risk.&rdquo; The city investigated the shooting and concluded no criminal charges should be filed against the officer. &ldquo;As far as we are concerned, we&rsquo;ve conducted an investigation, held a review hearing, issued a finding, and that&rsquo;s the end of it,&rdquo; City Attorney Jim Frasier told the Tulsa World. The Benzingers have since obtained another golden retriever puppy, as the family children pooled their money to purchase one. &ldquo;[Forister] has still refused to call us and issue an apology!&rdquo; John Benzinger lamented to KOTV, though the police department itself has issued an apology. He says the family is still considering a civil lawsuit to cover Fluppy&rsquo;s veterinary and cremation bills, reportedly worth over $1,000. The case has been a hot topic in Oklahoma, sparking plenty of discussion and letters to the editor of the Tulsa World, including one by Tulsa resident James Blazer. &ldquo;When a Bixby police officer, one Cory Forister, shoots a golden retriever because it comes too close, then I would not want him to even have access to a gun, much less be authorized to use it,&rdquo; Blazer wrote. &ldquo;The dog killed in Bixby was tethered and could not reach him and, more important, it was a golden retriever, which is just about as dangerous as a 2-month-old baby.&rdquo;','http://www.wnd.com/2004/07/25356/','Fluppy','Cory Forister','2','0',2,0,0,0,0,'Uniform',2,2,1,1,2,0),(1295,'2003-06-14','Wisconsin','Milwaukee','Milwaukee Police Department',1,30,0,'Cocker Spaniel, 6yo','A dog owner is calling for a criminal investigation into the lethal shooting of her 6-year-old cocker spaniel by a police officer. Valerie Mueller was in her backyard with her dog Sprite in the early morning hours last Saturday trying to talk a friend out of suicide when police arrived, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. The 38-pound dog bounded into the front yard toward the officers as they got out of their squad cars and just seconds later was struck by a bullet and killed. &quot;He fell over and flinched,&quot; Mueller, 33, told the Milwaukee paper. &quot;To see him fall over flinching and die right there, it&#039;s just hard to explain.&quot; On top of her loss, police issued Mueller a $120 citation for allowing Sprite to be outside without a leash. The Milwaukee Police Department is now investigating whether lethal force was necessary to subdue the dog, the Journal Sentinel said. Mueller&#039;s attorney Alan Eisenberg called the shooting &quot;reckless&quot; and filed a complaint Wednesday with the city&#039;s Fire and Police Commission. He also is asking the Milwaukee County district attorney to conduct a criminal investigation. The Milwaukee daily said Mueller&#039;s dog-shooting complaint is the first the commission has received this year. Last year, the commission probed three shootings of dogs by police officers. Another friend of Mueller&#039;s, David Williams, witnessed the shooting. &quot;I told [police], &#039;The dog is harmless, don&#039;t hurt the dog,&#039;&quot; Williams said. &quot;Three seconds later, they shot the dog.&quot; The Journal Sentinel said Sprite was so much a part of Mueller&#039;s life that she had his paw prints tattooed onto her right foot. &quot;He was my best friend,&quot; she told the paper. &quot;I did everything with him.&quot; The female officer who shot the dog, Chaquila C.

While Jax likely did walk out of the dog door into the yard and bark at the two officers, Coleman also said his pet was just a month into recovery after spinal surgery and not in physical condition to attack anybody. Coleman said he suspects the officer -- who fired off at least 8 rounds -- was scared of dogs. &quot;I know he (Jax) didn&#039;t get shot for attacking this guy,&quot; he said, adding that the NOPD needs to look at their policy for approaching animals on private property. &quot;I don&#039;t want anybody else&#039;s animal to get shot for barking in their backyard.&quot; Officer Sabrina Richardson, an NOPD public information officer, said the dog growled and charged at the officer who eventually fired. &quot;If your dog does not receive people well, you need to secure that animal because an officer has to protect his or her life,&quot; Richardson said. &quot;It is an unfortunate accident, but one of those things that couldn&#039;t be protected in this case.&quot; The officers, responding to the house alarm, were approaching the house from the backyard when two dogs came out of the dog door into the fenced yard, Richardson said. The bigger dog, the male Jax, is the one who charged, she said. Police were called after either Jax or his female Doberman, Scarlett, likely tripped the alarm at one of the front windows, Coleman said. He installed the alarm after an attempted break-in six months ago, in part as a measure to protect his pets. Coleman was meeting with a patient at his medical practice on Monday morning when he received a phone call from a neighbor saying his dog had been shot. When he arrived to his house on Catina Street, at least 10 officers were milling around his house. He counted eight bullet casings in his backyard. He found Jax laying on the floor of the house, where the dog ran after being shot. Jax was barely alive and died while his owner attempted to administer CPR. Officers with the Louisiana SPCA arrived at the scene after the incident and have requested a copy of the police report, said Ana Zorrilla, the group&#039;s chief executive officer. But the group currently has no evidence of any wrongdoing by the NOPD officers, she said. Many people have misconceptions about large breeds like Dobermans, believing them to be more dangerous than other animals, Zorrilla said. The group advises dog owners to post signs on their property indicating they own dogs, in part to alert law enforcement to the presence of animals. While many of his neighbors had begun to post &quot;Beware of Dogs&quot; signs on Tuesday, Coleman said he doesn&#039;t want to follow suit. &quot;I don&#039;t want people to beware of my dogs,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#039;m not using my dogs as protection dogs.&quot;','http://www.nola.com/news/index.ssf/2008/04/nopd_officer_shoots_pet_doberm.html','Jax','Two unknown police','0','0',0,0,0,0,0,'Uniform',0,0,2,2,2,0),(1297,'2008-10-13','Arizona','Mesa','Mesa Police Department',1,2,1,'Unconfirmed','Mesa officers shot and killed a dog Monday after the animal became aggressive and lunged at several people, police said.

Capone belonged to Andrea Coleman. After shooting Capone, police seized Andrea Coleman&#039;s other dog Momba and issued her a number of fines for unregistered dogs. The killer, Mike Murphy, had been involved with at least one other shooting incident. Murphy shot a man on 727 North Michigan St. in November, 2006. Police allege that the man Murphy shot was brandishing a pistol. From the Toledo Blade: Late yesterday morning, Andrea Coleman heard an unexpected knock on her door. A woman - whom she had never met before - was standing on her porch in North Toledo, offering to help pay to get her Rottweiler, Momba, out of the pound. The 9-month-old dog was confiscated Monday by a Lucas County deputy dog warden because it was unlicensed and loose. The woman handed Ms. Coleman $90 and left. &quot;She said, &#039;Go get your puppy,&#039;&bull;&quot; Ms. Coleman said. A few minutes later, there was another knock from a second woman who also wanted to help. Several people also called The Blade yesterday asking how they could assist Ms. Coleman in getting her dog back. Still grieving from the loss of her boxer, Capone, who was fatally shot by Toledo police Officer Mike Murphy in the driveway of 3323 Mulberry St. on Monday, Ms. Coleman said she was overwhelmed by the support she has received. &quot;I wanted to cry,&quot; she said. &quot;I&#039;ve never experienced so much support.&quot; Police went to the Mulberry address about 4:25 p.m. in response to a roaming-dog complaint from a resident there who reported the dog as &quot;possibly vicious.&quot; Officer Murphy shot Capone three times after the dog charged the officer, &quot;barking and acting in a vicious manner,&quot; according to an incident report. Momba was taken from the scene after the shooting. Dr. Gary Thompson, a veterinarian at the West Suburban Animal Clinic in Sylvania, said boxers aren&#039;t any more dangerous than other breeds. &quot;It is generally a wonderful breed and has very little history of any problems,&quot; Dr. Thompson said, adding boxers are often bred as hunting dogs. Both of Ms. Coleman&#039;s dogs were kept inside her home throughout the winter and she said they were not vicious animals. After Capone&#039;s shooting, Ms. Coleman said she didn&#039;t have the money needed to spring Momba from the pound. But with the anonymous gift, she and her sister, Eleanor Dixon, headed to the dog warden&#039;s office yesterday afternoon. Tom Skeldon, the county dog warden, agreed to drop the fines and the running-at-large violation if Ms. Coleman purchased a $25 dog license and paid a $25 fine, required by state law, for not previously licensing her dog. &quot;I feel sorry for her,&quot; Mr. Skeldon said. When police receive dog complaints, Mr. Skeldon said someone from his office initially responds. But if the complaint is made after the warden&#039;s closes at 4 p.m., police respond, he said. About 3 p.m. yesterday, an anxious Ms. Coleman was taken inside the kennel to identify her dog, a standard procedure used by the dog warden&#039;s office when people come to pick up their animal. As she walked through several rows of cages, Momba stood silent in a cage at the back of the room - until he saw his owner. Then, he started barking and jumping around. &quot;[Are] you ready to go home?&quot; Ms. Coleman asked Momba, bending down to his level. &quot;He&#039;s so ready. Momba has never barked so much in his life.&quot; After getting the license and paying the fine, Ms. Coleman and her sister left the dog warden&#039;s office, loaded Momba into their car, and headed home. Ms. Coleman said they could not be happier. &quot;I really thought I was going to lose my dog,&quot; she said. The shooting involving Capone will be reviewed by police commanders and submitted to the Firearms Review Board. The police department&#039;s manual states that officers may use a firearm to destroy &quot;a dangerous animal that poses an immediate threat to the officer,&quot; and also &quot;a seriously injured animal where humanity requires its relief from further suffering.&quot; Although all patrol officers carry Tasers, Chief Mike Navarre said it likely would have been ineffective against a charging dog. He was unsure if Officer Murphy had his Taser on Monday. For a Taser to work, Chief Navarre said both probes have to strike the target. &quot;Shooting a dog with a Taser is very impractical,&quot; he said. &quot;You would have to be an expert shot and still have a lot of luck to be able to hit the front of the dog.&quot; The chief did not know how many dogs are fatally shot by Toledo police officers each year. Officer Murphy was reviewed last year for firing his service weapon and striking a man twice during an incident at 727 North Michigan St. in November, 2006. According to police, Charles Johnson of West Toledo refused to show police his hands and then displayed a handgun off to his side. He was shot when he pointed the gun at Officer Murphy, who had ordered him to drop the weapon. The Firearms Review Board unanimously decided Officer Murphy was justified in shooting the man, police said. Staff writer Alex M.

Spencer said the dog apparently attacked Poster and her 16-year-old daughter, Tiffani Bowkett, when they became involved in an argument. Police had responded to similar incidents regarding the dog and the family. Both Poster and Bowkett suffered injuries to their extremities and other areas of the body.

Thursday&#039;s attack comes on the heels of discussions in Scottsbluff among the city council earlier this month about stiffening penalties against dog owners that have violated ordinances for pets and violent animals.

Durham, a 45-pound Labrador retriever, was fatally shot Thursday. It happened after a neighbor called 911 to report the dog was in her yard and barking. An officer arrived and called for backup when Durham barked at him, the neighbor said. Durham then walked back to his owner&rsquo;s yard. When the second officer arrived, Durham went back into the neighbor&rsquo;s yard. Colby Mangum, who owned 2-year-old Durham, said police told her that Durham then showed his teeth and lunged at the officers. That is when one of the officers shot and killed the dog. &quot;I came to the backyard when I heard the first shot,&rdquo; neighbor Annette Outlaw said. Outlaw said she found the two officers with a gun and Durham&#039;s lifeless body about 25 feet away. &quot;I told him, he didn&#039;t have to shoot him, that he wasn&#039;t vicious. He says, &#039;He was within his rights to shoot the dog, because he showed his teeth,&#039;&rdquo; Outlaw said. Outlaw said the officers put the dog in a plastic bag and left him on the side of the road. &quot;When the shift supervisor came by later that night, I asked him how would you feel if that were your dog? And he said, &#039;What else were we supposed to do with him,&#039;&rdquo; Mangum said. Mangum said she has collected written statements from neighbors saying Durham was not vicious. However, neighbor Bobbie Jean Dixon says this wasn&#039;t the first time police were called about Durham. She says he has chased her family before. &quot;He was a vicious dog, (and) frightened us and our children,&rdquo; she said.

And I want to express that to Ms. Mangum about her dog being killed,&rdquo; Schroeder said. Mangum said she questions why animal control officers were not called first to pick up the animal, instead of the police.

The case is No. F030635, THE PEOPLE v. OCTAVIO JAMAL HENDERSON. The case describes a chaotic scene that began with a domestic altercation. A grandmother lived with a number of family members, including two adult sons, a 10 year old child, and at least one other woman. The grandmother called the police, accusing one of her adult sons with threatening her. When police arrived, they quickly escalated the already precarious situation by proceeding to arrest the elderly grandmother who had in fact called them for assistance. At that point, it is disputed whether the entire family began attacking the police, with a walking stick, a chair and eventually with a dog, or if the police threatened to kill the families dogs and their attempts to &quot;resist arrest&quot; were, in fact, attempts to prevent them from opening fire on the dogs. In any event, this was one of the first cases in which police charged someone with brandishing a deadly weapon for merely holding a dog in the presence of police.\r\n\r\nThe Prosecution&#039;s Case-in-Chief\r\n\r\nOn October 31, 1997, Kern County Sheriff&#039;s Deputy Hakker was dispatched to 3108 Lexington Avenue to investigate a report of two men fighting with sticks. The fight was reported to be over an elderly female. On his arrival, Deputy Hakker learned that Terry Henderson, his brother (appellant), and the mother of the two men, Margaret Long, were involved in the altercation. The problem was temporarily resolved with the removal of Terry Henderson from the residence. Later that day, Terry Henderson called 911 from the house and reported that his mother was threatening to shoot him with a gun. A female, who subsequently identified herself as Margaret Long, then got on the phone and told the dispatcher she was going to blow the male caller&#039;s head off. Officers were immediately dispatched to the 3108 Lexington Avenue address to investigate, while the dispatcher tried to keep Ms. Long on the phone. Ms. [76 Cal. App. 4th 457] Long put the phone down but, for officer safety reasons, the dispatcher stayed on the line and listened. Deputy Hakker was the first officer on the scene. Deputy Money arrived a short time later. Deputy Hakker contacted Terry Henderson on the sidewalk in front of the residence. Terry reported that he had returned to the residence to pick up a few of his belongings when he and appellant got into another fight. Terry reported that Ms. Long then pointed a handgun at his head and threatened to shoot him. As Deputy Hakker approached the front of the residence, he could see Ms. Long through the closed security door. She was sitting on the couch talking on the phone. The deputy heard her direct someone to let him in. Posted at the front door was a sign with a handgun pointed in the direction of the visitor that said, &quot;Don&#039;t worry about the dog, beware of owner.&quot; Deputy Hakker entered the residence and asked Ms. Long about the location of the gun. Ms. Long, agitated and upset, held up her arm and said, &quot;Here it is; it is my walking stick.&quot; She then threw down the stick and the phone while continuing to scream and yell. Deputy Hakker continued to believe there was a gun in the house, despite Ms. Long&#039;s protestations to the contrary. In an effort to defuse the situation, Deputy Hakker ordered Ms. Long to leave the living room where the other family members were located and join him in the doorway. As Ms. Long began to walk towards the officers, several family members began yelling that he was not to arrest their mother. Deputy Hakker tried to explain that he was only going to put her in his patrol vehicle until things quieted down. Somewhere between seven and nine family members, including appellant, then began pulling Ms. Long out of the deputy&#039;s grasp and back into the residence. About this time, Deputy Lostaunau arrived on the scene. Deputy Money, meanwhile, positioned himself just outside the front door. But when Deputy Hakker, looking frightened, called for his help, he moved just inside the residence and kept his leashed dog Jet just outside the door. Some family members, including appellant, threatened to &quot;kick [Deputy Hakker&#039;s] ass.&quot; Deputy Hakker was only five to eight feet away from appellant when the latter said, &quot;Someone shoot that motherfucker.&quot; [76 Cal. App. 4th 458] Deputy Hakker watched as appellant walked out of the living room and to the back door of the residence. When appellant returned, he was dragging a full size, white pit bull by the collar. The dog had its front feet off the ground as it growled at Deputy Hakker and tried to break free of appellant&#039;s hold. They were only six to ten feet away from Deputy Hakker at this time. Appellant seemed to be trying to keep the dog agitated; so agitated that if he let go, the dog would attack the deputy. The dog continued to growl, snap and bark at the officer. Appellant repeatedly told Deputy Hakker to let Ms. Long go or he would let the dog loose. Appellant, still extremely agitated and upset, was very clear regarding his intentions. The deputy feared for his personal safety and warned appellant that he would shoot the dog if it was released. Appellant then picked up the dog and, carrying it on his right side, got within three feet of Deputy Hakker. The deputy feared he would be bitten if they got any closer as the dog continued to snap at him while it tried to break free. So, the deputy pulled out his pepper spray and warned appellant one last time to put the dog away. Appellant came within one and one-half feet of the officer. He then turned and, as he passed the officer, told the deputy he would be sorry if he did not release his mother Ms. Long. Appellant then secured the dog in one of the bedrooms and returned to the living room. Deputy Hakker kept on with his efforts to get Ms. Long out of the residence, but continued to meet with opposition from other family members. One of them, a 10-year-old boy, grabbed Ms. Long&#039;s walking stick and swung it at the deputy&#039;s head, missing it by only a few inches. Appellant joined in the yelling and told Deputy Hakker that he had &quot;no motherfucking right&quot; and to &quot;[k]ill the motherfucker.&quot; Appellant came at Deputy Hakker as the latter exited the residence with a cooperative Ms. Long. Appellant, still in an extremely agitated state, continued to yell at the deputy. When he got within three feet, Deputy Money sprayed appellant with pepper spray. Jet, Deputy Money&#039;s canine partner, apparently got so excited by all the yelling and pulling that he bit Deputy Hakker without being commanded to bite anyone. Deputy Hakker had worked with this dog regularly and had never seen the dog so upset. Deputy Money, however, said he had seen the dog that excited in training. He believed the dog may have bitten in this case because Deputy Hakker backed into him. Deputy Hakker finally secured Ms. Long in his patrol vehicle. He then returned to the residence intending to arrest appellant for his actions against him and for assaulting Terry Henderson. [76 Cal. App. 4th 459] When Deputy Hakker entered the house, appellant ran to the side yard where he grabbed a white or gray adult pit bull. fn. 2 With this deputy in pursuit, appellant carried the dog to the three-foot fence in the front yard and held it near the top while shaking it. He pointed the dog in the direction of Deputies Money and Lostaunau, who were on the other side of the fence, and threatened to let it go so it could attack or kill each of the deputies and Deputy Money&#039;s canine partner, Jet. Deputy Lostaunau was only a foot away from the fence when appellant first put the dog up there, but backed up a few feet. Appellant was extremely upset and kept shaking the pit bull, which was already extremely agitated. The pit bull continued to snap and bark while it tried to pull itself over the fence to get to the two deputies on the other side. Appellant was told to put the dog down. Deputy Money, who was seven to ten feet away from Deputy Lostaunau, drew his sidearm and, fearing an attack, told appellant he would shoot the dog if appellant released it. fn. 3 He had no doubt that appellant was threatening him with the dog. He never heard appellant claim to be holding the dog back to prevent injury to the officers. Deputy Lostaunau told appellant he was under arrest and, also fearing an attack by the dog, sprayed the pit bull with pepper spray. The dog then got free of appellant&#039;s grasp. According to Deputy Hakker, appellant ran into the house at this time. Deputy Lostaunau, on the other hand, said appellant began to pick up another pit bull and did not run for the house until after the deputy sprayed the entire area with pepper spray. About this time, a black labrador sprinted out of the front door and straight towards Deputy Money and his canine partner, Jet, who were now in the street in front of the house. According to Deputy Lostaunau, the labrador was not drooling or barking; he merely ran like one dog would run to another. Deputy Money, however, said the dog was running low to the ground. He was not sure the labrador could see Jet, because he was on the other side of a car that was parked in front of the residence. Deputy Money yelled for someone to get the labrador but there was no time. Within seconds, the deputy fired his gun at the dog. Deputy Money said he did not realize it was a labrador until after he shot it; he thought it was one of the pit bulls. Even though the dog was struck twice, it was not killed and limped away. Meanwhile, Deputy Hakker tried to gain entry into the house but found the front security door locked. He found the side door locked as well but [76 Cal. App. 4th 460] kicked it in and, along with Deputy Lostaunau, pursued appellant into a bedroom. Deputy Lostaunau said appellant knew the officers were trying to gain entry and deliberately shut the door in their faces. When the officers reached the bedroom, they found the door closed. They ordered appellant to open the door but he refused, saying he had to hold back the dogs so they would not attack the officers. This was the first time appellant had made such a claim. Deputy Lostaunau reminded appellant that he was under arrest and directed him to come out. When Deputy Hakker kicked open this door, he was met by two charging pit bulls. Another white pit bull and the injured black labrador, who were also in the room, did not join in. fn. 4 Deputy Lostaunau sprayed both charging dogs with pepper spray and directed appellant to come out with his hands behind his back. Appellant finally complied and the officers were able to handcuff him. They experienced no other problems with appellant after this point. Once everything calmed down, appellant told Deputy Lostaunau that the officers had misunderstood his actions. Appellant said he was not trying to interfere and specifically denied having threatened the officers. He claimed to have been holding the dogs back to protect the officers. Deputy Lostaunau never saw appellant do anything that was consistent with this last claim. Deputy Hakker characterized the dogs at the house as vicious. He said they were extremely agitated and trying very hard to get loose while growling and snapping at the officers. He confessed to being afraid of these dogs and appellant. Since this incident, the Lexington residence has been given the special designation of &quot;hazard,&quot; which means a minimum of two officers will be dispatched whenever they are summoned there. The next prosecution witness testified about dogs. Mr. Hanks, a professional dog trainer for approximately 30 years, said he has trained dogs for field work and various types of law enforcement work. For the past eight years, he has worked as a Kern County Animal Control Officer and, for the last four years, as an investigator for the department. In this latter capacity, it is his responsibility to investigate claims of animal cruelty and illegal [76 Cal. App. 4th 461] animal fighting. As a result, he has learned a lot about labradors and pit bulls. Most of the blood sports cases he has studied and investigated have involved pit bulls. He explained that a pit bull trained to fight in a ring is typically animal aggressive and people friendly. Their untrained counterpart is generally very animal aggressive (this seems to be the dog&#039;s nature) and is not always people friendly. Whether a pit bull will be people friendly seems, in large part, to be dependent upon the manner in which it is raised. He personally does not consider them to be people friendly dogs due to his involvement in serious altercations with pit bulls on a day-to-day basis. He also found that they can be very protective of people and property. When asked whether the pit bull has the capacity to cause great bodily injury or death to a human, Mr. Hanks replied, &quot;Most definitely.&quot; He had just published an article with the Humane Society of the United States on the biting power of various breeds of dogs. He noted that it only takes four pounds of pressure per square inch to break a human&#039;s finger. The biting power of the german shepherd is 900 to 1,200 pounds per square inch, the rottweiler is 1,700 to 1,800 pounds per square inch, and the pit bull has the most powerful bite at 2,400 to 2,500 pounds per square inch. Pit bulls can crush bones and inflict great bodily harm or death. Mr. Hanks also cited to the all too frequent news report of pit bulls mauling someone. Dealing with pit bulls can be far more dangerous than other breeds because they have a locking mechanism in their jaw. Once they grab hold, they normally will not let go, but will instead keep biting and shaking. If they get into a frenzy, they lose sight of what they are doing, whereas other breeds will normally bite and back off. Mr. Hanks had also encountered vicious labradors. He has found they can be aggressive when it comes to protecting property and are also capable of inflicting great bodily injury to a person. He also said labradors can be animal aggressive; while this does not happen on a regular basis, it does happen frequently. It has a lot to do with the dog&#039;s temperament. Mr. Hanks was then asked how he would respond, as a dog handler, if a labrador were running right at him and he could not get it to stop. Knowing the dog was capable of causing considerable harm, he said he would shoot it if that is what it took to stop the animal and protect himself. He has had to shoot dogs that have come at him when other means of deterrence were not effective, although he has never shot a labrador. He acknowledged that it is common for a dog to run up to an unknown dog to investigate, particularly if the strange dog is on the first dog&#039;s property. [76 Cal. App. 4th 462] Mr. Hanks also admitted that dogs tend to get excited if there is a lot of confusion going on around them. Depending on the circumstances, they also could get very excited if another dog was around. The correct thing to do is to restrain the animal if it gets excited. Mr. Hanks believed pit bulls could be restrained. He was then asked whether an owner could hold a dog in such a way as to agitate it or make it more aggressive. Mr. Hanks said that holding an animal by its collar while lunging it at something and commanding it to do something would be one way to accomplish that goal.\r\n\r\nThe Defense Case\r\n\r\nAppellant&#039;s mother, Ms. Long, testified that, at the time of this incident, she was sharing the Lexington Avenue residence with appellant, her daughter, and some children. She also had a number of dogs, which she raised to be pets, not vicious animals. She volunteered that she did not fight her dogs and would not let anyone else do so either. At the time of this incident, she had a pit bull named Hercules, which she bought as a pet for her 10-year-old grandson, Eric. Hercules no longer lived with them, as someone had stolen him. She also had a pit bull named Leo that slept with her and loved to give kisses. She had two black dogs a trained black labrador named Logan and another black dog named Michael Belly or Touchie. She kept Leo indoors all the time because she &quot;got a little aggressive&quot; after being spayed. Ms. Long was not sure how she would react when someone came to the door, so they locked her up whenever someone came to visit. Leo had not been attack trained. Ms. Long admitted having a sign at her front door that said something about guns but denied having any in the house. She said she hated guns and had broken appellant&#039;s into pieces. Ms. Long said she called 911 the first time on that day in October because Terry and appellant had gotten into a fight using sticks. She said things settled down temporarily once Deputy Hakker removed Terry from the residence. However, when Terry returned, he told her that he was going to get her. He then called 911 and told the dispatcher that she had a gun to his head. Ms. Long took the phone away from him and told the dispatcher that she did [76 Cal. App. 4th 463] not own a gun. At trial, she denied even having her walking stick with her at the time. She said the only thing she had that he might have thought was a gun was a pencil. Ms. Long said she asked the dispatcher to send an officer out to the residence because Terry was trying to kill her. The dispatcher said he would send someone and directed Ms. Long to open the door for the officers and to stay on the line until they arrived. She said the officers arrived and immediately asked about the location of the gun. She told them she did not have a gun and unbuttoned her pants to prove it. Ms. Long later admitted telling the dispatcher she had a gun so she would get them to respond more quickly. The prosecutor then asked her if she later told the dispatcher that she did not have a gun but had a good knife she could get if he (presumably referring to Terry) came back through the door. Ms. Long said she did tell the officer about not having a gun but denied making the rest of the statement. When told the 911 tape would be played for her, Ms. Long retreated from her unwavering denial, to a position of not remembering having made the statement, and to finally admitting that she did make the comment. Ms. Long said the officer then grabbed her arms, handcuffed one of them and explained that he only wanted to talk to her. As he began to lead her out of the house, the grandchildren tried to pull her back inside. Ms. Long acknowledged that appellant had Leo (or Cleo) in his arms at this time, but claimed he was merely trying to restrain the dog. Leo was not barking and made no attempt to bite anyone at that time although she &quot;would have&quot; had she been let go. Ms. Long initially said appellant did not threaten the officers; he merely asked the officers not to hurt her. She understood how someone could make a mistake about what was said, given all the confusion at the time. A short time later, however, she said she did not hear him threaten the officer; that it was so loud some things may not have been clear for anyone. But her testimony made it clear she could hear what her grandchildren were saying and she was sure they had not threatened the officer. She was finally seated in the patrol car, but could still see the house. She did not see appellant either at the front fence holding a dog or in the backyard. She later admitted that she would not have been able to see him if he had been at a certain location in the yard. She also said Deputy Money may have blocked her view of appellant when the deputy was leaning over the gate and spraying her dogs for no reason. He had also threatened to kill the dogs for no reason. On redirect examination, Ms. Long said Deputy [76 Cal. App. 4th 464] Hakker threatened to kill the dogs for no reason. Defense counsel then asked her, &quot;So if somebody at the scene said kill the motherfuckers&quot; and before he could finish she replied, &quot;It could have been the officer talking about killing my dogs, that is right. That is the truth.&quot; Ms. Long was, however, able to see Logan dart out of the house and run towards the dog with the officer. Logan was not in an aggressive or attack stance she would have recognized that type of stance. She admitted having told an investigator that Logan had escaped through the backyard gate, but testified at trial that he came out of the front door. In making this admission, Ms. Long said she had thought about it and that she was &quot;fifty-some years old. I try to tell the truth as much as I can.&quot; It was her opinion that if appellant locked the doors around the house, he did so to keep the dogs in, not to keep the officers out. Ms. Long denied having any problems with law enforcement. She said she may have made a comment like &quot;[l]et them motherfuckers in because they don&#039;t really give a damn[,]&quot; while still on the phone with the dispatcher. If she did so, it was because she was upset and there were times when the officers would either not come or do what she wanted them to do when they did respond to her calls. She also had negative things to say about Deputy Hakker&#039;s handling of the first incident between Terry and appellant. She faulted him for not doing anything to Terry even though he had threatened to kill her or inflict great bodily harm. She also said she initially intended to file a complaint against Deputy Hakker and the other officer regarding their handling of the incident that led to the charges being filed in this case. She had already received the paperwork to do so when Deputy Hakker came by and apologized. She said he also told her that he was dropping the charges against her and her daughter but was going to get appellant. Her very next comment was that the officer was so decent she decided not to pursue her complaint against him. Eleven-year-old Eric Davis was the next witness to testify for the defense. He remembered the day in question and identified a white pit bull named Hercules as his dog. He saw appellant holding Hercules near the front fence. Eric said appellant went to pick the dog up because the officers were spraying the dogs. Appellant did not point the dog at anyone or over the fence. He instead handed the dog to Eric, who then took him to the back room of the house. [76 Cal. App. 4th 465] Eric initially denied trying to hit Deputy Hakker with his grandmother&#039;s walking stick, but later admitted telling the deputy (after things had calmed down) that he did it because he did not want the officer to take his grandmother away. He denied trying to hit the same officer with a white chair when they were in front of the residence. When asked where the brown pit bull Cleo was during this incident, Eric said she was initially chained up in the backyard but that appellant had removed the chain. Eric was asked whether the dog was taken off its chain when the police came back outside. He replied, &quot;Yes, and he was taking them in a room.&quot; Randy Westmorland, appellant&#039;s fianc&eacute;e, who had one felony conviction for receiving stolen property in 1994, also testified for the defense. She said Deputy Hakker entered the house while Ms. Long was still on the phone with the dispatcher. He asked Ms. Long where the gun was located, and when she told him she did not have one, he directed her to stand and put her hands behind her back. The grandchildren started asking why their grandmother was being arrested, and everything escalated from there. It was about this time that appellant picked up Cleo, who was in the living room with them, and put her in the back room. She did not hear appellant verbally threaten the officer with the dog or push it in the officer&#039;s direction. There were no other dogs in the house at this time. Appellant did, however, come into the house with Hercules just as Deputy Hakker kicked in the side door. Ms. Westmorland said appellant was just putting the dog in the room to keep him away from the officer. She had no personal knowledge whether appellant ever threatened the officers with a dog.\r\n\r\nThe Prosecution&#039;s Rebuttal Case\r\n\r\nDeputy Hakker testified that he did not make a special trip to apologize to Ms. Long about this incident. He had been dispatched to the house on Thanksgiving Day to investigate a claim that one of the Hendersons had stabbed another one. He denied apologizing to her about the incident which led to the present charges being filed or making any admissions that the officers had acted inappropriately in handling the matter. What he did tell Ms. Long was that the entire incident could have been avoided had appellant not made matters worse. He denied telling Ms. Long that he was going to get appellant. As for the other family members, he told her that it was up to the district attorney&#039;s office to decide whether they would be prosecuted. [76 Cal. App. 4th 466] The deputy then examined the photograph of Cleo, the brown pit bull. He said he had never seen that dog before. The dogs he was threatened with were either white or gray. Deputy Money was recalled and denied having threatened to kill all the animals. He said he only threatened to kill the dog that appellant threatened him with and did so at the time the threat was being made.','http://law.justia.com/cases/california/court-of-appeal/4th/76/453.html','Hercules, Leo AKA Cleo, Logan, Michael Belly AKA Touchie','Deputy Hakker, K9 Jet, Deputy Money, Deputy Lostaunau','1','2',1,0,2,1,1,'Uniform',1,1,2,2,2,2),(1313,'2014-12-15','Oklahoma','Oklahoma City','Oklahoma County Sheriffs Department',1,2,1,'Unconfirmed','An Oklahoma County Sheriff&#039;s Deputy is recovering after she was attacked Monday morning by a pit bull outside a NW Oklahoma City car repair shop.\r\nSheriff John Whetsel said 21-year-Oklahoma County Sheriff&#039;s Department veteran Susan Perkins was at Portillo&#039;s Auto Shop to serve a no-contact order to an employee.

The sheriff&#039;s dispatch received a call at 11:32 a.m. on Monday from a caller who said a pit bull was trying to attack him. The call was made by a 23-year-old meter reader working in the 1200 block of Hull Road. The meter reader had entered the gated backyard where two pit bulls were locked in a separate area of the yard that was also gated, according to Washtenaw County Sheriff&#039;s Office spokesman Derrick Jackson. The Humane Society of Huron Valley, who provided medical assistance to the dog, could not confirm the breed of the dog. While the man was attempting to read the meter, one of the dogs jumped the enclosure and attacked him, according to the sheriff&#039;s department. The caller was able to use his reading wand to keep the dog from biting him, but he became trapped within the yard. He called 911 while the dog was attacking him and as he continued to try to fend off the dog, deputies arrived on the scene. The dog charged and attacked the deputy, Jackson said. That deputy then shot the dog. Deb Kern, director of marketing and media relations for the Humane Society of Huron Valley, said the 50-pound female dog was shot in the back and was immediately transported to HSHV by her owners. &quot;The dog came in and they (surgeons) did work on the dog for almost five hours and she did pass away,&quot; Kern said. &quot;Unfortunately, she did not make it.&quot; Jackson said Friday that the department interviewed neighbors, who said the dogs have a prior history of being vicious. Details on the shooting were not listed on a media release from the sheriff&#039;s department earlier this week. DTE representative Len Singer said after checking all of the security logs, he saw no reports of any DTE workers being involved in the situation. &quot;I can&#039;t confirm that any of our employees were involved at all,&quot; he said.

The officer tried to retreat but was forced to shoot the dog in self-defense, Sylvia said. Officers temporarily detained seven people. One was captured several blocks away after he jumped over a fence. Galvan, 28, was arrested on suspicion of committing forgery and burglary, passing fake checks and identity theft. Two other men were arrested on warrants.

But Sperfeld still gets choked up as he recalls the fate of Shadow, who was shot three times by retired Trooper Anthony Randazzo at the Trenton Greenbelt trails shortly after 7 p.m. Aug. 24. Sperfeld, 67, of Utica, believes Shadow was intentionally killed by Randazzo in retaliation for a heated argument that Sperfeld said he had with a woman at the trails the night before. &ldquo;She said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got connections. I&rsquo;ll take care of your dog and I&rsquo;ll take care of you,&rsquo; then the next day my dog was dead,&rdquo; Sperfeld said.\r\nRandazzo has not been charged at this time, and state police officials said it could be some time before investigators and prosecutors with the Oneida County District Attorney&rsquo;s Office can determine what really happened.\r\n&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some disagreement over how close the dog was to the shooter, and that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re going to be sitting down with the DA to see if a law has been broken here,&rdquo; state police Troop D Capt.

Once Sperfeld let Shadow loose, he said Randazzo got out of his vehicle and was carrying a pistol in his hand, according to Sperfeld&rsquo;s police complaint.\r\nShadow then ran toward Randazzo, Sperfeld said, and the dog was about 30 feet away when Randazzo shot it once in the chest. After the dog fell, Randazzo then stood over the dog and fired several more times, Sperfeld said.\r\n&ldquo;My dog never bit anyone, and he went up to people and greeted them, then if he liked the people he&rsquo;d put his paws up and give a little lick,&rdquo; Sperfeld said. &ldquo;I was crying, &lsquo;Shadow! Shadow!&rsquo; and the man said, &lsquo;Step aside, I&rsquo;ll finish him off.&rsquo;&rdquo;\r\nRandazzo instead called a local veterinarian clinic and helped carry Shadow to Sperfeld&rsquo;s car.

A shotgun and pistol were fired about 1:30 p.m. Thursday as officers descended on the house in the 7200 block of Weyburn that was believed to be a location where drugs were sold. Authorities were confronted by an unrestrained pit bull as they tried to enter a chain-link fence surrounding the yard, Houston Police Department spokesman Kese Smith said. A man inside the fence and another in the open garage did not comply with commands to get on the ground. Neither man gave verbal directions to the dog. &quot;It happened very quickly. The officers announced themselves, opened the gate and the dog immediately charged ,&quot; Smith said. That&#039;s when officer J.C. Oliver first fired at the animal. &quot;In fear of his life and that of his partner, he discharged his HPD shotgun several times, striking the dog,&quot; Smith said. When the animal continued to advance, Oliver fired his duty pistol and killed it. &quot;At that point in time, they noticed that one of the suspects who&#039;d been in the garage had been slightly wounded or grazed from a ricochet of one of the shotgun pellets,&quot; Smith said. &quot;They immediately gave him first aid and he was taken to a local hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.&quot; Both men got on the ground after the dog was shot. During the course of the incident, officers discharged a flash-bang &mdash; a distraction device used when executing high-risk warrants. Relatives identified the wounded man as Clarence Branford Jr., 57, and said his 31-year-old nephew, Willie Washington, was the other person taken into custody. Washington and Branford each have been charged with possession of a controlled substance, according to the Houston Police Department. Wayne Branford, whose brother and nephew were apprehended, said he had no knowledge of drug activity at the home where his sister also lives. &quot;For them to shoot as they were serving a warrant for drugs? It don&#039;t take all that. If a dog is protecting their territory and people with ski masks jump out? I&#039;d bite too,&quot; he said. Relatives said the dog, named Kai, belonged to Washington. Police called the tan-and-white terrier &quot;a pit bull who they knew from intelligence to be very vicious and his job was to protect the property, intimidate customers and act as an early warning system to the people inside to let them know someone was here,&quot; Smith said. The spokesman also confirmed that the wounded suspect was a subject of the search warrant, but could not comment on whether drugs had been found in the home. The number of shots fired will be determined during the investigation. Narcotics officers will continue executing their search warrant after homicide investigators process the scene, Smith said. Oliver, who is assigned to the narcotics division, joined HPD in December 2002.

Shortly thereafter, police came back to his house, claimed the dog was a vicious pit bull, shot it three times, watched it push its way under a fence and then searched for it up and down the block, trying in vain to catch it, according to witnesses and the police report. The incident July 10 outraged Ryan and his neighbors in the 14500 block of Kolmar Avenue, who said the shooting wasn&rsquo;t justified. &ldquo;We think this is completely wrong,&rdquo; said Sarah Bielicki, one of Ryan&rsquo;s neighbors. &ldquo;They could have saved its life. Instead, they shot it on the spot.&rdquo; The officer who shot the dog wrote in his police report that he did so because it ran to attack him. The dog was behind the Ryans&rsquo; garage at the time. &ldquo;We heard &lsquo;boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,&rsquo; &rdquo; Ryan said. &ldquo;I saw the poor dog try to scratch at the front gate to get out, and it ran to the other end of the fence, and the next thing I saw it was running down the street. That was the last I&rsquo;ve seen of the dog.&rdquo; Police said they initially were called to the scene about 2:55 p.m. because a brown pit bull was running around the area. Police said officer Joseph Croak chased the dog to the yard and was waiting for the homeowners to return and a public works employee to arrive when he was called to a crime in progress. Ryan and his wife Nancy came home to find the note Croak had left. &ldquo;There was a note on the gate that said, &lsquo;There is a very large dog in your yard,&rsquo; &rdquo; Ryan said. &ldquo;I thought it was a joke or something.&rdquo; Because of a shift change, it was Midlothian officer William Miller who went into the yard with Midlothian public works employee Joe Powers, who tried to use a noose to catch the stray dog. Public works employees are assigned to handle stray animals because the village has no animal control unit, Midlothian Police Chief David Burke said. Captured dogs are taken to the Animal Welfare League at 10305 Southwest Highway, Chicago Ridge. This one wasn&rsquo;t captured, however. When Powers tried to noose the dog, its &ldquo;hair went up&rdquo; and it began growling at the two men, police said. Miller followed it behind the Ryans&rsquo; garage, where the dog started barking at the police officer and ran up to attack him, police said. Miller pulled out his gun and shot the dog once in the head and twice in the ribs, police said. The wounded dog then sprinted past Miller and pushed its way under the fence before disappearing, police said. Police searched the neighborhood to no avail. &ldquo;A vicious dog in that condition could have gone after an officer or anyone,&rdquo; Burke said, adding that Miller is the handler of the department&rsquo;s police dog.

The police report listed the dog as a pit bull, but the owner&#039;s roommate, Natalie Macias, said he&#039;s a 75-pound American Bulldog named Whitey. The neighbor complained that Whitey attacked his own dog, which was chained in his yard, as well as other people in the neighborhood. Police said they spoke with other neighbors who told them the dog had chased them. The officer who responded was able to reach the dog&#039;s owner by phone. The owner said he was on his way home from Charlotte. While officers waited at the home with animal control, Whitey charged the fence and later escaped through a hole. The dog then charged the police officer, who &quot;defended himself from the advancing [dog] by discharging his firearm at the [dog],&quot; which died as a result of his injuries, according to the report. Macias believes the use of deadly force was unnecessary, and said the neighbors&#039; accounts of the dog&#039;s viciousness were exaggerated. &quot;They could&#039;ve subdued the dog with a tranquilizer. Shooting and killing him is just outrageous,&quot; said Macias. &quot;Whitey was great with kids and never hurt anyone. Too many dogs are killed for no reason these days and it&#039;s just sad.&quot; Macias also said Whitey&#039;s heightened aggression Tuesday evening could been attributed to a female dog being in heat. The dog&#039;s owner was issued a ticket by animal control for alleged violation of the county leash law.

A Pearl police officer shoots and kills a family&#039;s pet pit bull after a gate is accidentally left ajar. Pet owners on both sides of this story are up in arms. The dogs got loose Monday. While they were out, other animals were harmed by the pit bulls. The young owners say their dogs are not vicious, that they have owned their pets since they were 6 weeks old. But the pit bulls killed two cats while on the loose. Outraged neighbors called police. They arrived before animal control got on the scene and killed the male dog. According to Misty Glenn, they used a shotgun not a pistol. &quot;According to the gentleman that cremated him, it had no head left,&quot; her husband, John Glenn said. &quot;I feel horrible he killed the cat and everything. He&#039;s never been vicious toward any human being or nothing like that. Pearl police stand by the officers actions, saying the male dog named &#039;John McCain&#039; went into attack mode when he was cornered.\r\nLt. Butch Townsend said, &quot;That was cat #2 with his intestines out. Like I said these could be children just as easily as if they were cats. We responded to these dogs before and assisted them in putting theses dogs up.&quot; Now Misty says, &quot;All we are trying to ask is that for one, it be recognized it could have been handled differently.&quot; The distraught pet owners spent $2,000 dollars on a special pen to make sure their animals were in compliance with the vicious dog ordinance and their homeowners insurance. The fence is surrounded by a hot wire. While the dog owners acknowledge responsibility and maintain is was a tragic accident, their beloved female pit bull Chloe may never get to come back home. Chloe has been banished from the city of Pearl by animal control. &quot;I just want to keep my little girl. She&#039;s like a baby like he was.&quot; The Glenns hope officials will reconsider the decision.

Friday. St. Clair County Commission Chairman Stan Batemon confirmed Monday two dogs were shot and killed at the shelter Friday. &ldquo;I know (St. Clair County Animal Control Officer) Josh (Wyatt) was called out to the shelter Friday,&rdquo; Batemon said. &ldquo;(St. Clair County Property Manager) Harold Hoyle said there were two dogs at the shelter acting aggressively toward shelter staff.&rdquo; Batemon said Hoyle is currently investigating the matter and could not confirm who shot the dogs. Animal Shelter of Pell City Inc. Board President Helen Powell said to her knowledge, Friday was the first time two dogs had to be shot and killed on shelter property. Powell said acting shelter manager Pat Martin informed her of the incident. Martin was not available for comment Monday. &ldquo;I spoke with Pat, and she doesn&rsquo;t want to comment on it,&rdquo; Powell said Monday. Powell said Martin informed her that when a shelter employee arrived Friday morning, two aggressive loose dogs were in the shelter yard, not in surrender pens. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know which shelter employee determined the dogs were aggressive,&rdquo; she said. Powell said the employee contacted Wyatt to assist with the dogs. &ldquo;They called Josh because he has a tranquilizer gun, and (Pell City Animal Control Officer) Rose (Ogden) doesn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said. Powell said Wyatt had to take care of a few matters before he could respond, so the shelter employee called Central Dispatch and the Pell City Police Department and Pell City Animal Control responded. Ogden said she was the first officer to arrive at the shelter, at about 8:20 a.m. Friday. &ldquo;I observed two large white dogs lying on the grass,&rdquo; she said. Ogden said two shelter employees and a shelter volunteer were standing outside the main shelter gate, which was closed. &ldquo;I asked what happened, and was told the dogs had approached a shelter employee,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I assessed the situation, to see how the dogs were behaving. They were calm, no hackles up, no growling, not displaying any aggressive behavior. They appeared to be relaxed.&rdquo; Ogden said Pell City Cpl. Jon Herren arrived to assist Ogden in trying to capture and/or contain the dogs. &ldquo;At no time was there any consideration of shooting the dogs,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There was no reason to&Ntilde;the dogs were not exhibiting any behavior to justify deadly force.&rdquo; Ogden said Pell City Police Sgt. Don Newton arrived and helped maintain safety outside the fence while Ogden and Herren attempted to capture or confine the dogs. &ldquo;We spent about 30-40 minutes, but were unable to capture them,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The area was so large, it was hard to contain them. There were too many places where the dogs could run around us.&rdquo; Ogden said Pell City Lt. Danny Holmes arrived at about 9 a.m. and determined the problem was not a police matter. &ldquo;The dogs were confined in the area, so Lt. Holmes said it was a matter for the shelter employees to handle,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He informed shelter manager Pat Martin the issue did not warrant police presence.&rdquo; Ogden said the two dogs did bark, but never displayed unusual aggression or tried to attack. &ldquo;They barked as a typical dog would in a strange environment,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They did not approach us aggressively and there was no indication they were going to bite.&rdquo; Powell said according to notes provided to her by Martin, after the officers left, Wyatt was called and arrived at the shelter around 9:30 a.m. &ldquo;Pat called the Pell City Animal Hospital to ask for a vet to euthanize the dogs,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The decision had been made that the dogs were too aggressive to be adoptable and would have to be put down.&rdquo; Dr. Ken McMillan, a veterinarian at Pell City Animal Hospital, said he went to the shelter to administer the euthanasia solution to the dogs. &ldquo;I was told the dogs had to be put down because they were too aggressive,&rdquo; he said. McMillan said when he arrived, he assisted Wyatt in attempting to catch one of the dogs that was running loose, and never saw the second dog. &ldquo;They were large dogs, thoroughly mixed breeds, probably 80-90 pounds,&rdquo; he said. McMillan said after Wyatt shot the second dog, he was able to get close enough and administer the euthanasia solution. &ldquo;There was no choice but to shoot the dog,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t get close to the dog.&rdquo; McMillan said tranquilizing the dogs was likely not a good solution, because tranquilizer guns are notoriously ineffective and there are too many variables. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a horrible situation,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The person who dropped off the dogs may have thought they were doing the right thing, but we don&rsquo;t know for certain.&rdquo;','https://web.archive.org/web/20110715161721/http://www.dailyhome.com/view/full_story/14673999/article-St--Clair-County-investigating-dogs-being-shot-at-Animal-Shelter?','Unknown','Animal Control Officer Josh Wyatt - shooter, Animal Control Officer Rose Ogden, Pell City Police Cpl.

Community policing officers were sent at 11:07 a.m. to 126 Schiller Ave. to investigate a recurring complaint by a neighbor of loud music, Sgt. Tom Connellan said. Connellan gave these details: Officers arrived and heard the music. The first went to the upstairs apartment, where no one was home. As they were upstairs, the music became louder. The officers went back down and knocked on the first-floor apartment door. The officers then heard a dog growling and barking on the other side of the door. The officers identified themselves through the closed door and yelled for residents to control the dog. The door then opened and the dog charged out. The first officer fired a Taser device at the dog, but one of the two prongs missed and the dog got back up in the small enclosed porch. With one officer backed into a corner, the second officer fired his handgun, fatally shooting the dog. Elizabeth Coy, who lives at the house, said Lucky, the pit bull, was good dog. The family disagrees with the police version of events. Jessica Coy, Elizabeth Coy&rsquo;s granddaughter, said her boyfriend answered the door and attempted to get the dog under control but the officer at the door prevented the door from closing, allowing the dog to escape. She said the officer pushed the door open. She said the officers did not identify themselves or order the dog be put under control before the door opened. Connellan said the dog has been picked up by animal control officers previously and was unlicensed. Jessica Coy said the dog was picked up as a stray, but that he wasn&rsquo;t a vicious dog. She said the dog is licensed but the actual license was misplaced in a move. She said the dog was lying on the ground twitching because of the Taser when the dog was shot. Family members did say police pulled a Taser probe from the wall of the porch after the incident. &ldquo;The officer had no right to shoot that dog and I am suing the police department,&rdquo; Jessia Coy said.

The officers were on a narrow trail when the 75-pound, male Rottweiler mix came at them, Clark said. The lead officer was hampered by two large trees on either side of him, he said. &quot;He essentially had no other option and nowhere to retreat,&quot; he said. &quot;Officers had seen the dog&#039;s owner and pleaded with the owner to pull the dog off, and the dog continued coming at the officer in a very aggressive way, literally running and lunging at the officer.&quot; The camper and dog owner, 47-year-old Paul Boulerice, was arrested on suspicion of violating his parole and possessing a dangerous weapon, Clark said. The weapon found at his campsite was a billy club fashioned from a bike handle with custom lead weights on it, he said. Officer Ron Inouye, a five-year veteran who Clark said loves dog and has experience training them, shot the dog. &quot;It really is an unfortunate set of circumstances,&quot; he said. &quot;He was convinced that was his only option.&quot; Boulerice is on parole for making threats to an officer and for trying to take an officer&#039;s gun during a fight, Clark said. He has a history of drug-related arrests. His family once owned The Impossible Restaurant on Soquel Avenue, he said. &quot;Mr. Boulerice had an opportunity to call his dog off and could have tied him up in the area,&quot; he said. The area is off Brookwood Drive on the inland side of Highway 1 and snakes up around the south side of DeLaveaga Park, and slopes down to a creek that is the city limit, Clark said. Less than lethal options such as pepper spray or a Taser or a baton have a limited effect to immediately stop dogs, Clark said. Todd Stosuy, who manages the animal control portion of the Santa Cruz County Animal Shelter said officer-involved shootings of dogs have occurred &quot;every once in a while&quot; since he started in the county eight years ago. County shelter workers went out to retrieve the dog&#039;s body, Stosuy said. &quot;If there is an officer-involved shooting, they do their own internal investigation to see if the level of force was justified,&quot; he said. &quot;We hold onto the animal for them and transport it to the vet if a necropsy is necessary.&quot; To prevent such encounters, he said anyone approached by law enforcement should make sure their dog is on a leash. And if an owner knows the dog has a propensity to attack or bite, it should be muzzled, Stosuy said. &quot;Those really are the keys,&quot; he said. &quot;Definitely if you are someone on probation or parole, and you are dealing with law enforcement, you should make sure your animal is properly contained.

She said she found a lady standing in the driveway talking to someone when she asked her if she had seen a brown and white dog come by. &quot;She said she had seen the dog but that he wasn&#039;t there, so I asked her which way he went, and that&#039;s when she said wait a minute and got her husband,&quot; Linda said. According to Linda Ritchie, Eden Police Officer Jamie Buffkin came outside in his police uniform and asked her if she had a pit bull. She said she told him no, and he asked what he was. &quot;I told the officer, &#039;He is an American bulldog pit bull mix, not a pit bull,&quot; Linda Ritchie continued. &quot;That&#039;s when the officer said, &#039;I thought he was a pit bull -- I shot your dog.&#039; I just immediately fell apart.&quot; When asked why he shot the dog, Linda said Officer Buffkin told her Neko lunged at him. &quot;This is the most gentle dog in the world and he has never lunged at anyone; he has never been in a dog fight -- he&#039;s a house pet,&quot; Linda said. &quot;He told me if I got my husband, he would let us come back and get the dog. He also said, &#039;I didn&#039;t shoot the black one.&#039;&quot; Linda said went over and got Bobby Ritchie and told him what happened. Bobby Ritchie said he didn&#039;t realize how many times Neko had been shot until he picked him up to bring him home. &quot;After I laid the dog in our driveway, I went back over and asked the officer how many times he shot the dog. He said four times because the dog kept lunging at him. There&#039;s no way the dog could keep lunging at him (after being) shot that many times. So I lost it. I got real upset and said some things to the officer I probably shouldn&#039;t have, because he asked me to leave his property.&quot; A citation was written to the Ritchies for a city ordinance violation of a dog running loose. According to the incident report filed with the Eden Police Department, Buffkin said the dog charged at him while he was on the back porch. Buffkin said two dogs, one black and one brown and white, had cornered his dog on his back porch. According to the report, he said he tried to move the dogs on, but when he walked out the door, the dogs started barking at him. Buffkin said the brown and white dog then charged at him. The report states Buffkin fired four shots from his .40-caliber Glock off-duty weapon. It also states the dog then turned and went out into the yard and laid down. There are no mentions of bites, cuts or bruises inflicted by the animal in the incident report. The Ritchies said there are many discrepancies in the police report and the story they were told by Officer Buffkin the night of the incident. &quot;If the dog wandered off his deck and went down and flopped down in the yard after being shot four times, I would assume his head would be pointing away from the deck,&quot; Bobby said. &quot;The dog was laying in the yard with his head pointing toward the deck. He also didn&#039;t mention anything about him thinking the dog was a pit bull in the police report.&quot; Linda Ritchie said she may have seen a different perspective if the officer had offered any type of apology. &quot;He has yet to apologize to any of us,&quot; she said. &quot;If he had been a little more remorseful, I might feel a little differently. But it was just like &#039;He&#039;s a pit bull. I shot him. Take it or leave it. It&#039;s my yard.&#039;&quot; Linda Ritchie said they have contacted the officer&#039;s superiors at the Eden Police Department, Eden&#039;s city manager and two councilmen. She said they are also considering hiring an attorney, but will wait to see if the city will offer a thorough investigation into the events. According to the City of Eden Code of Ordinances, a vicious dog is defined as: &quot;Any dog that has made one or more unprovoked attacks on a human by biting or causing abrasions or cuts of the skin, or any dog who makes repeated attacks on farm stock or pet animals.&quot; An at-large dog is defined in the Code of Ordinances as off the property of its owner and not under restraint. Linda Ritchie formally addressed city council members at Tuesday&#039;s meeting about the incident. City Attorney Erin Gilley advised against any council members or city employees speaking about the situation. She said the police department is currently conducting an investigation and the results are pending.','https://web.archive.org/web/20110526225730/http://www.thetimesnews.com/news/dog-44302-linda-officer.html','Neko','Jamie Buffkin','0','0',2,0,0,0,1,'Uniform',1,3,2,2,2,2),(1352,'2011-04-27','North Carolina','Asheville','Asheville-Buncombe Tech Campus Police and Security Department, Buncombe County Animal Shelter',1,2,1,'Unconfirmed','A pit bull was taken from the AB Tech Campus by animal control Tuesday.

Monday, police released a report that refers to the incident as an &quot;animal problem.&quot; Officer Byron Daniels and Officer Andre Bills were patrolling the McClinton Nunn Homes in the 300 block of Dennis Court near Nebraska Avenue and Weiler Avenue in the central city about 9:50 p.m. They were looking for people involved in an earlier gunfire incident when they saw a female &quot;pit bull&quot;-type dog &quot;acting very aggressive,&quot; the officers wrote in their report. The dog charged the officers and forced them into a nearby residence. They then contacted the Lucas County Dog Warden&#039;s Office, requesting help. Once a deputy dog warden arrived, the dog attacked Officer Daniels, who was standing outside. The police report said many public housing residents were behind him, at which time the dog &quot;was shot and killed,&quot; according to the report. Pellets from the shotgun used in the shooting ricocheted into two adjacent residences in the 500 block of Hyatt Lane, &quot;causing damage to the exterior and interior of both residences and also damaging a light in the upstairs east bedroom&quot; in one of them, officers stated in their report. The Hyatt address where the bedroom light was shot is the same as the one Ms. Galloway gave The Blade as her home address. Besides Ms. Galloway and her children, those at the residence at the time of the shooting included Ms. Galloway&#039;s 14-year-old sister, a family friend, and the friend&#039;s 19-year-old daughter. They all were in different parts of the unit, none of them in the bedroom, Ms. Galloway said.

They didn&#039;t hear about what happened to the dog until Jan. 7, when they found out Roxi had been shot and killed by a Richland Township Police Officer after the dog was found getting into a chicken coop on Jan. 6. While in the coop, Roxi killed four chickens and injured two more, before animal control and Richland Police Officer Kim Aldrich showed up. He said the animal control officer and Adrich talked about the dog&rsquo;s weight and the fact it wouldn&rsquo;t allow them to approach it before deciding to shoot it. &ldquo;The problem is that the dog didn&#039;t have a collar, was skinny, looked like it was starving and killed some chickens, then it took off when the (chicken) owner came home,&rdquo; said Richland Police Chief Robert Dalton. He said the decision to shoot the dog happened after a discussion between animal control and the officer about the dog&#039;s weight and the fact that when they approached the dog, it would run from them and lay down in a nearby field. &ldquo;It just laid out near the field,&rdquo; Dalton said. &ldquo;Rather then worrying about the dog doing more damage it was dispatched.&rdquo; Roxi had been taken from a shelter about two months before the shooting. Haremski said the dog looked skinny, but had always been skinny since they had gotten her and they fed her both canned and dry dog food. Roxi weighed about 50 to 60 pounds when she was shot, Haremski said. Haremski said she thinks the incident was handled incorrectly and wonders why the police shot the dog but wouldn&#039;t try to use a tranquilizer. The decision to not use a tranquilizer gun was made by animal control, said Dalton. He said the animal control officer felt they couldn&rsquo;t get close enough to the dog to use it and because it was lacking a collar and looked thin, they decided to kill it. Dalton said he feels the officer handled the issue correctly and said he wouldn&#039;t change the way the events unfolded. It&#039;s done and over with &hellip;,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If the dog would&rsquo;ve been taken care of properly, it wouldn&#039;t taken off in the first place.&rdquo; Dalton said another issue was the dog wasn&#039;t licensed. He also said typically the Richland Township Police Department receive calls from individuals who have lost their dogs, so if officers do find a stray they can have an idea of who owns it. Haremski said the dog wasn&#039;t licensed but they were in the process of getting the dog, which they had owned for two months after picking her up from an animal shelter, licensed but were a month behind. She and her boyfriend are considering moving after the loss, she said. &ldquo;We hear stories about stray dogs all the time and very rarely do you hear about one getting shot, a husky at that,&rdquo; she said.','http://www.mlive.com/news/saginaw/index.ssf/2011/02/from_the_comments_should_a_dog.html','Roxi','Kim Aldrich, unknown animal control employee','1','0',2,0,0,0,2,'Uniform',2,3,2,2,2,0),(1357,'2011-04-28','Indiana','Terre Haute','Terre Haute Police Department',1,30,0,'Labrador and Chow mix, 4yo','A north-side Terre Haute resident said he intends to file a complaint with city police after an officer shot and killed his dog Thursday evening.

Terre Haute Police Chief John Plasse said the department received a complaint that a dog had gotten loose and was chasing people around 16th and Plum streets. A person at the scene reported the dog had attempted to bite him, Plasse said. Police went to the home of the dog owner and, at that time, &ldquo;the dog came at our officer in an aggressive manner and he felt threatened and shot the dog in order to protect himself,&rdquo; Plasse said. Terre Haute police are entitled to protect themselves or others if they believe a dog is going to injure someone, Plasse said. The dog, which was a Labrador and Chow mix, was friendly and often played with children that came in the yard where it was sometimes chained up, Knezevich said, adding that the dog weighed about 35-to-40 pounds and broke his chain Thursday evening. &ldquo;She did break loose,&rdquo; Knezevich said. &ldquo;She broke her chain.&rdquo; Knezevich said he owns two other dogs and often chains them in his yard when the weather is nice. The incident Thursday evening took place while Knezevich said he was away from home. He was informed of what happened by the custodian of Deming Elementary School, which is near his home, he said. Because a firearm was discharged during the incident, police will investigate to see whether or not it was justified, Plasse said. If Knezevich files a complaint, police will investigate his allegations as well, he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s unfortunate that the dog was out and was shot,&rdquo; Plasse said. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t like that to happen, but we don&rsquo;t want our officers or someone else getting bitten by a dog either.&rdquo;','https://web.archive.org/web/20110823115913/http://tribstar.com/news/x277105958/Terre-Haute-police-shoot-kill-dog','Unknown','Unknown','1','0',1,0,0,2,2,'Uniform',3,3,2,2,2,2),(1358,'2011-02-12','North Carolina','Kernersville','Kernersville Police Department, Forsyth County Animal Control',2,2,0,'Mixed Breed','A Kernersville police officer was forced to shoot and kill a sheppard mix dog Saturday afternoon.

The officer had head injuries and a broken finger and the dog was shot twice by another officer, according to police and the dog&#039;s owner. It all started around 8 p.m. on Friday when Officer Eric Bruce tried to pull over a car that ran a stop sign near Northwest Sixth Avenue and Foster Road in Hallandale Beach, according to the police report. Police say that after a brief pursuit, the suspect &ndash; Jarvis Barnes, 29 &ndash; jumped out of a Toyota Avalon and wrestled with Officer Bruce during a foot chase. That&#039;s when the officer was injured. According to the police report, Barnes ran off and a SWAT team surrounded a house on the 500 block of Foster Road where the suspect was later arrested. Barnes was charged with aggravated battery on a law enforcement officer. Police also found cannabis in the car Barnes was driving. He had a suspended license and was on probation, according to the report. During the incident, Delvin Foster was feeding his 5-year-old, 80 pound dog Adam in the backyard of his girlfriend&#039;s home on the 500 block of Northwest Sixth Street when he heard the commotion out front. According to Foster, the dog &quot;trotted&quot; toward the noise and he called the dog back. &quot;Soon as I said &#039;Adam, get over here,&#039; I heard a couple of shots; three or four shots,&quot; he said. Foster said he ran around the corner and was confronted by two officers. &quot;The cops put guns in my face telling me to get down, so I complied,&quot; Foster said. The dog had been shot in the shoulder and the back. Foster claims one of the two officers admitted to shooting his dog, saying &quot;he was in fear for his life.&quot; &quot;My dog was retreating back to me and that&#039;s why he was shot in his back,&quot; he said. &quot;I really don&#039;t understand.&quot; Girlfriend Catherine Runyon says the two police officers allowed her to put the wounded dog back in his cage but would not let her take the dog to a veterinarian for medical attention. &quot;They said they had to wait for people to come and take pictures of the dog and it was almost two hours before they did finally come,&quot; Runyon said. &quot;And, the dog is just sitting there bleeding to death.&quot; A friend eventually took the dog to the Hollywood Animal Hospital where vets were waiting for a $1,000 down payment before beginning any surgery, Foster said.

Robinson said Spanky was gentle and never snappy, but the dog Robinson describes is a far cry from the dog a Eugene Police Department detective encountered on Tuesday. According to neighbors and Robinson, the detective stopped by Robinson&#039;s home to talk to him about an unrelated case involving one of his neighbors. Robinson said he wasn&#039;t home at the time but that the detective later told him that as he approached Robinson&#039;s home, he noticed that the door was open and that Spanky was in the yard. According to neighbors, the detective said Spanky began to growl and show his teeth before lunging towards him. That&#039;s when neighbor Jim Clarke said he heard two loud gunshots. &quot;The dog started charging him, so he fired. It was like boom boom,&quot; said Clarke. &quot;We immediately looked out the window to see a dog run by, and it collapsed right there.&quot; Robinson said he came home after a neighbor called to tell him that an officer had just shot his dog. Robinson said aggressive behavior is completely out of character for Spanky. &quot;I believe it was excessive use of force because he shot him twice,&quot; said Robinson. &quot;The only reason I can think he would do something like that is if the officer already has his gun drawn.&quot; Robinson said a neighbor watched as the detective approached the home. According to that neighbor, the detective approached the house with his gun drawn, Robinson said. Robinson said he believes the detective could have fired warning shots before shooting at the dog, or that he could have gone back to his car. Eugene police said they were not available to comment on the incident. According to the Eugene Police Operations Manual, officers are only allowed to shoot when intending to &quot;kill a dangerous or injured animal when other disposition is impractical.&quot; Clarke, the neighbor who heard the shooting, said the detective was forced to make a split second decision. &quot;You have a human and an animal.

Raynold Irvin Savela was arrested and charged with assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature and 3rd degree assault. According to a police report, officers responded to the Flowertwon Villages in response to a 911 call about a fight in progress. They found Savela&#039;s mother and her boyfriend standing outside. When the officers approached the house, a black pit bull approached one of the officers. The officers told Ms. Savela to control the dog but the dog lunged at one officer, snapping and growling at him. He was bit in the arm, the report states. The dog then approached the other officer who warned Ms. Savela to restrain the dog. She did not, so the officer fired three shots, striking the dog twice. Then, Savela ran from the house demanding to know who had killed his dog. He pointed to his mother&#039;s boyfriend and said, &quot;My dog is dead because of you.&quot; According to the report, Savela then aggressively approached the officers who told him to stand down or risk being tased. Savela did not heed the warnings of the officers and was tased, the report stated. After Savela was detained, officers learned the fight started between Savela and his mother&#039;s boyfriend because the two men do not get along. The fight started inside the Froman Drive home when the two men bumped into each other and neither would back down. Sheriff L.C. Knight says they have policies in place to protect their officers but the incident was unfortunate. &quot;We&#039;re real sorry we had to shoot the dog.  However these dogs are vicious and people who like these dogs I wish they&#039;d keep them pinned up,&quot; said Knight. According to police documents, Savela posted bond and was released Sunday.','http://www.wafb.com/Global/story.asp?S=13625988','Unknown','Two unknown police','2','0',2,0,0,1,1,'Uniform',3,2,2,2,2,0),(1367,'2010-11-11','North Carolina','Fayetteville','Fayetteville Police Department',1,50,0,'Rottweiler puppy less than 1 year old','A Fayetteville police officer shot and killed a Rottweiler on Thursday morning after a woman said it trapped her in her car and then reportedly charged the officer who was trying to help her, according to police. The dog, a family pet named Cochief, was not quite 1 year old and had to be removed from the front yard by the family after being struck twice by gunfire, said owner Cheryl Hillsman, 21. &quot;That&#039;s messed up,&quot; Hillsman said. &quot;He was nice, playful. Never charged nobody, never bit nobody. He let people pet him, everything. They had no reason to shoot him.&quot; Hillsman said the family had let Cochief out into their fenced back yard Thursday morning, but he evidently escaped the fence confines by digging under it. The next thing the family knew, Hillsman said, the dog was dead in the yard on the side of the house. Police responded to the 200 block of Murray Fork Drive in the Devonwood neighborhood about 8:30 a.m. after a neighbor, Erica Doyle, reported that she was trapped inside her car by a Rottweiler in her yard, said Lt. Chris Davis, a police spokesman. Doyle declined comment Thursday. Davis said that Officer Jason Beldon arrived to help her and, using his vehicle, lured the dog away from Doyle&#039;s vehicle. &quot;At some point, the dog went back into its yard and the officer thought the dog was no longer a threat,&quot; Davis said. Beldon had returned to talk with Doyle, who was out of her car, when the dog reappeared and charged at them, according to Davis. Beldon tried to distract the dog to stop the charging but was unable to and instead shot it, he said. The officer was following the dog when it again charged him, prompting the officer to fire again, killing the dog, Davis said. The dog&#039;s owner was notified and came to the scene. Davis said he didn&#039;t know whether police or Animal Services had been called to the area to deal with complaints about the dog running loose before. &quot;If the dog&#039;s just running around, there&#039;s not a whole lot we can do about it,&quot; Davis said. &quot;If the dog is considered a threat, we&#039;ll do what we can until Animal Control gets there to just subdue the dog - put it in the yard, tie it up, do whatever. But in this case, we really didn&#039;t have that opportunity.&quot; Hillsman acknowledged Cochief had gotten lost before, but she said he wasn&#039;t a threat. &quot;He got loose one time and he was playing with the neighbor,&quot; Hillsman said. &quot;She said he was very playful. He was playing with the other dogs and her. She petted him a couple times the first time he went over there.&quot; Another neighbor, Harriet Coleman, 69, said the dog was contained most of the time and wasn&#039;t a problem. Now and again, she said, he would slip out and run around the yard, but he would usually go right back. Dogs that walk past the home, Coleman said, don&#039;t have any trouble either. &quot;Some people are just scared of dogs,&quot; Coleman said. &quot;Listen, when you&#039;re sitting there &#039;till the dog moves, you know, blow the horn or something. You put more fear in him. I know that&#039;s what I would have did. When I see a dog, I don&#039;t run.&quot; Hillsman said she understood how people could have been afraid of Cochief, because of his size, but that he was a good dog. The officer should have used a Taser or pepper spray before drawing a firearm against the dog, she said. Davis said that departmental policy allows officers to shoot an animal that is a threat to themselves or others. The incident will be reviewed to determine whether Beldon acted properly, Davis said.','https://web.archive.org/web/20101114005247/http://www.fayobserver.com/articles/2010/11/11/1047192?sac=Local','Cochief','Jason Beldon','2','0',2,0,0,0,2,'Uniform',0,3,2,2,2,2),(1371,'2014-12-26','Maryland','Glen Burnie','FBI Baltimore Field Office, FBI Inspection Division, Anne Arundel County Police Department ',1,100,0,'Great Dane','The following is reproduced from an article in the Baltimore Sun based on uncorroborated FBI statements.

The dog was shot and killed by an Omaha police officer nearly four years ago. His owner, Colleen M. Carroll, on Monday filed a lawsuit in federal court accusing the city and two police officers of violating her Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable search and seizure as a property and pet owner. The lawsuit seeks at least $250,000 in damages. &quot;It&#039;s been tough on her,&quot; said Carroll&#039;s attorney, Bob Broom of Omaha, who said Lucky Boy was a peaceful family pet. According to court records, Officers Constance Garro and Mike Ashbrook, along with at least two unnamed officers, executed a no-knock search warrant at the Carroll home, 6568 Military Ave., on Nov. 18, 2004. Carroll and Lucky Boy were in the living room at the time. The lawsuit says officers, standing outside the home, had not announced their presence when one of them fired a shot that entered the house through a storm door and struck Lucky Boy. He died soon thereafter. The search warrant was for stolen property believed to be connected to Carroll&#039;s adult son, Broom said, and had nothing to do with her. Broom said Lucky Boy posed no threat to officers and should not have been killed. In a police report filed the day Lucky Boy was shot, &quot;a sergeant said the dog was dangerous. We have no idea where that information came from,&quot; Broom said. Ashbrook retired last year, police said. Garro is still on the force. Lt. Darci Tierney, a spokeswoman for the Police Department, said police officers have no choice but to shoot dogs that appear dangerous and a threat to public safety. Tierney said police recruits have started receiving training on how to deal with dangerous dogs and dogs in general. Paul Landow, chief of staff to Mayor Mike Fahey, said Omaha police have shot 39 dogs since 2007. Of those, 32 were pit bulls and one was a pit bull mix. Fahey is sending City Council several measures in response to a series of pit bull attacks in recent months. The proposals would place restrictions on pit bulls, but not ban them. &quot;In the line of duty, Omaha police officers encounter a large number of dangerous dogs,&quot; Landow said. &quot;Sometimes it is necessary to shoot those animals.&quot; LAWSUIT INFORMATION: Carroll v.

It&#039;s not allowable,&quot; said Horton. Police first reported the dog killed was a pit bull. The family says Spot was a Bluetick Heeler/ Terrier mix that was lovable and friendly. Police also say an officer can shoot an animal if they feel that animal is going to hurt someone. Friday, the officer was treated for a minor cut on his hand. Police also say they will investigate this case further. Police arrested Edward Horton in connection with the case. He was booked for disorderly conduct, and several dog violations. The family says Edwin was just trying to save his dog by doing CPR. He wanted to take it to the vet. Sunday, the family showed us the dog&#039;s license and vaccination papers.','https://web.archive.org/web/20150101140342/http://www.fox42kptm.com/Global/story.asp?S=8855093','Spot','Unknown','2','0',2,2,2,1,1,'Uniform',2,2,2,2,2,0),(1390,'2008-06-19','Nebraska','Omaha','City of Omaha Police Department, Nebraska Humane Society',1,2,1,'Boxer mix, 2yo','An Omaha man has a lot of questions for police. He had to put his dog to sleep after it was shot by an officer. The incident began on Thursday morning. An officer was issuing a parking ticket when he spotted a car with expired plates. He entered the gate outside Richard Freeman&#039;s house and Freeman&#039;s two dogs, a pit bull and a pit bull-boxer mix, named Chewy, ran up to him. What happened next depends on who you ask. Freeman says, &quot;He was just hyper, friendly, loved everybody.&quot; He says his two-year-old dog Chewy was just being playful when an Omaha police officer shot him. The officer had been writing a parking ticket on the street and noticed a car in Richard&#039;s carport with expired plates from Iowa. OPD Officer Michael Pecha says, &quot;As the officer went, went into the yard to investigate that storage vehicle, two pit bulls went out of the house and charged that officer.&quot; Police say the officer fired one shot, hitting chewy but Richard&#039;s friend, Jeff Mueller, tells a different story. Mueller says, &quot;I come out here and the gate had been unlatched. And there&#039;s, uh, an officer with a gun drawn on the dog.&quot; Jeff says he pleaded with the officer not to shoot. &quot;As soon as I said &#039;don&#039;t shoot, he&#039;s not mean,&#039; the officer shot him not once but twice.&quot; Richard says Chewy had to be put down Thursday night. Police issued him a citation for the Jeep and the Humane Society issued some as well. Freeman says, &quot;They issued me the tickets for no restraint when my dogs were behind the fence.&quot; Jeff Mueller says, &quot;This whole yard is fenced in with a chain link fence. I don&#039;t understand it. There was no excuse for the shooting at all.&quot; Richard says he doesn&#039;t understand why the officer didn&#039;t use mace instead of bullets. Officer Pecha says, &quot;They do have the right to defend themselves against these dangerous animals.&quot; Freeman still contends that Chewy was no danger and says at this point he just wants one thing. &quot;Just that they recognize this and it was an extreme wrong. Maybe they&#039;ll take different precautions so nobody else loses any, you know, no more dogs.&quot; Richard Freeman also received tickets for not having his dogs&#039; rabies vaccinations up to date. They were also not licensed. He admits he&#039;s at fault for that but he says he&#039;ll fight the tickets for lack of restraint on his dogs. He is also filing a complaint against the officer involved in the shooting.','http://www.wowt.com/home/headlines/20619744.html','Chewy','Unknown','0','0',0,0,0,0,1,'Uniform',0,2,2,2,2,0),(1391,'2007-04-29','Ohio','Garfield Heights','Garfield Heights Police Department',1,2,0,'Unconfirmed','From the Cleveland Plain Dealer: A Garfield Heights police officer shot a chained-up watchdog that lunged at him as he chased a group of kids through backyards, a police spokesman said.

Stephanie Howard said her husky, Layla, was shot near 82nd and Potter streets, just outside Omaha&#039;s city limits. The Douglas County Sheriff&#039;s Department investigated the shooting and deputies said that Layla was a vicious dog, and in their view, the man who shot her didn&#039;t do any thing wrong. Howard said her son, Eddie, heard three gunshots and went out to look for the dog and found Layla laying in the yard. &quot;I was just devastated,&quot; Howard said. &quot;I was really hysterical, and said, &#039;Why did you shoot my dog?&#039;&quot; She said that her neighbor told her Layla had threatened his wife and children in the car.  &quot;He said to me, &#039;I immediately got my gun, and when I came out of the door, she ran at me and I shot her,&#039;&quot; Stephanie Howard said. Howard said her neighbor told her that Layla didn&#039;t bark or growl. &quot;My neighbor is an Omaha police officer, which also says is that the first reaction of a police officer to get your gun,&quot; she said. Douglas County sheriff&#039;s deputies found in an investigation that Layla was a vicious dog. Chief Deputy Marty Bilek said that a dog doesn&#039;t have to bark or growl to look vicious.  &quot;He was threatened and he had the option to shoot,&quot; Bilek said. Howard said her dog loved people and loved to play. There is an Omaha Police Department policy for officers firing their weapons that says: &quot;Discharge of firearms or other force where death or serious injury occur need to be reported.&quot; It is not clear whether the policy applies when an animal dies. An Omaha police spokeswoman said she could not say whether there is an investigation under way into the dog&#039;s death. Howard said that she called the Omaha Police Department and was told she&#039;d get to make her case to internal affairs. She said that somebody called her back to say the case would now be an internal investigation and she wouldn&#039;t know the results.','https://web.archive.org/web/20150101145718/http://www.pitbulltalk.com/viewtopic.php?t=16879&amp;p=173740','Layla','Unknown','2','0',1,0,0,0,2,'Plain Clothes',2,2,2,0,2,0),(1393,'2007-06-01','Nebraska','Omaha','Douglas County Sheriff',1,2,1,'Unconfirmed','The following is reproduced from filing number 19 from US District Court of Nebraska United States of America V. MAURICE L. COLEMAN SR., criminal case number 8:07CR211, section 1. &quot;Facts&quot;: At the hearing, Douglas County Deputy Sheriff Thomas Flynn testified that he was called to assist in serving a protective order and warrants on the defendant at 3809 Miami on June 1, 2007. While the officers were attempting to serve the warrants, they were charged by a pit bull. The officers shot at the dog and then tracked the dog. They were told that the dog had menaced the neighborhood for several weeks and had attacked a mail carrier. After locating and retrieving the dog, the officers returned to the house. A vehicle entered the driveway and a man, later identified as the defendant&rsquo;s father, exited the car. Shortly thereafter, the garage door opened and the defendant came out, waving a white shirt over his head. The officers approached the defendant with weapons drawn, ordered him to the ground, and handcuffed and searched him. The defendant complained of back pain and had scratches on top of his head. Defendant stated that he had been in a car accident, but did not provide any details Deputy Flynn contacted the Omaha Police Department and learned that Coleman was a suspect in a felony hit-and-run accident that had occurred three or four days earlier. Coleman was then transported to Creighton University Medical Center. Deputy Flynn testified that defendant stated he was not on medication nor had he consumed any narcotics.

It was shortly after noon on July 23 and several men dressed in black jeans and green shirts were getting out of an unmarked white Suburban, casually putting on flak jackets and helmets. Soon the men were lingering in front of his neighbor&#039;s house in the upscale gated subdivision of quarter-million-dollar homes. Delfino never would have guessed that he was witnessing the final preparations by the Maricopa County Sheriff&#039;s Office SWAT team moments before it unleashed a barrage of tear gas grenades into his neighbor&#039;s home. &quot;They looked unprofessional. They were getting dressed on the scene. They weren&#039;t organized,&quot; Delfino, 22, says. From his vantage point inside his home, Delfino couldn&#039;t see that deputies had rolled an armored personnel carrier into the neighbor&#039;s front yard as they prepared to storm the house. Delfino could see no readily visible insignia on any of the men, so he figured the scene must be a prelude to a prank on the two men and a woman with a toddler who lived in the two-story stucco house across the street. &quot;I thought, these must be their friends and they are going to try and shoot paint balls at them,&quot; Delfino says. But soon he knew that what he first thought was a gag must be about something deadly serious. &quot;I saw one of the guys was perched and aiming a gun at the window,&quot; he says. &quot;All of a sudden, he fires off a tear gas round into the upstairs window. &quot;I immediately called 911. I didn&#039;t know what was going on.&quot; Delfino says the men -- who he next thought must be members of a gang -- continued firing tear gas canisters through three upstairs windows in the front of the house. He saw others wearing flak jackets go around to the back of the house, where he heard them fire two more rounds at the upstairs windows of a back bedroom. After a few minutes on the phone with a 911 operator, Delfino says, he was told that the Maricopa County Sheriff&#039;s Office was serving a search warrant on the house and &quot;not to worry.&quot; That&#039;s when Delfino really got nervous. With good reason. Delfino tells me he didn&#039;t know whether a huge gun battle was about to erupt 20 yards from his front door. No one from the sheriff&#039;s office had alerted him -- or any of his neighbors -- to evacuate. Moments later, the situation deteriorated even further when the house erupted into flames. Now, the entire neighborhood of closely packed homes was threatened by the possibility of fire. There wasn&#039;t a fire truck in sight. Delfino&#039;s &#039;hood wouldn&#039;t have fared much worse if it had been a gang of street thugs blasting away at the house, rather than Sheriff Joe Arpaio&#039;s inept and bumbling SWAT team. In less than 30 minutes, Arpaio&#039;s special forces unleashed an unprecedented wave of violence on this quiet community. Consider this: Just after the tear gas canisters were shot, a fire erupted and destroyed a $250,000 home plus all the contents inside. (The home&#039;s occupants believe the tear gas canisters caused the fire. Phoenix fire officials say the blaze was probably started by a lighted candle that was knocked onto a bed during the confusion.) The armored personnel carrier careened down the street and smashed into a parked car after its brakes failed. And in the ultimate display of cruelty, a SWAT team member drove a dog trying to flee the home back into the inferno, where it met an agonizing death. Deputies then reportedly laughed as the dog&#039;s owners came unglued as it perished in the blaze. &quot;I was crying hysterically,&quot; Andrea Barker, one of the dog&#039;s owners, tells me. &quot;I was so upset. They [deputies] were laughing at me.&quot; Making fun of the 10-month-old pit bull puppy&#039;s death wasn&#039;t enough. Arpaio&#039;s goons then left the dog&#039;s body to rot in the ashes for the next five days of 105-degree temperatures. A pall of death hung over the neighborhood. It was a putrid reminder of Arpaio&#039;s reckless use of force and callous disregard for the public&#039;s welfare. Not to mention the heinous treatment toward the terrified dog. And what did Arpaio&#039;s crack SWAT team net from the raid that left a needless trail of death and destruction? MCSO stormed the house believing there was a cache of stolen automatic weapons and armor-piercing ammunition. But MCSO got bushwhacked. Instead of finding weapons of mass destruction, they discovered an antique shotgun and a 9 mm pistol that appear to be legal weapons. There was no sign of the cop-killer bullets. Perhaps they are buried somewhere out in the desert, with Saddam&#039;s plutonium. Given the overwhelming display of force deployed by Arpaio&#039;s deputies, one would have expected the arrest of a mass murderer. Instead, the crack SWAT boys nabbed 26-year-old Eric Kush. Let me tell you, Kush is really a bad, bad guy. He was wanted on a misdemeanor warrant for failing to appear in Tempe Municipal Court on a couple of traffic citations. Thank God he&#039;s off the street. Well, not quite. He posted his $1,000 bond on the misdemeanor warrant and was quickly released from jail. Arpaio&#039;s Ahwatukee assault should have drawn banner headlines in the daily newspapers. But the Arizona Republic, where Arpaio&#039;s son-in-law, Phil Boas, serves as deputy editor of the editorial pages, buried the story in a community section. The East Valley Tribune ignored it entirely. The local papers missed a helluva story. Needless to say, neighbors are infuriated. &quot;The operation was completely and grossly mishandled,&quot; says Justin Delfino&#039;s father, Gene. &quot;They endangered my son and other people in this neighborhood,&quot; Gene adds. &quot;I would love to see their reaction if this happened in their neighborhood.&quot; I&#039;m not criticizing the sheriff&#039;s department for investigating activities at the Ahwatukee home occupied by Gabrial Golden, Andrea Barker and Eric Kush. There are clear indications that these young people living in an upscale rental home might have been engaged in some serious criminal activity. My gripe is that Arpaio&#039;s SWAT team embarked on extreme and dangerous maneuvers that unnecessarily placed the entire neighborhood in mortal danger. A more measured, thoughtful and patient response likely would have achieved the same goal without the wholesale destruction of private property and the death of a puppy. Gabrial Golden, 28, has a history of felony arrests dating back to 1996. He is on probation for an armed-robbery conviction. In July, he became the focus of a Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department investigation in connection with the theft of automatic weapons and armor-piercing bullets. Early on the morning of July 23, hours before MCSO rolled into Ahwatukee, Gabrial Golden was lured to a meeting with his probation officer, where he was arrested. He remains in custody. According to press accounts, upon his arrest, Golden told MCSO that Kush was acting erratically and was armed. Kush, however, had no felony record, and his only legal ding was failing to appear in Tempe Municipal Court on a traffic warrant.\r\n\r\nThere were no other indications that Kush was about to unleash a rampage of cop-killer bullets on the neighborhood. In fact, Barker says she didn&#039;t even know Kush was at home when the SWAT team suddenly appeared in the front yard, complete with an armored personnel carrier. The 22-year-old Barker says MCSO banged on her front door, announced they had a warrant and kicked in the door before she could respond. &quot;I was coming down the stairs and I heard them pound on the door,&quot; Barker says. &quot;Literally two seconds later they kicked the door in mine and my daughter&#039;s face as I was trying to open it.&quot; Barker says deputies yanked her and her daughter outside. &quot;They started yelling, `This is the sheriff&#039;s department! Eric, come out with your hands up!&#039;&quot; Barker says. But Eric didn&#039;t come out. Initially, he holed up in the attic. &quot;I guess he just got scared,&quot; Barker says. With Kush crouched in the attic, the SWAT team could have entered the house and made their way upstairs to confront him. Instead, they started launching tear gas grenades. &quot;Three to five minutes after they shot the tear gas cans into my bedroom, I saw flames coming out the back of the arcadia door,&quot; Barker says. Within minutes, the upstairs of the house was engulfed in flames. Kush, Barker says, could hear Dre, his prized pit-bull puppy, yelping, and he jumped from the attic to try to save the dog. As black smoke billowed from the house, Barker says, Kush frantically tried to get Dre to run outside, the puppy yelping &quot;like a baby.&quot; At one point, Dre ran from the master bedroom and bolted down the stairs toward the front door, where it came face to face with a SWAT team member. Instead of letting the dog run outside, the SWAT member reportedly launched a counterattack. &quot;They shot the dog in the face with a fire extinguisher when he tried to come out of the fire,&quot; says Trisha Golden, Gabrial&#039;s younger sister, who helped raise the dog and was outside the burning home calling for it to come out. She did not live at the house, but hung out there frequently, she says. She heard about the fire and came immediately. &quot;He turned and ran back into the master bedroom and burned [to death].&quot; Delfino says he asked one of the SWAT officers what happened to Dre and was told that the dog had been &quot;neutralized&quot; with the fire extinguisher. He asked the officer if the dog had attacked anybody, and the cop said no. As smoke filled the house and Kush&#039;s efforts to save the dog failed, he finally fled from the burning home and was immediately thrown to the ground and his hands and feet were cuffed by four SWAT officers. Meanwhile, Trisha Golden continued frantically to call for Dre to flee the house. &quot;We were like screaming for Dre, and [a deputy] turned around and said, `Why don&#039;t you shut the fuck up?!&#039;&quot; Trisha Golden says. I couldn&#039;t reach Eric Kush or Gabrial Golden for comment. But Kush, a biking and skateboarding enthusiast, told KTVK-TV Channel 3 that sheriff&#039;s deputies thought it was hilarious that his dog had burned to death in the fire. &quot;As they&#039;re hog-tying me, they have the nerve and the audacity to laugh at me and say, `Did you hear that dog screaming upstairs?&#039;&quot; Kush told Channel 3. &quot;I don&#039;t know how they have the audacity and the heart to say something like that.&quot; Eric Kush is not an intimidating fellow. He&#039;s about five-feet-six-inches tall and weighs about 125 pounds. There was no indication he had taken anybody hostage or was endangering the neighborhood. In fact, neighbors say he is a friendly and easygoing guy. His only legal blemish was the outstanding misdemeanor warrant. If MCSO truly believed they were facing a madman armed to the teeth with armor-piercing bullets that would cut through the flimsy chicken-wire and stucco walls of homes in the neighborhood, they didn&#039;t have the sense to alert neighbors to get the hell out of Dodge. Instead, they left the entire area at risk of getting mowed down by a spray of bullets fired from automatic assault rifles that easily could travel a mile. But who cares about innocent neighbors when Arpaio&#039;s morons take to the street to make a pinch? Who cares that there was a far easier and safer way to nab Kush for questioning? The most prudent, cautious and least costly way to pick up Kush would have involved only a handful of officers. That wouldn&#039;t have been anywhere near as much fun as whipping out the big assault rifles and putting on all that manly body armor. And MCSO wouldn&#039;t get to deploy Arpaio&#039;s beloved armored personnel carrier if they opted for the low-key approach to community policing. Lucky the damn tank didn&#039;t run over some kids playing in the street! Arpaio unleashed his SWAT team on Ahwatukee without bothering to give Phoenix police, which has primary jurisdiction in the community, a heads-up about his latest Joe Show. The sheriff&#039;s failure to alert Phoenix police about the planned SWAT assault will be the focus of a high-level meeting between the two police agencies. Phoenix City Councilman Greg Stanton says Phoenix police should have been notified before MCSO launched such a dangerous and ultimately unnecessary SWAT maneuver. Most police agencies would consider the afternoon&#039;s outing disastrous. But for Arpaio&#039;s idiots, it was a good day -- at least they made an arrest. No matter that they arrested Kush on a misdemeanor warrant and found none of the automatic weapons that were supposed to be stashed in the house. As fire spread throughout the house and engulfed the dog, the SWAT team soon had another crisis erupt. The armored personnel carrier was pulled back from the house as the fire raged. But a deputy apparently failed to set the brakes on the heavy vehicle and it began rolling down a hill and smashed into a parked car. The combat vehicle caused at least $4,000 damage to Julie Madrigal&#039;s car. The 44-year-old mother and her 9-year-old daughter had already been terrified by the tear gas assault as they fled from their car and ran into their house. At least Madrigal and her daughter weren&#039;t in the path of the carrier as it careened down the hill. &quot;I heard three shots as we were running in,&quot; Madrigal says. &quot;I thought, `Oh my God. They are shooting at us.&#039; I didn&#039;t know what was going on.&quot; Madrigal says she watched the house burst into flames and moments later was shocked to see the &quot;tank&quot; roll down the road toward her car. &quot;All of a sudden, I saw my car jump back three feet and the tank land on top of it,&quot; she says. The grand scale of the assault by Arpaio&#039;s Barney Fifes made neighbors wonder if Osama himself was holed up in the house. As details about the raid circulated through the community and word spread about the absence of any serious and immediate threat to the peace, neighbors became enraged over Arpaio&#039;s ludicrous use of force. &quot;We gathered all around all afternoon to talk,&quot; Madrigal says. &quot;We were all saying this was just ridiculous. They just went way overboard. This was just crazy. They should have given us some kind of warning.&quot; Finally, MCSO packed up its toys and went away. But the stench from their operation would continue to linger for almost a week. MCSO&#039;s callousness toward the dog, its owners and the neighborhood continued for another five days as the dog lay decomposing inside the burned-out house. Delfino says the stench permeated his car and left neighbors gagging when they went near the house. &quot;When I finally went in [to the house], it was enough to make you throw up,&quot; Delfino says. It never occurred to the MCSO that the rotting dog was a health hazard and a public nuisance. Once Arpaio&#039;s deputies finished their so-called investigation, they walked away from the mess they created, leaving Dre&#039;s body embedded in the rubble. It was only then that the occupants were allowed inside. Delfino says he was with Kush and Trisha Golden when, while digging through burned debris on the kitchen floor, they came across Dre&#039;s remains. Kush, Delfino recalls, fell to his knees and began vomiting. They could only stay in the room for a few moments, but long enough to gather some evidence of the animal cruelty inflicted by Arpaio&#039;s deputies. &quot;I took a picture of [Golden] with a shovel holding the dog&#039;s head,&quot; Delfino says. The Ahwatukee fiasco is just the latest in a long string of bumblings and constitutional breaches by Arpaio and his nimrods. This comes on the heels of last November&#039;s botched prostitution raid where Arpaio&#039;s bozo posse men got naked and, in some cases, had sexual relations with hookers -- leaving Maricopa County Attorney Rick Romley little choice but to throw out the cases. Then there was the publicity-stunt televised arrest of two Peoria firefighters on arson charges during the middle of their night shift. The arrest sidelined a fire truck for the rest of the evening, putting lives needlessly at risk. Two months later, Arpaio&#039;s detectives haven&#039;t filed a police report with Romley&#039;s office, and no charges have been filed against the firefighters. And there was the Glen Campbell charade, where Arpaio insisted to the press that Campbell would be treated like any other inmate. Of course, he was put up in a clean, air-conditioned cell at a seldom-used holding facility in Mesa. Campbell brought along his favorite guitar, a cell phone and an orthopedic back mattress. Toward the end of his cushy 10-day jail sentence, Campbell stroked Joe with the now-infamous Tent City concert. While the incidents listed above are bad enough, they don&#039;t get at the more serious problems during Arpaio&#039;s 12-year reign. Inmates continue to be killed and maimed in Arpaio&#039;s county dungeons, ranked as among the worst in the world by Amnesty International. About 9,000 people are stuffed into the county&#039;s jails, which were built to hold a maximum of 5,000 inmates. Increasingly paranoid, Arpaio routinely uses his police powers to illegally investigate political opponents and silence any employee and, in some cases, any private citizen, who dares to criticize his office. At the same time, Arpaio refuses to comply with Arizona&#039;s public records law, flagrantly ignoring my requests for routine records concerning the financial operations of the jail. My demand for the financial documents relating to the jail commissary comes on the heels of my discovery that Arpaio has invested an inordinately large amount of cash ($800,000) in three commercial real estate ventures. His spokeswoman insists that nothing is amiss here, but Arpaio refuses to divulge the details of these transactions. Now, members of Sheriff Joe&#039;s SWAT team have laughed over the death of a dog and at its owners who were tearfully trying to coax their pet out of the burning house. Again, Sheriff Joe is hiding, refusing to return my repeated requests for an interview about why he let his goons do what they did to Dre. The really sick thing is that Arpaio has gotten huge publicity for his campaign against animal abuse. He&#039;s diverted scarce sheriff&#039;s office resources to duplicate services already provided by Maricopa County Animal Care and Control so that he can be seen as the ultimate animal protector. Arpaio likes to brag that he spends more money feeding dogs and cats than he does feeding inmates. This, you see, makes him a tough guy, something voters in the past have dearly loved. There&#039;s story after story in the press featuring Arpaio boasting how he puts abused pets inside air-conditioned cells while inmates and pre-trial detainees are dangerously packed into stifling overcrowded cells, dormitories and tents. The sheriff&#039;s office formed the Animal Cruelty Enforcement posse in the wake of the ritualistic slaying of several cats in the Ahwatukee area in 1998. As the cases of animal cruelty increased in number, Arpaio formed the Animal Cruelty Unit in January 2000. According to the MCSO Web site, &quot;This Unit responds to calls all over Maricopa County dealing with everything from complaints of no food and no water, to animals being starved, beaten, tortured, even killed by suspects.&quot; Hey, Joe, what do you think about your SWAT team chasing the dog back into a burning house? Maybe your vaunted Animal Cruelty Unit should investigate the SWAT guys for contributing to the needless death of this animal. Not only did your boys cause the house in which Kush was living to burn down with their assault, they stood by and watched in amusement as the dog&#039;s frantic cries gave way to eerie silence. &quot;I think it was a big joke to them,&quot; says Trisha Golden. &quot;They knew how bad we were freaking out about the dog.&quot; As usual, Arpaio is trying to blame his deputies&#039; latest fiasco on someone else. The scene hadn&#039;t even cooled down after the fire before the MCSO was trying to pin the blaze on Kush. &quot;They said I was upstairs in the attic burning all these missing guns,&quot; Kush told Channel 3. &quot;Why would I burn myself in my own house?&quot; Especially since the only guns found in the house were the shotgun and pistol, which appear at this point to be legal weapons. While Kush offers a plausible denial for starting the fire, a raging debate is quickly surfacing over what did cause the blaze. MCSO and the Phoenix Fire Department are vigorously trying to focus attention away from the tear gas canisters as the likely cause of the fire. Meanwhile, the occupants of the house are convinced that the fire was triggered by the tear gas attack. Phoenix fire officials tell me that four tear gas canisters were fired through upstairs windows in the front of the house, which matches eyewitness accounts by Barker and Delfino. A fifth canister, fire officials say, was reportedly fired into the attic of the house. Two other tear gas canisters were fired at the arcadia window in front of the master bedroom, the room where the fire originated. Phoenix Fire Department spokesman Bob Kahn says those canisters never entered the master bedroom. One reportedly bounced off a balcony rail and landed in the yard, and the second hit the arcadia window, but did not enter the bedroom. Despite the highly suspicious fact that the fire erupted minutes after the tear gas was fired into the house, the Phoenix Fire Department&#039;s preliminary report is blaming a lighted candle located near the bed in the master bedroom for sparking the blaze. &quot;The cause was probably the candle on top of the refrigerator knocked onto the bed by either the pit bull or the occupant,&quot; Kahn says. Kahn says fire investigators were told by MCSO Detective Mike Traverse that Kush reportedly stated that there was a &quot;lit aromatic candle located on the refrigerator next to the bed.&quot; Investigators, Kahn says, found a wax residue near the corner of the bed where the refrigerator was located. Barker isn&#039;t buying this explanation. She repeatedly told me during two interviews that there was not a lighted candle in the bedroom. She says the aromatic candle was located in the bathroom, but that it was not lighted. &quot;The only thing I had on my refrigerator next to my bed was an alarm clock and some pictures,&quot; she says. Barker says she knew the MCSO fired at least two tear gas canisters at her bedroom window based on information she derived from sitting in the SWAT command vehicle. She says she &quot;heard it break the window.&quot; &quot;Two or three minutes after they shot it into the room, we had a fire in the master bedroom,&quot; she says. Barker believes at least one canister landed on the down comforter on her bed and set it on fire. Last week, I entered the burned-up house through an open front door. It was clear the fire started in the master bedroom, and there was a huge hole in the floor beneath the bed. It appeared that Dre fell through the floor and landed in the kitchen, where the dog was covered by charred debris. There were other holes in the floor where a canister could have possibly ignited a fire, burned through the floor and fallen into the kitchen below. As far as I&#039;m concerned, it doesn&#039;t matter whether a candle or a tear gas canister started the fire that burned the house and killed the dog. There would have been no fire if Arpaio&#039;s overzealous and unsophisticated SWAT deputies hadn&#039;t needlessly launched a dangerous assault in a densely populated area. Such operations should be reserved for the most dangerous situations, where innocent lives are at stake. In this case, there was one guy with a misdemeanor warrant holed up in the house. He hadn&#039;t fired a single shot. He wasn&#039;t threatening anybody. There were no hostages. There was no clear indication that the house was full of heavy automatic weapons. All Arpaio&#039;s deputies had to do was show a little patience and a modicum of common sense. But these are traits that neither Arpaio nor his deputies seem to possess. Instead, an entire neighborhood was subjected to a dangerous assault that left children traumatized, residents furious, and a puppy on fire. &quot;It was totally uncalled for,&quot; says Gene Delfino. &quot;You don&#039;t go hunting for deer with a tank.&quot;','https://web.archive.org/web/20070527015945/http://phoenixnewtimes.com/2004-08-05/news/dog-day-afternoon/full','Dre','Joe Arpaio, unknown SWAT team','1','0',1,0,2,1,1,'Uniform',1,0,0,0,2,0),(1395,'2002-09-03','New York','New York','NYPD',1,50,0,'German Shepherd','From New York Daily News: The city has agreed to pay $90,000 to a Brooklyn woman and her 15-year-old twin sons who were traumatized by cops who raided their Flatbush apartment with a no-knock warrant looking for drugs. During the 30 minutes inside the apartment, cops allegedly held the boys and their mother at gunpoint, damaged their personal effects and stomped on the head of the family&#039;s German shepherd dog, according to the complaint filed in Brooklyn Federal Court. Darnell Myers and his brother, Edward, were in bed when cops &quot;blew open&quot; the front door of the apartment at 55 Parade Place on Sept. 3, 2002, tossing a flash grenade inside. Their mother, Williemae Mack, was partially clothed when cops entered her bedroom with guns drawn. &quot;She got down on the floor on her stomach and one police officer stood on her back,&quot; according to the complaint. The complaint also alleged that the teenage brothers were handcuffed at gunpoint while the cops searched the apartment. &quot;An unidentified police officer stomped the dog, injuring its head,&quot; according to the complaint. The brothers suffered nightmares &quot;of guns pointed at them,&quot; the suit stated, and were receiving counseling at Kings County Hospital. &quot;We believe the settlement was fair in that it provides Ms. Mack and her two sons with compensatory damages for the violation of their civil rights in that the police executed an erroneous no-knock search warrant,&quot; said lawyer Norman Siegel. The city Law Department said in a statement it believed the &quot;entry into the plaintiffs&#039; apartment was proper pursuant to a valid search warrant. &quot;However,&quot; the statement said, &quot;in the interest of avoiding further litigation costs, the city felt that settlement was appropriate. From the New York Times (https://web.archive.org/web/20140824222347/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/11/nyregion/two-suits-filed-over-police-no-knock-raids-at-wrong-homes.html) : The second suit filed yesterday said a grenade was used as the police &#039;&#039;blew open&#039;&#039; the door of an East Flatbush woman, Williemae Mack, at 6 a.m. on Sept. 3, 2002. She and her twin 13-year-old sons were asleep, and guns were pointed at both boys and they were handcuffed by shouting officers, the suit said. The suits said no contraband was found in either raid and suggested that the raids were based on incorrect information from narcotics informants and poor supervision of the officers. Police officials said this summer that the use of concussion grenades had been sharply curtailed. But the lawyer who filed both suits yesterday, Norman Siegel, said that in recent years the department has increasingly relied on the no-knock warrants that permit the surprise entries. He said police data showed that officers search more than 460 addresses every month in the city, and that the vast majority of those searches were conducted under warrants that permitted the no-knock entries. The city&#039;s Law Department declined to comment, saying that its lawyers had not reviewed the suit. The Police Department did not respond to a request for comment. Last October, months before the Harlem raid in which Ms. Spruill died, the Police Department&#039;s chief of patrol, Nicholas Estavillo, sent out a memorandum outlining search warrant procedures. The memorandum directed that supervising officers &#039;&#039;must conduct observations&#039;&#039; of the address in question before permitting such raids. He added that any observations that appeared to conflict with information from confidential informants &#039;&#039;should be a &#039;red flag&#039; that additional investigative steps must be taken.&#039;&#039; Christopher Dunn, the associate legal director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said yesterday that &#039;&#039;there is every reason to believe that memo has not been enforced.&#039;&#039; He said the lawsuits filed yesterday could establish rules limiting the police&#039;s use of the no-knock warrants. Yesterday, Robert Rogers, the Springfield Gardens man whose house was raided, said that it would have been easy for officers to have learned who lived at his address and that there was no sign of narcotics. Instead, he said, they burst through the door, shouting. &#039;&#039;That was the most frightening experience of my life,&#039;&#039; he said. &#039;&#039;I don&#039;t think anybody should have to go through it.&#039;&#039;','https://web.archive.org/web/20150101161042/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/boroughs/city-oks-90g-deal-raid-trauma-article-1.612724','Unknown','Unknown','2','2',1,0,1,0,2,'Uniform',0,0,2,2,1,2),(1397,'2007-03-02','New Jersey','Paterson','Paterson Police Department Emergency Response Team, Paterson Animal Control, Passaic County Prosecutors Office Major Crimes Unit, Passaic County Sheriffs Department',1,50,1,'Pit Bull, 18 months','From &quot;Paterson cop winged by colleague firing on a pit bull&quot;, New Jersey Herald News, March 3 2007 By SUZANNE TRAVERS and NAVID IQBAL original URL: http://www.northjersey.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjczN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXkzNTcmZmdiZWw3Zjd2cWVlRUV5eTcwODY1ODcmeXJpcnk3ZjcxN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXkz - An officer on the city&#039;s SWAT-style Emergency Response Team shot a fellow officer during a drug raid on a home on North Bridge Street Friday afternoon. The officer was on the second floor of the house trying to shoot a pit bull when a bullet went through the floor and struck the arm of another officer, said Passaic County Prosecutor James Avigliano. Officer Robert Klein, 30, a member of the Paterson ERT squad who joined the department in 2001, was taken to St. Joseph&#039;s Regional Medical Center. A hospital spokeswoman said Friday night that Klein had been admitted and was in stable condition. Police did not release the name of the officer who shot Klein. Paterson police spokesman Lt. Anthony Traina would not say whether anyone was arrested in the raid or if any drugs were seized. Avigliano said he could not confirm what type of gun shot Klein. The raid occurred at 32 N. Bridge St., a small, powder-blue single-family house in a First Ward neighborhood where drug trafficking is often visible. In October, a Pompton Lakes man was shot and killed on adjacent East Holsman Street. Jason Lugo, 22, said he lives in the raided house with his mother and brother, and occasionally, his mother&#039;s boyfriend. Lugo, who said he was a criminal justice student at Passaic County Community College in Paterson, said he returned home Friday and learned that his home had been raided and his dog killed. Lugo said his pet was an 18-month-old black pit bull named &quot;Runt-Runt&quot; which he&#039;s had since it was a puppy. &quot;I don&#039;t know where this came from,&quot; he said, sitting on an East Holsman Street stoop while about 25 officers milled outside his home.  Lugo said he was told by someone at the scene that his dog had been shot five or six times, but police wouldn&#039;t confirm that. He speculated that police had come for his mother&#039;s boyfriend and a friend of the boyfriend. &quot;I don&#039;t think there was a need for them to shoot my dog,&quot; he continued. &quot;I can&#039;t even talk right now. I swear I&#039;m starting to hate God.&quot; Paterson Animal Control Chief John DeCando said he was not present at the raid but was told that an animal control officer tried to capture the dog with a dog stick, a metal rod with a looped wire at its end. The dog apparently lunged at the animal control officer, leaving a Paterson ERT officer &quot;no choice but to shoot&quot; the dog, DeCando said. The Prosecutor&#039;s Office Major Crimes Unit&#039;s shooting team, which responds to any police investigation involving gunfire, was deployed to the scene after the officer was struck, Avigliano said. &quot;It was a use-of-deadly-force incident,&quot; Avigliano said. &quot;Any time a gun is discharged, we have to be notified, even where one of those pit bulls is shot.&quot; The Passaic County Sheriff&#039;s Department&#039;s Crime Scene Investigation unit also responded. The Paterson Police Department created the Emergency Response Team last June. The squad&#039;s officers patrol 22 hours a day on regular police shifts but are specially trained to execute drug raids, for which they wear black fatigues, helmets and body armor. From June 15 through December 2006, the team executed some 10 to 12 narcotics search warrants a month, according to Sgt. Peter Hasselberger. According to statistics supplied by the department&#039;s Narcotics Bureau, in 2006, Paterson police entered 162 city homes and apartments with narcotics warrants. Last July, the ERT squad shot and killed a pit bull during a drug raid on a house on Oak Street, alarming residents who worried that a ricocheting bullet could have hit two small children who were just feet away in the apartment. NOT MENTIONED IN ARTICLE: The cop who was shot, Robert Klein, would be involved in at least one future incident at Oradell Animal Hospital ( http://patersontimes.com/2014/09/26/three-workers-compensation-claims-paid-out-by-city-totaling-58000/ ), where a dog bit his arm on November 1, 2012.

Police Detective Peter Yuskaitis was walking up the driveway of 165 Heights Ave. to speak with Rolando around 10:40 a.m. on July 13, according to police, when a large dog jumped over a 4.5-foot high fence and attacked him by biting his left forearm. Rolando is the owner of Cesar, a 55-pound, 7-month-old pit bull-Shar Pei mix. Rolando is a logistics specialist for the New Jersey State Task Force Search and Rescue. He owns four other dogs besides Cesar and prominently features &quot;Beware of Dog&quot; and &quot;Keep Out&quot; signs on his home. Rolando stated that Cesar was not a search and rescue dog but a &quot;personal dog.&quot; Rolando said Yuskaitis, whom he has known for the past 25 years, was &quot;canvassing the area&quot; after a robbery occurred on Lincoln Avenue in Hawthorne, about a mile and a half away, earlier in the day. Police said Yuskaitis drew his service weapon, a .40 caliber Sig-Sauer handgun, when the dog attacked and fired two shots. Rolando said Yuskaitis&rsquo; first shot shattered the dog&rsquo;s right, front leg. Yuskaitis was then knocked to the ground and hit his head. His gun discharged a second shot into the second floor of Rolando&rsquo;s house. The bullet proceeded through the outer wall into the upstairs living room and into the ceiling. Rolando&rsquo;s son, Brian, lives on the second floor. Brian said two friends were in the living room watching television at the time of the shooting. No other injuries were reported. Police were alerted to the incident by a 911 call from a Heights Avenue resident and, several seconds later, by a report from Yuskaitis to the Fair Lawn Communications Center. Police officers from Fair Lawn, Hawthorne and the Bergen County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office responded to the scene. Fair Lawn Police Chief Erik Rose and Capt. Joseph Cook were also present at the scene. Yuskaitis sustained puncture wounds on his left forearm from the dog bite. He was transported to St. Joseph&rsquo;s Hospital in Paterson. Rolando said Cesar was up-to-date with his vaccinations. Rolando said his dog was transported to Oradell Animal Hospital for surgery. He said the veterinarian&rsquo;s office estimated the cost of surgery between $5,000 and $6,000. Borough Manager Tim Stafford said at the July 13 council meeting that Yuskaitis had left the hospital and was recovering. Councilwoman Jeanne Baratta said the dog&rsquo;s leg was amputated as a result of the gunshot. Stafford indicated earlier in the day that he was unsure if the borough would pay for the dog&rsquo;s surgery. &quot;I don&rsquo;t know at this point,&quot; Stafford said.','https://web.archive.org/web/20150101165841/http://www.northjersey.com/news/detective-fires-two-shots-after-dog-bites-his-arm-1.296297','Cesar','Detective Peter Yuskaitis','0','1',1,1,0,0,2,'Not Sure',2,1,2,2,2,2),(1399,'2006-06-01','New Jersey','Paterson','Paterson Police Department Emergency Response Team',1,2,1,'Unconfirmed, 1yo','From New Jersey News Herald, &quot;Drug raids, related trauma, on rise&quot;, March 11, 2007, By SUZANNE TRAVERS - [...] At 17, Lisa LeBron is a veteran of several drug raids. When Paterson police came to her Oak Street apartment in summer 2006 looking for heroin, they found 50 glassine bags and arrested her boyfriend. On that visit, police told LeBron to move the family dog Yayo, a year-old pit bull, from room to room as they searched. But when police, including members of the newly formed Emergency Response Team, returned two weeks later to search the same apartment, they bashed through the wooden door and shot Yayo. In the bedrooms, they dumped clothing from dresser drawers, poured out pill bottles, unscrewed switch covers on power outlets, and swept knick-knacks off the shelves. In the kitchen, officers ripped out drop-ceiling tiles, spilled a bag of rice into the sink, pulled dishes from cabinets and let them break on the floor. This time, they did not find drugs. Police said they used more aggressive tactics on their second visit because the apartment&#039;s occupants did not open the door after the officers, wearing helmets and protective gear, knocked, announced their presence, and told residents to leash the dog. LeBron said the police burst in without warning. According to police, the dog tried to attack them. They later charged the father of LeBron&#039;s boyfriend with using the dog as a &quot;booby trap&quot; to delay police and give those inside time to flush drugs down the toilet. LeBron said the dog had not attacked but poked his head through a hole made by the police battering ram. When he was shot, Yayo -- a street term for cocaine -- dropped to the floor and urinated, soaking the carpet. LeBron says police dragged the dog downstairs. Officers said the dog continued to charge at them, but concur with LeBron that police shot the dog several more times in the building&#039;s foyer. Especially troubling to LeBron and others present was the fact that her boyfriend&#039;s 1-year-old niece stood behind Yayo when the dog was shot. LeBron held the child&#039;s 2-year-old brother some 5 feet away, she said. &quot;They shot the dog while the baby&#039;s right behind him,&quot; said LeBron. &quot;He was a friendly dog. He doesn&#039;t bite. He was just doing what a normal dog does &ndash; he was looking to see who&#039;s coming at the door.&quot; LeBron was so upset that within an hour, she had gone to City Hall to complain to Mayor Jose &quot;Joey&quot; Torres. In tears, she also called the Herald News, but did not file a complaint against police. Paterson police spokesman Lt. Anthony Traina declined to discuss further details of the incident, but said, &quot;If there are children present and the officer feels as a last resort that there&#039;s no other choice but to fire his weapon, that&#039;s the case.&quot; Prause, of the Prosecutor&#039;s Office, said SWAT officers &quot;have the utmost concern for children.&quot; &quot;We don&#039;t want to do anything that traumatizes them. They&#039;re innocent victims. There might just be one person in the house dealing drugs,&quot; he said. Such raids have cost landlords thousands of dollars in apartment repairs. Landlord Angel Rodrgiuez, 33, says the three doors smashed by the police battering ram at LeBron&#039;s Oak Street apartment cost him $1,700, not counting the paint and new flooring he needed to cover bloodstains in the stairwell. &quot;I saw it. I was like &#039;My God, this is unbelievable.&#039; The kitchen ceiling was on the floor. I don&#039;t know if I&#039;m angry at the police or the people that lived there,&quot; he said. There is no compensation for such damages except in cases of police wrongdoing, such as a raid on the wrong address. Rodriguez said officers at the scene told him his tenants were responsible for the damage and that he should take the repair money out of their security deposit. &quot;When they come to your apartment, they don&#039;t care about nothing,&quot; he said of the police. &quot;They just break. I guess that&#039;s what they&#039;ve been trained to do. I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s right or wrong.

Now they&#039;re talking about the whole ordeal. Charles and Tommy Jones said they did what they could to avoid being attacked by a Pit bull, and also to save another dog&#039;s life. City Councilman Charles Jones and his son Tommy say they were looking at property in the area Wednesday when they saw a Pit bull attacking another dog. &quot;That little dog was very defenseless and could not protect itself,&quot; said Jones. Charles Jones says a man was walking his dog down the street when the two Pit bulls came around. They say only one was in the fight here at Willingham and Carter Road. &quot;He didn&#039;t bark but he had his teeth showing and he was in attack mode,&quot; said Jones. To separate the two dogs, Tommy Jones stepped in to help with a tool from his truck. &quot;And [I] come down just as hard as I could, just like that, [with] the bland of this stick across his back two or three times, and it did not phase him one bit. He didn&#039;t even look up,&quot; said Jones. He said eventually someone was able to control the Pit bull. &quot;The man that owns the Pekingese took the chain from the Pit bull and wrapped it around the stop sign,&quot; said Jones. That stopped him long enough to pull his dog away.&quot; Jones said the Pit bull was so strong, that it was able to get away. &quot;When [the dog] broke loose from the stop sign, that&#039;s when he came after my father,&quot; said Jones. &quot;And my father jumped in the truck just in time, avoiding being bitten by the dog.&quot; Charles and Tommy Jones left and called Sylvester Police and Animal Control. They said the Pitt bull was shot and killed by a Sylvester Police officer at the scene, because it was aggressive and charged at the officer. Councilman Jones said Sylvester has a dangerous dog ordinance that he wants to tighten. &quot;I&#039;m going to recommend the council look at it, and see if has enough teeth in it to protect our citizens,&quot; said Jones. Animal Control said they are trying to locate who the dogs belong to. They also said the Pit bull was listed as a stray dog because it had no form of identification.','https://web.archive.org/web/20141129101718/http://www.walb.com/story/26749176/police-kill-pit-bull-after-dog-fight','Unknown','City Councilman Charles Jones and Unknown police','1','0',2,0,0,2,2,'Uniform',3,3,2,0,0,0),(1401,'2014-01-31','New Jersey','Paterson','Passaic County Sheriffs Office, Paterson Animal Control',2,2,1,'Unconfirmed','A detective was forced to shoot a dog that attacked investigators during a raid of a fortified Paterson drug den Friday, authorities said. When Passaic County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office narcotics detectives entered the Park Place apartment, a person inside released one of two dogs on the officers, Sheriff Richard H. Berdnik said. A detective fired a single shot to stop the attack. Inside, investigators discovered more than 1.5 ounces of crack-cocaine, marijuana, heroin, about $1,400 and a loaded Taurus 357 magnum handgun stolen from North Carolina, Berdnik said. Six people arrested in the apartment tried to flush the drugs down the toilet as cops moved in. The drug den was outfitted with video surveillance cameras watching the entrances along with layers of heavy-duty deadbolts and locks at the doors, according to the sheriff. &ldquo;I want to commend the detectives involved in taking down this illegal drug operation,&rdquo; Berdnik said in a statement. &ldquo;The reality is simple, anytime illegal guns are part of the equation, violence is a distinct possibility.&quot; The wounded dog was treated at the scene and taken to a veterinarian by Paterson animal control officers, according to the sheriff. The animal&rsquo;s condition was not immediately available Saturday. Arrested at the scene were Paige Appel, 23, of Paterson, and Nicole Kenyon, 18, of Hewitt, both charged with loitering to commit a drug offense and possession drug paraphernalia, authorities said. Appel was wanted on warrants issued in Fair Lawn and West Milford, and held at the county jail. Kenyon was released on her own recognizance. Four Paterson men &mdash; Tarrell Whitaker, 28, Keshawn Kennedy, 28, Rasheen McClam, 29, and Frank Weathers, 53 &mdash; were charged with a slew of drug offenses, including possession with intent to distribute crack-cocaine, possession with intent to distribute to heroin, possession with intent to distribute marijuana, all within 1000 feet of a school and unlawful possession of a handgun.

Alger&#039;s brother, Pete Garcia, is visiting at the time, to do some construction on the home. Alger is suspected of drug activity, Pete Garcia isn&#039;t. Pete Garcia awakes on the morning of the 26th to the sound of gunfire. He looks out his window, and sees that men dressed in camouflage have shot and killed his two dogs. There are no &quot;police&quot; markings on the men&#039;s uniforms. Alarmed, Pete Garcia runs downstairs, and exits the rear of the house. A man dressed in dark clothing, who still hasn&#039;t identified himself as a police officer, orders Garcia to the ground. Garcia is then kicked, and bound with a rope. The police officer then picks Garcia up and carries him back into the home, from room to room, face-out, with a gun to his head. A federal judge would later write, &quot;The officer was using Pete Garcia, in essence, as a shield against any gunfire that might come through one of the windows.&quot; It is only after Garcia is thrown down on the home&#039;s front lawn that he notices the faint outline of a sheriff&#039;s patch on one of the officers&#039; sleeves, and realizes he is being raided by police. Later, an officer inside the house would mistake his own reflection for an armed occupant of the home, and open fire. His fire would cause other officers to fire. Another officer then entered the home and fired an automatic weapon. The firing of that weapon caused Alger Garcia to discharge his own weapon, releasing a single shotgun blast that hit one raiding officer in the shoulder and neck. A federal court would later find that officers blatantly lied about the details of the raid, both in the raid report and in subsequent testimony. Remarkably, Pete Garcia -- who was never suspected of a crime, and who never fired a weapon during the raid -- was charged with two counts of attempted murder, two counts of first-degree assault on a police officer, and two counts of committing a crime of violence. Pete Garcia spent nine months in solitary confinement before the raiding officers&#039; cover-up was revealed. He was subsequently released, and filed a civil rights suit in federal court.

At about 6:58 p.m., police responded to a report of a bog bite in the area of 2120 N.E. 24th Terrace. Officer Mathew Lemos learned the victim had been walking along the street when a brown and white dog ran out from between two houses and bit him on the leg, according to a police report. Lee County Animal Control Officer Danielle Jersey arrived and located the dog in front of the homes at 2111 and 2115 N.E. 24th Terrace. The dogs hackles were reportedly up, a sign of aggression, and it initially prevented her from exiting the van. Jersey attempted to contact the dog&rsquo;s owner by phone without success. The report states that the victim identified the dog as the one that bit him. This was the third LCAC contact in reference to the dog, the prior calls being for an aggressive dog. Jersey determined that the dog needed to be removed from the area due to public safety concerns, according to the report. As Jersey attempted to capture the dog with a control pole and noose, Lemos had to use his baton to keep the dog at bay as it continued to make aggressive advances. After several attempts at capturing the dog, the dog charged Jersey, then turned on Lemos and began to charge the officer. Lemos drew his service weapon and fired three shots, striking the dog in the chest and euthanizing it, the report states. About five to 10 minutes later, the owner of the dog arrived home and made contact with Lemos and LCAC. Due to the family&rsquo;s &ldquo;hostility and emotional distress brought on by the loss of the animal,&rdquo; police left and Jersey advised that she would return at a later date to serve a citation to the dog&rsquo;s owner in reference to the animal being loose and biting a man, according to the report.

Plaintiff Kimberly Larsen was the owner of &quot;Heidi,&quot; a purebred Rottweiler. Larsen testified that Heidi always wore a collar and tags. On January 10, 1997, Larsen left Heidi in her fenced yard while she and a family member left to run some errands. That same day, Officer Perdue responded to a call about a large, vicious Rottweiler that was loose and had chased and attacked, or attempted to attack, a citizen. When Officer Perdue arrived on the scene, he spoke with Willie Sturdivant, the citizen who had reported the incident. Sturdivant told Perdue that he had been chased by the dog and had only been able to escape the attack by beating the dog off with a stick. Sturdivant was scared to walk back down the street, so Officer Perdue gave him a ride. After dropping off Sturdivant, Officer Perdue began searching for the loose dog. A local woman told Perdue to be careful of the dog because it was dangerous and aggressive and had been in the streets chasing cars and people. She also told him where the owners of the dog lived, although she noted that they were not home. Perdue next came upon Charles Elkins, a neighbor of the Larsens, walking on the street, and he stopped to warn Elkins about the loose dog. Elkins reported that the dog lived at the Larsens&#039; and directed Perdue to the house. Officer Perdue pulled into the Larsens&#039; driveway, exited his vehicle with his shotgun, and began to walk toward the home. Elkins observed what happened next from a distance of about 150 feet. He said that as Perdue walked toward the home, Heidi came walking around the corner of the house. Heidi slowly approached Perdue and jumped or lunged from the driveway up into the yard. At this point, Heidi was ten to twelve feet from Perdue. Heidi then stopped, turned around, and began walking away from Perdue toward the street. Perdue then fired, striking Heidi in the hindquarters. He fired again to end the animal&#039;s suffering. Perdue dragged Heidi&#039;s remains to the end of the driveway and called sanitation to dispose of the body. He then left the scene.','https://puppycidedb.com/datasets.html#highpoint_nc','Heidi','Bobby Ray Perdue','1','0',0,0,0,2,2,'Uniform',0,2,2,2,1,2),(1406,'1997-02-08','North Carolina','High Point','High Point Police Department, High Point Police Department Animal Control',2,10,0,'Mixed Breed, 7 months old','From United States Court of Appeals, Fourth Circuit.

The dogs&#039; mother was a Siberian Husky mixed-breed dog; it is unclear what breed their father was. The dogs wore collars but did not wear tags. They were kept in a pen in Frye&#039;s backyard but had a tendency to dig under the pen and escape. Perdue remembers things happening differently. According to Perdue, he saw the Rottweiler standing in the middle of the street. The Rottweiler was big and acting in a crazed, aggressive manner by growling and moving back and forth. The animal suddenly charged him and he used deadly force in self-defense. On the morning of February 8, 1997, Officer Berman of the High Point Police Department responded to a call about a pack of dogs chasing people. According to him, when he arrived on the scene, the dogs charged his car, growling and showing their teeth. In the pack were three of Frye&#039;s dogs and two larger strays. Officer Berman remained in his car and called for Officer Perdue. While Berman waited for Perdue to arrive, the dogs ran across the street and began harassing a woman who was trying to exit her vehicle. Berman drove over and blew an air horn to disperse the dogs. The dogs ran, and the woman was able to leave her car and get to her residence. A man then came out of the residence. One of the dogs tried to bite him, but Berman again dispersed the dogs with his horn. Shortly thereafter, Perdue arrived on the scene. The dogs aggressively rushed his truck as soon as he pulled up. One of the dogs jumped into the window of his truck and Perdue had to beat if off with his nightstick. When he exited the vehicle, the pack attacked him and Perdue fired into it with his shotgun, killing two of the dogs (Bandit and Tut-Tut). The rest of the pack disbursed.

Plaintiff Gilbert Wallace owned a Golden Retriever/Labrador mixed-breed dog named &quot;Sundance.&quot; Wallace asserts that Sundance was a well-behaved, passive dog, but that he had a habit of escaping from his fenced-in yard by digging under the fence. Wallace had several other dogs, which he also kept in a fenced area. Wallace had been cited on six previous occasions for allowing his dogs to run loose, and he had been warned about the poor condition of his fence. In addition, Officer Moxley had previously told Wallace that his dogs were becoming more aggressive. On January 25, 1999, High Point Police Officer Blue responded to a call that a dog had bitten someone. When he arrived at the scene, a dog that Officer Blue described as a &quot;black chow-lab mix,&quot; Sundance, charged him. Blue racked his shotgun, and the animal stopped, but continued to growl. Blue radioed for animal control to respond. Blue then interviewed the bite victim, Lonnie Baldwin. Baldwin told Blue that the dog had chased his child to the bus stop. Baldwin chased the dog to protect his child, and the dog bit him on the hand. As Baldwin and Blue were talking, Officer Moxley arrived on the scene along with Officer Perdue. At this point, Sundance had retreated to Wallace&#039;s yard and was sitting outside the fence. Moxley informed Baldwin and Blue that this dog had given him problems in the past. He then got back in his truck and drove the short distance to the Wallace house. Moxley exited his vehicle with his shotgun and proceeded toward the rear of the truck. At this point, Sundance charged at full speed, growling and showing his teeth. Moxley raised his shotgun and fired when Sundance was about five yards away, killing the dog.

According to the Altmans, Hot Rod was a non-aggressive, obedient dog, who always wore his collar and tags as required by law. On the morning of March 24, 2000, Hot Rod was wandering the streets alone. Terry Evans, who owned a local business, saw Hot Rod following a meter reader, Roger Hendricks. Evans was familiar with Hot Rod, having seen him on the street before and having seen him behave aggressively. Fearing for Hendricks&#039; safety, Evans called 911. When Officer Moxley arrived, Hot Rod &quot;took off&quot; toward the residential houses located further down the street. Moxley exited his vehicle with his shotgun and gave chase. Moxley fired between two of the houses in the direction of Hot Rod, who was about 75 yards away. Hot Rod was running behind the houses, and Moxley was running in front of the houses. He fired again between two houses in the direction of Hot Rod, who was approximately 50 to 60 yards away. Moxley fired a third shot, and Evans heard Hot Rod &quot;hollar.&quot; Hot Rod emerged from behind the houses bleeding and dragging his hind leg, but was still running. Moxley had Hendricks retrieve more shells from his truck, and then pursued the dog. A short time later, a fourth shot was heard and Moxley emerged dragging the remains of Hot Rod. Moxley recalls a different version of the events. According to him, when he arrived at the scene, Hot Rod was growling at Hendricks from under some bushes. Moxley got out of his truck with his shotgun and proceeded toward the back of the truck to get his catchpole. Hot Rod charged, but stopped and retreated when Moxley raised his gun. Moxley continued toward the rear of his truck when Hot Rod charged again. This time, Moxley fired, wounding but not killing the dog. Hot Rod ran, and Moxley pursued, firing twice more.

The dogs, described as pit bull mixes, bit the officer several times in the leg after he responded to reports of aggressive strays in the 100 block of Division Street by employees of the Del Monte plant at 10:45 p.m. Tuesday. The officer drove the dogs off with pepper spray and was treated for bite wounds at a local hospital and released. Hours later, shortly before 4 a.m., the same pack attacked a man as he walked his border collie along railroad tracks in the same area, police said. An employee of a nearby business heard the man&rsquo;s cries for help and was able to drive the dogs off by throwing large rocks at them and striking them with a wooden post. The 48-year-old victim, who was not identified, was taken to a local hospital with numerous bite wounds to his head, face, arms, torso and legs. Police described his injuries as severe, but said he and his dog are expected to survive. Following the second attack, a team of seven officers began hunting the dogs on foot. They shot two of them, one fatally and gave one a probable fatal wound based on a blood trail in the area. However, the wounded dog ran from the area with the third dog, a tan pit bull mix that weighs about 25 to 30 pounds. The dogs remain at large. The public is being urged to be cautious in the area, particularly in southeast Yakima neighborhoods as police and animal control officers search for the animals. In Yakima, pit bulls have been banned as a breed since a series of attacks in 1996. Even so, attacks involving the breed crop up periodically. In 2007, a pit bull attacked a child on North 24th Avenue despite neighborhood complaints about the dog. In 2004, five pit bulls were seized from a home on North Naches Avenue after they mauled a 15-year-old boy. The dogs belonged to the boy&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s boyfriend. Lt. Nolan Wentz, a spokesman for the Yakima Police Department, said the dogs appeared to be wild. They had no collars and appeared to be living in the area along the tracks. &ldquo;That might be why we didn&rsquo;t hear about them until now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t any residents there.&rdquo;','http://www.tri-cityherald.com/2013/08/22/2534454_trio-of-dogs-attacks-cop-yakima.html?rh=1','Unknown','Unknown','1','0',0,1,0,3,3,'Uniform',1,3,0,0,0,0),(1423,'2013-09-28','Washington','Chehalis','Chehalis Police Department',1,10,0,'Dachshund mix, 6 yo','From Lewis County Sirens News - A 68-year-old Chehalis man has contacted an attorney after retrieving his dog from the city animal shelter and finding it had a broken jaw. Bruce Beauregard is both steaming mad and broken hearted about his 6-year-old Dachshund-mix he called Rowdy. Beauregard was alarmed when the police officer sent to collect his pet said the dog was aggressive so he &ldquo;offered him his boot&rdquo; and then horrified when he saw his dog sitting in the kennel with his head hanging down and his face smashed up. He said he was afraid to look closely, but when he rushed to his veterinarian, his fears were confirmed. &ldquo;The poor little guy, he couldn&rsquo;t even lick me or lick my face,&rdquo; he said. The 16-pound dog was euthanized the same day. The city denies the animal was kicked, but it&rsquo;s an injury the veterinarian said he hasn&rsquo;t seen in 30 years of practice. The bone was fractured completely, not just cracked, on both sides, according to Dr. Mark Giffey. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a little unusual to see both the left and right side, because usually there is an impact site,&rdquo; Giffey said. Chehalis Police Department Officer Bruce Thompson stated in a written report the Dachshund lunged at him so he offered the left toe of his shoe as a barrier. Thompson wrote the animal bit the toe and as it shook its head from side to side he heard a snapping sound; the dog let go and backed away. Police Chief Glenn Schaffer said he has absolutely no doubt it happened the way his officer described. &ldquo;What Officer Thompson did is what anybody would do if about to get bit,&rdquo; Schaffer said. &ldquo;Offering a dog a shoe to bite is better than offering an arm or a hand.&rdquo; For Beauregard, a bachelor, whose constant companion is now buried in his backyard, the explanation doesn&rsquo;t pass the smell test. He&rsquo;s hoping his lawyer can make things right. &ldquo;I want to prosecute the guy that did this,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s awful, uncalled for and totally inhumane. &ldquo;If I did that to my neighbor dog, I know would happen to me. I&rsquo;d be arrested, put in jail and fined for animal cruelty.&rdquo; Rowdy&rsquo;s stay in the city&rsquo;s temporary animal holding facility at the end of last month was unplanned. It began the evening of Aug. 23 when Beauregard was pulled over by a Chehalis police officer for weaving down South Market Boulevard and arrested for drunk driving. According to the police report, the small dog in his truck was very aggressive when a second officer came to take the dog away. Chief Schaffer points out the two officers got Beauregard out of the back of the patrol car and out of his handcuffs so he could assist in moving the dog. Beauregard said he helped them leash and muzzle Rowdy who was understandably upset. &ldquo;He was very protective of me, and didn&rsquo;t like strangers handling me,&rdquo; he said. He said he warned them his pet wouldn&rsquo;t like going to a kennel, wouldn&rsquo;t be happy and wouldn&rsquo;t eat. Rowdy was taken to the city&rsquo;s shelter off Kresky Avenue and after the officer finished getting breath samples and filling out paperwork, Beauregard was given his citation and then a ride to his home. He tried to pick his dog up the following day, he said, but was told he had to wait until Monday morning. Beauregard&rsquo;s longtime buddy Scott Fanning who went with him described the same kind of puzzlement and apprehension when Officer Thompson addressed the men before opening the shelter door. &ldquo;He said, he was pretty aggressive when I was trying to get him. He was attacking me so I offered him my right boot,&rdquo; Fanning said. Once they got inside, they saw Rowdy with blood on his face, his jaw hanging and one tooth bent outward. The officer was saying he thought the dog&rsquo;s tooth was hurt and Beauregard was getting hot, asking who did it, who was taking care of his dog, Fanning said.  Thompson replied he didn&rsquo;t know, he said. Fanning hustled his friend and the dog out the door and to the veterinary office, he said. Two weeks later, Fanning said he still gets sick thinking about what transpired between a &ldquo;big cop and a little dog&rdquo;. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m still crying, I can&rsquo;t take it,&rdquo; Fanning said. &ldquo;He was one of my dog&rsquo;s best friends.&rdquo; At the Chehalis Centralia Veterinary Hospital, Rowdy was shaking like an outboard motor, Beauregard said. &ldquo;I think he said we could probably save him, or we could try to save him,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t recall exactly. I was crying.&rdquo; Fanning said he was too upset to stay at the clinic in support of his friend. Both men knew it wasn&rsquo;t realistic to to send Rowdy to an orthopedic veterinary specialist who would attach metal plates to the fractures. &ldquo;When you get a broken jaw, that&rsquo;s like a death sentence, cause dogs aren&rsquo;t gonna lay around and suck on a straw and watch TV while they heal,&rdquo; Fanning said. Dr. Giffey said he&rsquo;s thought about it a lot, wondering if the force of a dog&rsquo;s jaw closing on a boot is strong enough to break the bones. It&rsquo;s something he&rsquo;s never encountered in three decades of treating animals, he said. Whether twisting or shaking could explain it, would be a question for an orthopedist, he said. &ldquo;The police officer was the only witness to the injury, so I guess that&rsquo;s where it stands at,&rdquo; Giffey said. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen that myself.&rdquo; Weeks later, Beauregard is spending more time fishing with his friends and less time at home, because his quiet house reminds him that Rowdy&rsquo;s dead. &ldquo;For six years he slept with me, never left my side,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Day and night, 24 -seven. It&rsquo;s pretty strange not having him.&rdquo; But hanging out on the Cowlitz River fishing with his buddies who always bring along their dogs isn&rsquo;t entirely better. &ldquo;Out there, all these dogs out there running around, and mine&rsquo;s not there,&rdquo; he said.','http://www.lewiscountysirens.com/?p=21293','Rowdy','Bruce Thompson, two Unknown police','1','0',0,0,0,1,1,'Uniform',3,3,2,2,2,0),(1424,'2008-06-26','Washington','Yakima','Yakima City Police Department',1,2,1,'Unconfirmed','From the Yakima Herald-Republic - Police shot a pit bull multiple times Thursday night during an attempt to locate a suspect wanted by the Yakima County Sheriff&#039;s Office.

The victim, six-year-old Zainabou Drame, is listed in critical but stable condition at Children&#039;s Hospital. She was outside playing in her Westwood neighborhood with her brother, only a few houses down the street from where she lives, when two pit bulls attacked. &quot;They knocked her down then the dogs started chewing on her face and blood started coming everywhere. They ripped her jaw off,&quot; said nine-year-old Moustapha Drame, the victim&#039;s brother who witnessed the attack. Responding officers arrived at the scene in the 2900 block of Aquadale Lane when the dogs were still actively attacking the child on the sidewalk. Police said four officers distracted the dogs and then fired shots, killing both of them. A third dog, not involved in the attack, is now in the custody of the SPCA. Zainabou Drame&#039;s grandfather credits the mother with saving her life. He said she used a baseball bat to fight the dogs off her daughter. 24-year-old Zontae Irby owns the dogs and was arrested early Thursday morning. Police searched Irby&#039;s home and charged him with weapons under disability, drug abuse and drug trafficking. Charges are pending in relation to the dog attack, Cincinnati Police say. Operations Director of the Cincinnati SPCA Mike Retzlaff, said pit bull owners have a responsibility to keep their animals under control. &quot;The people that are owning them in these cases don&#039;t take the proper time with them, training them, just making them good citizens and therefore they&#039;re going to be in the headlines,&quot; said Retzlaff.

The investigation will examine the actions of the officer who shot Bosco, the officer assigned to control the dog, and other police who were working at the scene when the shooting occurred. The inquiry is likely to be done in January, and the police department might make changes in training classes or tactical procedures after reviewing the results, Chief John DiVenere said. ``We&#039;re going to look at everything. We want to know what went wrong and make sure it doesn&#039;t happen again,&#039;&#039; DiVenere said. Bosco, a German shepherd that served as a police dog for two years, was killed by a shotgun blast Tuesday morning when he attacked Officer Bryan Aleia. Several police officers had surrounded the house at 30 Sims Road after the homeowner reported that his loaded pistols had been stolen and that he thought the burglars were still in his basement. Aleia stood watch in the backyard, and Officer Greg Blackinton, Bosco&#039;s handler, brought the dog through a front door to search the house. Police evidently didn&#039;t realize that the door to the backyard had been left open. Blackinton released the dog, and it raced through the house, out the back door and directly at Aleia. The dog bit the veteran patrol officer, pulled away, and then charged back toward him, police said. Blackinton was still at the front of the house, and could not call off Bosco, police said. Aleia fired a 12-gauge shotgun at close range, killing the dog, police said. Aleia&#039;s wound required several stitches. He initially returned to work, but is now out on medical leave, DiVenere said. Blackinton was given time off and is expected to be back to work this weekend. ``It&#039;s important to an officer&#039;s own peace of mind to get back to work after something like that,&#039;&#039; DiVenere said. Bosco was trained to respond only to Blackinton&#039;s commands and would not be expected to distinguish between other officers and criminal suspects, DiVenere said. A detective sergeant will investigate and present his findings to a panel of police commanders, including Det. Lt. Thomas Killiany, Lt. Thomas Grimaldi and Capt. Daniel McIntyre. They will determine if Aleia and Blackinton followed proper procedures, whether Aleia should have fired his weapon, whether Blackinton should have released Bosco from his leash, and who was responsible for ensuring that all exits to the building were closed. DiVenere said he wants to be sure that if any procedures were at fault, they will be corrected for the future through better training.

Brown, a supervisor in that department&#039;s canine unit, said police dogs should never be unleashed during a building search if any exits are left open. ``You cannot take the dog off the leash if there&#039;s a remote possibility that the building isn&#039;t secure,&#039;&#039; Brown said.

The city was already negotiating to buy another police dog from a European breeder and will now seek to buy two. The dogs cost $9,000 to $10,000 each. Many residents and businesses have offered contributions during the past two days, police said.','http://articles.courant.com/2005-12-24/news/0512240655_1_police-dog-bosco-memphis-police','Bosco','Bryan Aleia - shooter, Greg Blackinton - K9 handler','1','0',2,1,1,2,2,'Uniform',1,3,2,2,2,2),(1438,'2005-10-17','New Mexico','Albuquerque','Bernalillo County Sheriffs Department',1,50,0,'Belgian Malinois, 6yo','From &quot;Canine shot for attacking police officer&quot; By Maggie Shepard, Albuquerque Tribune Issue October 18th 2005 - A Bernalillo County sheriff&#039;s canine apparently mistook a deputy for a fleeing armed robbery suspect, and the error cost the dog its life. The deputy shot the dog to get it off her deeply punctured arm about 11 a.m. Monday, department spokeswoman Erin Kinnard said. Deputy Heather Schreckendgust underwent surgery for her arm injury Monday afternoon. Kinnard said the deputy&#039;s prognosis wasn&#039;t clear. Schreckendgust was guarding a stash of stolen items while other deputies and canine units searched the ditch banks and surrounding areas near Le Avenue and Isleta Boulevard Southwest in the South Valley. Kinnard said deputies were looking for suspects in a stabbing call at the Malpais Chevron gas station at Isleta Boulevard and Malpais Road Southwest. Deputies chased the car along a ditch, where it crashed and two of three suspects were apprehended, Kinnard said. A third suspect was caught about 8 p.m. Schreckendgust was monitoring a pile of stolen goods when the canine, Bart, emerged from foliage and bit her arm, Undersheriff Sal Baragiola said. She fired three shots and the dog died instantly. Bart&#039;s handler, Deputy Larry Harlan was about 10 seconds behind his dog when he heard calls for help, Baragiola said. Baragiola said it isn&#039;t unusual for dogs to bite suspects, but they routinely ignore deputies. Schreckendgust was in plainclothes and possibly an official jacket, Kinnard said. &quot;Was that a factor? We don&#039;t know. We just don&#039;t know what made him bite her,&quot; Baragiola said. Bart, a Belgian Malinois, was about 6 years old and has spent about four years on the force. Kinnard said the dog&#039;s actions are the subject of one pending lawsuit against the department. She said it is just a coincidence that his name is the same as an Albuquerque Police Department canine that has been named in lawsuits for excessive biting.

Witnesses reported that gunfire was exchanged around 11:15 p.m. Monday between a white Ford pickup truck and a green Saturn sedan as the drivers raced northbound on 64th Street from Thomas Road. Five people were transported to area hospitals, including those who dived into the canal to help victims after the drivers lost control, the Fire Department said. One of the women was shot in the head and was in extremely critical condition, according to police. The other woman was shot in the back. Both women were recent immigrants from Mexico, smuggled across the U.S. border by &quot;coyotes&quot; during the past few days, Scottsdale police said. Police are investigating the incident with immigration officials. One male suspect, who police said was connected to a coyote smuggling operation, was arrested after he fled the scene of the accident. At least one other suspect, who was in the truck with the arrested man, is still wanted in connection with the violence. Meanwhile, a police K-9 working dog was shot and wounded by an officer. The dog accidentally bit the officer as police searched for suspects from the shooting, police said. The accident shut down Indian School Road westbound between 64th and 68th streets early Tuesday as Scottsdale police worked to recover evidence from the canal. Police Sgt. Mark Clark said the accident involved at least six people. The shooters have yet to be identified. Two men were in the pickup truck. Four people, two men and the two women who were shot, were in the Saturn. Clark said a connection was evident between the two vehicles, although police were working to determine why shots were fired. &quot;We don&#039;t know how long the confrontation was going on,&quot; Clark said. &quot;Our first indication was from another motorist who saw the two cars smashing into each other.&quot; Clark added that it was possible the road-rage chase began outside Scottsdale because the scene of the accident is close to Phoenix and Tempe. After the two vehicles crashed into the canal, the two male suspects from the pickup reportedly fled on foot. The source link for this article points to the paywall.

Apparently a drunk woman had refused to exit her car in the vicinity of Brookdale and Canyon, and one of her two dogs (pits?) jumped out an open window and menaced the officers, who then shot the dog. The other dog was controlled through the open window by Animal Control officers, allowing the officers to arrest the woman for DUI. I read the Pierce County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department report on the incident and can report: A deputy spotted a vehicle parked at 48th Avenue East and Brookdale Road East at 1:48 a.m. Monday and investigated. The deputy found the driver slumped over the wheel and initially not responsive. Her passenger side window was open and the driver&rsquo;s side window was open. The report states there were two aggressive pitbulls in the vehicle. The deputy tried to wake up the driver using the patrol car&rsquo;s lights and horn. Another deputy arrived to assist. The dogs were both barking and jumping around the car. A sergeant and fire personnel also responded to check on the driver&rsquo;s condition. She was unresponsive for 15 minutes, then she gained some responsiveness but her speech was slurred and attention span limited. She was barely able to understand/answer questions. A deputy repeatedly told her to roll up her windows so the dogs could not get out. She didn&rsquo;t respond and yelled at the dogs. One of the pitbulls jumped out of the vehicle through the passenger window. The dog ran toward one of the deputies. The deputy backed up but the dog kept charging at full speed, the report states. The deputy shot the dog once in the head. The dog dropped to the ground. The driver then rolled her passenger window up and got out of the car without the other dog escaping. Paramedics checked out the woman and found no medical issues. Her vehicle was secured and she was arrested for driving with a suspended license and physical control of a vehicle while intoxicated. An animal control officer responded to the scene and took the pit bull from the backseat of the vehicle. The report says nothing more about the shot dog.','http://blog.thenewstribune.com/crime/2008/08/26/deputy-shoots-dog-while-investigating-traffic-stop-on-brookdale/','Unknown','Unknown police, unknown animal control, unknown paramedics','1','0',2,2,0,1,1,'Uniform',3,3,2,2,2,0),(1441,'2008-07-20','Washington','Oakville','Grays Harbor County Sheriffs Department',1,2,1,'Unconfirmed','From The Chronicle: A sheriffs deputys fatal shooting of a pit bull that charged him in Oakville over the weekend was determined to be a justifiable use of his department firearm, the Grays Harbor County Sheriffs Department said on Tuesday.

The officers were called to the 1900 block of North Chestnut Street for a dispute and fight. &quot;They were investigating a dispute/fight call and during the course of their investigation it was revealed that allegedly a dog was used in commission of the assault,&quot; Ellensburg Police Department Capt. Dan Hansberry said. Whether or not the pit bull mix was actually used in the assault is still under investigation. The dog owner claimed the dog was not used in the assault, while a witness claimed that it was. Officers asked to see the dog, as long as the owner could control it and keep it on a leash. According to Hansberry, once the dog was brought out, it began lunging toward the officers. The officers asked the owner to take it back inside. Hansberry said the owner tried to get the dog inside, but it slipped out of its collar and charged after one of the officers. Hansberry said the officer began backing away from the dog, who was &quot;clearly attempting to attack the officer.&quot; The officer shot at the dog once and missed. Hansberry said it is believed the officer was aiming toward the ground as the dog charged. Hansberry said the dog then turned after the first shot and went after the second officer &quot;in the same attack mode.&quot; The second officer shot three times, resulting in the death of the dog. &quot;As there is in most incidents like this, there is differing opinions to what occurred,&quot; Hansberry said. &quot;But from the officer&#039;s reports, they had no other option at the time but to use deadly force to stop the dog unfortunately.&quot; The deceased dog was taken to the animal control center.Arrangements have been made for the owner to pick up his pet, where he will be able to bury or cremate the dog. &quot;Whenever an owner loses a pet, it&#039;s very upsetting, especially in a situation like that,&quot; Hansberry said. &quot;(The owner) wished that this didn&#039;t happen, but he has told us that he understands why the officers did what they did.&quot; There were no previous problems with the pit bull mix. The dog was licensed in Spokane. Officers were required to fill out a report following the incident. A detective was called on scene to collect evidence and conduct interviews. Hansberry said an internal review was also conducted. Hansberry was unable to find the date of the last time an officer had to use deadly force in Ellensburg, but did recall that it also involved the shooting of a dog that was attacking an officer.','http://www.dailyrecordnews.com/news/ellensburg-police-shoot-dog/article_57c99d21-2f58-56a6-9d17-008583a7dbec.html','Unknown','Unknown','1','0',2,2,0,2,2,'Uniform',0,2,2,0,0,0),(1443,'2008-04-17','South Carolina','Charleston','Charleston City Police, North Charleston Police, Charleston County Sheriffs Office, South Carolina State Law Enforcement Division, US Marshall Service',1,2,0,'Unconfirmed','From &quot;Charleston drug sweep: only 4 suspects at large&quot;, By Hatzel Vela of\r\nLive 5 News as reproduced on the website of Scarlett A. Wilson Ninth Judicial Circuit Solicitor: CHARLESTON, SC (WCSC) - Charleston City Police have arrested 15 people and issued arrest warrants for 15 others in a drug bust on the East side of Charleston Thursday. Over an eight hour period, suspects were arrested Thursday for being involved in the distribution of heroin and crack cocaine. Two others turned themselves in to police. Of those served arrest warrants, five were already in jail on other charges. The bust was part of an eight month operation whose goal was to identify and track down key drug dealers. &quot;These people just don&#039;t sell drugs. They sell intimidation. They scare people. They create fear,&quot; said Charleston City Police Chief Greg Mullen. Mullen said phase one of the operation involved new cooperation efforts between the Charleston Police Department and the Ninth Circuit Solicitor&#039;s Office. The city is using drug money to pay a prosecutor, whose sole assignment is to work with the narcotics unit. &quot;When a prosecutor is on the ground, knowing who all the players are&hellip;they can better allocate their time. They know who the big fish really are. They know who the violent folks really are,&quot; said Scarlett Wilson, Ninth Circuit Solicitor. The agreement has been in effect since last July. The solicitor&#039;s office receives $50,000 from the police department to help pay for the prosecutor&#039;s salary. In addition to the help from the prosecutor, police used street-level officers to crack down on buyers first. In six months, there were dozens of arrests and some 200 drug-related offenses, Mullen said. Intelligence and help from the prosecutor helped track down what Mullen called an &quot;all-star list&quot; of suspected drug dealers. More than 60 officers from Charleston Police, North Charleston Police, Charleston County Sheriff&#039;s Office, State Law Enforcement Division and U.S. Marshall&#039;s Service helped round up the suspects in Thursday&#039;s bust, which Mullen said helped disrupt a network of drug dealers. &quot;We know them, we&#039;re familiar with them and when we learned through intelligence that they were the ones who were actually carrying out the distribution, then that&#039;s when started focusing on them,&quot; Mullen said of the 30 suspects. Mullen and Wilson were not surprised many of the suspects who were allegedly part of this network were repeat offenders. Both have advocated for tougher bond, parole and probation laws. &quot;A vast majority of these 30 have been in the criminal justice system before,&quot; Mullen said. Half of the suspects are on probation or parole; a third are out on bond and half are repeat offenders, Mullen said. Wilson cited Michael Hayes as an example. Hayes was arrested in 2006 for the murder of David Hamilton, but was later set free because prosecutors say witnesses in the case fell through. Hayes was arrested in Thursday&#039;s bust. Mullen cited another example. George Bellinger was out on bond, he said. Bellinger was arrested in 2007 for the murder of 15-year old Montrell Harrell. &quot;The violence and the drugs go hand in hand. And if we can make an arrest on a drug case and get a good sentence, so be it. It&#039;s better than having another victim,&quot; Wilson said. Wilson and Mullen agree their new arrangement is providing good results. &quot;We&#039;re seeing people call us and give us information about where drugs are being hid. They&#039;re calling us and telling us about people that are actively in distribution,&quot; Mullen said. Eight officers who are assigned to the area are building relationships and trust, he said. &quot;In the past, we&#039;ve never seen that kind of cooperation in these neighborhoods,&quot; Mullen said. Wilson&#039;s office will move to revoke the bonds of those who were out on bond and were arrested. During the bust, police were able to seize some drugs and three handguns. Mullen said they were not looking for large seizures, rather to disrupt the drug dealer network and put people in jail. Mullen also revealed during the operation, a dog attacked an officer. The dog was shot and the officer is said to be doing fine.','https://web.archive.org/web/20130412013231/http://www.scsolicitor9.org/drug-sweep.htm','Unknown','Unknown','2','2',2,0,2,2,2,'Uniform',2,2,2,0,2,0),(1444,'2009-05-06','South Carolina','Charleston','Charleston County Sheriffs Office',1,50,0,'German Shepherd','From the Post and Courier, based entirely on uncorroborated police statements - A Charleston County sheriff&#039;s deputy shot and killed a German shepherd after the dog growled and charged at him Saturday in West Ashley, deputies said.

A 911 call came in about 2:20 p.m. from the area of Eight Street and Harrison, said Officer Harold McClure, a public information officer for the Wichita Falls Police Department. As officers with the WFPD worked at 2011 Eighth Street, trying to get the dogs off Castro, an officer was shot, McClure said. The officer&#039;s wound was not life-threatening, according to a news release from the WFPD. Police did not release his name Wednesday. First responders were poised to jump in as soon as the dogs were out of the way so they could get to Castro. Police officers were already there and working to get the dogs off of her, Lt. Chris Duncan with the Wichita Falls Fire Department, said. &quot;It&#039;s tough to see somebody in need,&quot; he said.

The incident occurred about 8 p.m. at a home on North Beto Garcia Road, just north of the intersection of Mile 12 1/2 North and Farm-to-Market Road 88. Deputies arrived at the scene to find the child&#039;s aunt holding his lifeless body in her arms and the dog still in the front yard. The dog fled after a deputy shot and wounded it, and authorities were still trying to subdue the animal late Wednesday. Hidalgo County Justice of the Peace Rosa Trevi&ntilde;o pronounced the boy dead at the scene shortly after 9 p.m. She said the condition of the child&#039;s body suggested there was no way emergency responders could have saved the boy&#039;s life. Sheriff&#039;s deputies were still at the scene investigating late Wednesday, trying to determine if negligence was a factor in the incident. The sheriff declined to speculate on whether any criminal charges would be filed, noting deputies must determine whether the dog had been confined and how the boy came into contact with the animal. Neighbors told deputies the dog was always chained up, an assertion supported by local activist Beto Garcia - namesake of the road where the mauling occurred. However, one witness told The Monitor the animal was not restrained just before the incident. Sheriff Trevi&ntilde;o declined to identify the boy pending notification of his mother, who lives and works in the state of Washington. The boy&#039;s father resides in Mexico. The sheriff said the boy, whom neighbors identified as Pablo Hernandez, had been living with his aunt and uncle after Child Protective Services placed him with them. The circumstances of that placement were not immediately known, but the sheriff said his office had no record of being called out to the house before. Luis Palomo, 20, said he was about four houses down the street playing football with his friends when the trouble began. The boy was at home with a babysitter when a pit bull at the house began running around the front yard in an excited manner, getting a second pit bull inside the home riled up. The babysitter and boy were inside the house with the second dog and were clearly fearful, Palomo said. He went over to help them and managed to distract the dogs temporarily, but the boy wandered out the back door. One of the dogs grabbed him by the torso and dragged him. Palomo recalled hearing about 20 seconds of screaming, and then nothing. He said the dog locked its jaws around the boy&#039;s neck, quickly killing him. &quot;These types of accidents can be prevented,&quot; Justice of the Peace Trevi&ntilde;o said, cautioning the public about owning pit bulls. &quot;No one needs to keep these types of dogs,&quot; she said. &quot;These dogs turn on you.&quot;','http://www.themonitor.com/boy-killed-by-pit-bull-near-weslaco/article_204a49e0-657e-5461-9b79-dffb192b7131.html?mode=jqm','Unknown','Unknown','1','0',1,1,0,2,2,'Uniform',1,2,2,2,0,0),(1450,'2008-03-06','Texas','San Juan','San Juan Police Department',1,2,1,'Unconfirmed','From The Monitor, based on uncorroborated Police statements:  A man running from police sicced dogs on officers, rammed a police car and shielded himself with his small nephew on Thursday, police said.

The car sped off when police tried to pull it over. Police said the driver, David Martinez, 21, then drove to his residence on the 1500 block of Chula Vista Drive. Officers attempted to enter the house and they say he released several dogs on them. Police backed off then returned after dawn break with a warrant for Martinez&rsquo;s arrest on seven felony charges of aggravated assault of a peace officer and evading arrest. A surveillance team, which had been watching the house, spotted Martinez drive away from his home shortly before noon. He rammed an officer&rsquo;s vehicle about a block from his house, jumped out of his car and ran back home. As police chased him, a pit bull attacked one of the officers, officials said. An officer shot the pit bull, which was taken to the Humane Society. Police said the dog later died.\r\nAfter Martinez ran into his home, police said he shielded himself with his toddler-aged nephew and a short stand off ensued. Robles said police had to warn, then push the man&rsquo;s sister, Maria Elena Martinez, out of their way.\r\nMartinez&rsquo;s brother-in-law Jose Tamez said Maria Elena was only acting out of concern for her child. The child suffered no injuries and she was taken away in an ambulance for treatment of minor injuries. Police said theyfound a small amount of cocaine on him when they arrested the 21-year-old man.

Greg Stevens. Shortly before that, the dog and another pit bull charged at a man trying to get into his truck, and he called police to report it. Similar dog incidents are happening throughout the city and county - many of which aren&#039;t reported by the media. Sandy Deel said her south Lubbock County neighborhood is one of those that has a problem with roaming dogs. She said she and her family are nervous about going outside because of two pit bulls that frequently get loose from their owner&#039;s property - the same dogs, they believe, that killed two of their goats about two weeks ago. And the family doesn&#039;t go outside after dark anymore. &quot;(The pit bulls) have been scaring people, growling and barking at the neighbors,&quot; Deel said. &quot;And (they) even cornered one couple while they were walking their dogs and also a little girl playing basketball.&quot; Lubbock Animal Services, which doesn&#039;t respond to incidents outside city limits, handled about 800 calls between Jan. 1 and Feb. 7 regarding loose dogs. &quot;Our calls for service have been enormous,&quot; said Kevin Overstreet, animal services director. &quot;With the amount of coverage we&#039;ve received from the news media, I think that&#039;s increased public awareness.&quot; City officials cite owner irresponsibility as the main cause of the problem - city ordinance requires dogs be on a leash. Owners of dogs caught roaming free face a Class C misdemeanor and a $165 fine. Though the police officer&#039;s encounter on Tuesday in the 2100 bock of Juneau Avenue ended peacefully - the shot missed the dog and the resident escaped into his vehicle - there have been several significant attacks in the past two weeks. Pit bulls killed a dozen goats in Lubbock County and injured four miniature horses and killed one in an attack in the city. The owner of the pit bulls that got loose on Tuesday was cited.','https://web.archive.org/web/20090211053440/http://lubbockonline.com/stories/021408/loc_246809520.shtml','Unknown','Unknown','2','1',2,0,0,2,1,'Not Sure',2,2,2,2,2,2),(1454,'2008-01-06','Texas','Lubbock','Lubbock Police Department, Lubbock Animal Services',1,50,1,'Unconfirmed','From local NBC affiliate KCBD: Lubbock Police say he ordered his dog to attack.

Noise complaints brought police to the house and when the garage opened, police say the owner said quote &quot;sic&#039; em&quot; and that is when police shot the dog. The dog&#039;s owner, Jimmy Cruz was arrested for aggravated assault. The 22-year-old is now out of jail and sharing his side of the story. Soon after Lubbock Police arrived at the home in the 6000 block of 3rd street, this is what an officer&#039;s dash camera recorded: It sounds like you hear Cruz say &quot;Sic em&quot; boy.&quot; There is then a buzzing sound. Police tell us they heard pit bull owner, Jimmy Cruz tell his dog Wassa to &quot;sic&#039; em&quot;. Words Cruz says he never used. &quot;That&#039;s not what I said. Whoosit, whoosit. That is what I said.&quot; Cruz went on to explain he was saying who is it. Cruz tells NewsChannel 11 he had left the garage door open anticipating the arrival of a friend. &quot;Door open and when they were going outside I was like Wassa who is it who is it, thinking it was okay,&quot; Cruz said. Instead of the friend, it was a Lubbock Police officer. On the camera recording it sounds like Cruz said, &quot;Don&#039;t shot my dog. No.&quot; The officer said, &quot;He&#039;s trying to attack me.&quot; Cruz replied, &quot;Don&#039;t shot my dog, oh thought we were friends.&quot; The officer shot and injured the dog who is now recovering back at home. Cruz claims the officer never identified himself as police and says his dog did not bite the officer. &quot;He told me she had bit him, I asked him if I could see the bite mark and all he showed me was a paw print on his thigh. I knew right there and then when I saw it, it was not her paw print,&quot; Cruz said. Cruz got Wassa after a pole vaulting accident in Sundown, which left him in a wheel chair. He says, over the past three years he raised her to be a loving family dog. &quot;I have kids here at the house and she&#039;s not aggressive at all,&quot; Cruz added. Something Lubbock Police may argue differently. &quot;It was complete a misunderstanding and it should have been handled totally differently. That should have never happened,&quot; Cruz said.

Investigators say the shooting happened after a police officer responded to a disturbance. The officer drew her weapon to fire at a dog, but accidentally shot a woman standing nearby. The shooting happened just after 7pm yesterday near 5th Avenue and Walnut Street. &quot;We were devastated,&quot; said Leon Filidei, whose 23-year-old daughter, Candice, was shot. &quot;I thought she had died.&quot; Filidei is counting his blessings. Candice is coming home from the hospital the day after the officer opened fire, injuring her. &quot;She had a bullet fragment ricochet off the ground or something and struck her in the collarbone,&quot; said Filidei. Candice was taken to Memorial Hermann Hospital by Life Flight. Her mother, Robin, was standing nearby and saw her daughter hit the ground. &quot;I don&#039;t know why it wasn&#039;t me shot,&quot; she said. The La Marque police officer was in the neighborhood on an unrelated call. As she was leaving, something stopped her. &quot;One of the girls screamed and the officer jumped out of the car, they told me, with a pistol and tried to shoot the dog,&quot; said Filidei. It was a neighbor&#039;s pit bull jumping and playing with a group of neighbors, including Gary Ennis&#039; teenagers. &quot;&#039;Boom,&#039; then my kids started running, then &#039;boom, boom&#039;,&quot; he said. Ennis heard five shots. Fourteen-year-old Miranda and 17-year-old Tommy were about six feet away from the whizzing bullets. &quot;I was so amazed that she was pointing her gun straight at me,&quot; said Tommy Ennis. &quot;The dog was running in and out of our legs and jumping on us and she&#039;s just shooting at it,&quot; added Miranda. We tried to talk to the dog&#039;s owner, but no one was home. When asked about the officer&#039;s actions, interim Police Chief Lt. Kirk Jackson explained the department&#039;s policy, saying, &quot;If the officer determines a threat to life or safety, they can use deadly force for the protection of citizens. It&#039;s no different in cases of aggressive animals.&quot; While Robin, Candice&#039;s mother, calls the incident a mistake, she says the officer had no right to shoot in close range with so many people nearby. &quot;She made a mistake,&quot; she said. &quot;She has to live with that. Thank God she kill anybody.&quot; Candice will not undergo surgery. The shrapnel will stay in her body. The Galveston County District Attorney&#039;s Office is investigating. The family says they haven&#039;t decided whether or not they&#039;ll take legal action. The police officer&#039;s name has not been released, but we&#039;re told she is a 30-year-old who has been on the force since March 2008. She is on administrative duty, which is standard procedure.

ALTERNATE COVERAGE from KENS5: A La Marque woman is recovering after being shot by a La Marque police officer Wednesday night. It happened as the officer attempted to shoot a dog she thought was attacking people, police said. Interim Police Chief Kirk Jackson said Officer Sabrina Sanders was responding to a call of shots fired about 7:15 p.m. when she reported seeing a dog attack three people in the 2300 block of 5th Avenue. Officer Sanders pulled her pistol and shot at the dog, said Jackson. He said a 23-year-old woman who was near the animal was hit by a bullet fragment or concrete. &quot;We were literally dodging bullets,&quot; said the shooting victim&#039;s mother, Robin Filidei. &quot;My daughter is fired at and scared. She gets shots and I can&#039;t help her. After a couple of shots, my daughter is laying on the ground.&quot; The injured woman was hit in the collar bone. She was taken to Memorial Hermann Hospital in Houston, and officials said she&#039;s expected to be OK. Another fragment hit the pit bull, say police. It too will be alright. The dog owner&#039;s brother, Dennis Wallace, said the dog wasn&#039;t attacking anyone at all.? &quot;Basically there was a little girl, or a young lady, playing with the dog in the front yard. She does get excited sometimes, so she will knock you down.? The young lady started hollering and just at that time, a police officer was coming down the road and thought the dog was attacking the lady,&quot; Wallace said. Neighbors in the area say they have never liked the dog. 11 News: &quot;What&#039;s going to happen the next time the dog gets on your property?&quot; Neighbor who wants to be anonymous: &quot;That dog is going to be dead.?

The officer has been put on administrative leave. FINAL COVERAGE in The Examiner, Breck Porter, December 2009 A Galveston County Grand Jury took &quot;No Action&quot; Tuesday in the case of La Marque policewoman Sabrina Sanders who shot at a dog resulting in schrapnel from the bullet accidently hitting a woman standing nearby after it ricocheted off the roadway. In October, the officer responded to a call of shots being fired in the 2300 block of 5th Street and arrived to find a Pit Bulldog attacking people. Candice Hughes who was hit was taken to a Houston hospital where she was treated and released. Investigators reported when Sanders shot at the dog, the bullet went through the dog&#039;s leg, hit the pavement and the schrapnel struck Hughes in the chest. Galveston County District Attorney Kurt Sistrunk said Tuesday as a matter of routine his office presents all officer involved shootings to a grand jury which results in any type of injury to anyone. &quot;We directed the investigation along with the Galveston County Sheriff&#039;s Office,&quot; Sistrunk said. &quot;The Grand Jury took &#039;No Action&#039;, finding the officer&#039;s actions in shooting the dog to protect others was not a criminal offense,&quot; said Sistrunk. Now Sanders, although cleared by the criminal justice system must undergo another review by the City of La Marque to determine if there were any violations of department policy or procedure. That review will also determine whether or not she will be returned to her duties as a patrol officer. Sanders has been on administrative duty since the October incident. http://www.examiner.com/article/grand-jury-takes-no-action-shooting-by-texas-officer NOT MENTIONED IN REPORT: PuppycideDB has confirmed that Sabrina Sanders was still an employee of Le Marque Police Department as of February 21, 2013, when she completed a racial profiling course with the department.','https://web.archive.org/web/20150117165907/http://abc13.com/archive/7054056/','Unknown','Sabrina Sanders','0','1',1,0,1,0,2,'Uniform',2,2,1,0,2,0),(1457,'2014-07-22','New Jersey','Bloomfield','Clifton Police Department, Clifton Animal Control',1,2,1,'Unconfirmed','A Clifton Police detective accidentally shot himself after a pit-bull charged at him in the Township of Bloomfield.

In Friday&#039;s incident, county sheriff&#039;s department spokesman Les Garcia told KCRA 3 the dog in question acted alone in going after the chickens. The birds&#039; owner shot at the dog, but wasn&#039;t sure if he aimed correctly. He then called for law enforcement. Deputies first tried to tranquilize the dog, but the measure proved to be ineffective, Garcia said. People were nearby, and officials considered the dog a danger, which justified its killing, according to investigators. Again, it&#039;s not clear if this is one of the dogs sought Wednesday and Thursday in the French Camp area. Deputies there have been on the hunt for a pack of wild dogs, likely 10 of them, Garcia has said. Armed with traps and tranquilizers, officials searched for the animals several days this week. The hunt has continued on four-wheelers, through orchards and other places the dogs are thought to be resting. The 10 dogs are pit bull, German shepherd and coyote mixes, Garcia added. Another canine that came into contact with deputies was shot dead earlier in the week. One San Joaquin County man lost about 160 goats to the wild dogs. Eighty were attacked and killed by the pack, and the rest of the goats had to be euthanized. He said the financial loss is about $35,000. The goats were going to be auctioned on Saturday.

Two undercover officers, who were identified only as police gang unit personnel, on Wednes day afternoon went to a house in the 3500 block of Hixson, where they were investigating graffiti that occurred in the area during the weekend, police said. Outside the house, the officers saw a person matching the description of a suspect they were seeking, and he ran toward the backyard, police spokesman Javier Sambrano said. &quot;Officers gave chase. As that was happening, one of the dogs (in back of the house) began to attack one of the officers,&quot; he said. &quot;An assisting officer pushed that dog away. When he did that, another dog bit that officer on his leg.&quot; Sambrano said the dog bit the officer a second time and caused him to fall. &quot;The dog was heading to attack the officer again, at which time he discharged his firearm, killing the dog,&quot; he said. The officer was taken to Thomason Hospital and was not thought to be in serious condition, Sambrano said. &quot;They killed our dog, and they had no business going to the backyard,&quot; said David Egure, the owner of the house. &quot;As you could see right here (on the left side of the house), that&#039;s where they tackled (his son) and we don&#039;t have any dogs here. Why did they go to the backyard and shoot our dog?&quot; Egure, who owns three pit bulls, said the officers were chasing his 15-year-old son, David Joseph Morales, and tackled him near the left side of the house. The dog that was shot was 5 years old, Egure said. An adult pit bull can weigh up to 90 pounds. His son was outside when he saw the officers and started to run, Egure said. &quot;My son must have gotten scared of the police officers because they were bold. He thought they were gang members,&quot; he said. &quot;In the past, we have been assaulted by gangs, so we are always ready. We&#039;ve been shot at in this house before.&quot; The incident could have been prevented, Egure said, if the officers had been in uniform and knocked on the front door. &quot;It is not right. They made a big raid, like if we had drugs. It is not right for them to come and scare off the people and shoot the dogs,&quot; he said. He added that all the dogs were fenced inside the backyard. Morales was arrested for allegedly evading arrest and was turned over to juvenile authorities. His uncle, Billy Egure, who also lives at that home, was arrested for outstanding traffic warrants. Any dog, whether a pit bull or other type, will protect its owner and property, said Martha Williams, president and director of Pet Guardian Angel Welfare Inc. The organization rescues dogs and offers them for adoption. She said that not all pit bulls were vicious, but that their bites could be &quot;real painful.&quot; &quot;Where was his Taser gun?&quot; she said. &quot;This is happening with great frequency. &Eacute; When they are shooting a dog like that, bullets can ricochet.&quot; In 2007, three dogs were shot and killed by El Paso police officers, according to El Paso Times archives.

A driver saw Tanner Joshua Monk lying beside a road near Breckenridge on Sunday with two dogs nearby, Stephens County Sheriff Jim Reeves said. She got out of the car to help him, but the dogs became aggressive so she called 911, he said. Two sheriff&#039;s deputies who came to the scene shot the dogs to death when they also became aggressive toward them. The deputies then found that Tanner was dead, Reeves said in Monday&#039;s edition of the Abilene Reporter-News. Tanner was found alone about 150 yards from his house and 50 to 75 yards from a neighbor&#039;s house where he had been playing with some friends, Reeves told The Associated Press on Monday. The two pit bulls, along with two others seized at the scene by law enforcement, belonged to those neighbors, Reeves said. No one was arrested Sunday. Reeves said evidence probably will be presented to a grand jury following an autopsy on the boy and tests on the dogs that were killed. Apparently no one saw what happened on the road north of Breckenridge, about 125 miles west of Dallas, he said. Child Protective Services is investigating the boy&#039;s family for possible neglectful supervision, spokesman Paul Zimmerman said Monday. He said the family had no prior history with the agency, which is required to investigate child deaths. It was the second serious pit bull attack on a child in four days in Texas.

The front door was slightly ajar, and deputies saw the suspect, Michael Perry Jackson, run upstairs, Keith said. Jackson jumped from a second-story window into the backyard, where deputies were posted as standard procedure dictates, Keith said. Deputies tried to arrest Jackson, who fought back, Keith said. Deputies deployed a stun gun, but Jackson continued fighting, Keith said. The struggle attracted a crowd of witnesses. One neighbor released Gangster and told the dog to attack the deputies, Keith said. One of the deputies pulled a gun and fired one shot, killing the dog, which Keith said was &ldquo;large.&rdquo; Deputies managed to subdue Jackson and serve the burglary warrant.

The pit bull&#039;s owner was charged with allowing a dog to run at large and failure to comply with the rabies vaccination law, Cauley said. Grifton Police officer James Andrews shot the dog after he said it charged toward him and grabbed his pant leg with its teeth while he was outside the dog owner&#039;s home.

The call came in at about 2:30 p.m. Barrow was taken to Pitt County Memorial Hospital with injuries to her leg. The police officer was not injured.

Griffin filed a lawsuit against the City of Hickory Hills and Bajt; the case went to jury and Griffin lost. This was neither the first nor last serious allegation of violence made against Bajt. Bajt was one of the named defendants of SLOAN v. VILLAGE OF HICKORY HILLS, a lawsuit in which it was alleged that Ryan Bajt and his partner Joseph Roscetti severly beat an unarmed man, causing permanent injury Case No. 07 CV 7038, Decided August 27, 2008 . The court again sided with Bajt and dismissed the claims of excessive force pending against him. From the Chicago Tribune:  A Chicago jury earlier this month delivered a verdict favoring the City of Hickory Hills police officer who fatally shot a Rottweiler/Bull Mastiff mix during their hunt for a narcotics suspect in 2005. In a relatively rare type of constitutional law and civil rights trial about a dog shooting by suburban police held in Chicagos Cook County Circuit Court, the jury found that Hickory Hills Officer Ryan Bajt acted reasonably when he shot and killed the dog. The dog&rsquo;s owner, John Griffin formerly of Midlothian, Illinois, sued the suburb of City of Hickory Hills and the officer in 2006 claiming his constitutional rights were violated. Courts have held that unnecessarily killing a pet violates the owner&rsquo;s Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable seizure. Griffin was seeking compensatory damages and money damages for intentional infliction of emotional distress for his son JT, a minor, who alleged to have witnessed the shooting from 15 feet away in the backyard. The jury found all the defendants not guilty of any reckless and intentional conduct alleged regarding the claim of the childs emotional distress. The police had arrested the narcotic suspects wife in the late morning after a cocaine buy and she told them that her husband was at the Griffin home in Midlothian. The officers went to that address based on that information. Officers were given consent to search the Griffin home for the suspect. Once the consent was obtained, Officer Bajt was establishing a rear perimeter in the back yard of the home should the felon suspect attempt to flee out the back. Another officer, a detective, noticed the dog outside the home on a raised wooden deck who within just a couple seconds ran around the corner of the house where Bajt was posted and clearing toward the perimeter in the backyard. This is where officers&rsquo; and witnesses&rsquo; accounts diverged. Bajt said the dog charged at him in a very aggressive manner and did not stop his attack as Bajt told the dog to sit and bad dog. A kick at the dog by the officer also failed to stop the dogs charge and Bajt ended the threat by firing a single bullet in the crown of the dogs head. The young boy said he saw the dog sniffing at the officers shoes just an instant before he witnessed the gunshot to the pets head. The boys mother also testified that her son was in the backyard playing with the dog at the time she heard something she later understood was the gunshot. She said she then saw the boy run into the house from the backyard. &ldquo;I thought I was about to get injured,&rdquo; said Bajt, about the speed at which the dog was approaching. The Citys trial attorney Alan J. Brinkmeier said that the jury verdict that no unreasonable Fourth Amendment search and seizure supported the good police work that had been done in the case. Im pleased the jury saw this as a justified action made as a split-second decision by Officer Bajt to protect himself against imminent harm. The Hickory Hills police went to Griffin&rsquo;s Midlothian home on an August evening looking for a man suspected of selling narcotics. An informant, the suspects wife told police the man was likely in Griffin&rsquo;s house. As two officers were given permission to search for the suspect in the home, Bajt jumped a backyard fence to establish a rear perimeter. A third detective was on the other side of the house when he observed the dog on the back porch. That is when seconds later the dog ran off the porch and appeared to Officer Bajt out of no where, ran toward him, and lunged a couple times at Bajt according to testimony. Bajt shot the dog once with his duty weapon. In his closing argument the attorney for the plaintiffs, who asked the jury to return verdicts well into six figures, said the officer could have taken other steps short of killing the dog, such as pepper spray or mace. Brinkmeier, with the Chicago firm of Merlo Kanofsky Brinkmeier &amp; Gregg, Ltd., argued in the closing argument that the evidence had been that other efforts to stop the dog, such as the two verbal commands to get the dog to stop and the attempt to kick the dog to chase it back were sufficient non-lethal efforts by the officer who then had to use deadly force as a last resort. The jury agreed. The only damages the jury did award in the case was $7,000.00 on a state law conversion claim, in which the jury awarded the owner the value of the pet and reasonably related expenses for the dogs care and upkeep over the time of ownership. Police did not find the suspect at the house but the suspect was arrested the next day and is still serving time on felony conviction for the sale of illegal narcotics. ALTERNATE COVERAGE Chicago Times July 27, 2006 By Lolly Bowean http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2006-07-27/news/0607270283_1_dead-dog-dog-and-shot-guard-dog - For six years, John Griffin raised his son and his pet bullmastiff Hooch side-by-side in his Midlothian home. But their happy life was violently disrupted last year when a Hickory Hills police officer allegedly shot and killed the dog in front of the boy in the family&#039;s back yard, Griffin said. &quot;It was like losing one of my children,&quot; he said. &quot;I raised him from a pup. He went on vacation with us, slept with the kids at night. He was the all-around family dog.&quot; Griffin filed suit Tuesday in Cook County Circuit Court against Hickory Hills police, alleging his 6-year-old son suffered emotional distress because of the shooting. He is seeking compensation of more than $30,000 for the cost of the dog, bills incurred by the boy&#039;s subsequent professional counseling and for emotional distress. &quot;The kid was definitely traumatized by this,&quot; attorney Jerome F. Marconi said. &quot;His parents don&#039;t have health insurance, and every time he goes to the therapist it&#039;s $150. Sometimes it was hard keeping him in [therapy] just because of the money situation.&quot; Hickory Hills police officials declined to comment, saying they had not seen the lawsuit. According to the suit, police showed up at Griffin&#039;s home on Aug. 4, searching for a man who might have been there for a barbecue the day before, Marconi said. Griffin said the man was wanted on narcotics charges. Griffin said he willingly let the police search his home and sent the dog and his two children out to play in the yard. At some point, an officer climbed over the family&#039;s 6-foot-high fence, came upon the dog and shot it in the face, Marconi said. The officer went into the yard despite posted signs that said &quot;No Trespassing Private Property&quot; and &quot;Guard Dog on Duty,&quot; Marconi said. &quot;It&#039;s hard to say what happened because you are getting it from a 6-year-old,&quot; he said. &quot;But we know he shot the dog between the eyes. The kid got pretty freaked about it.&quot; After the shooting, the boy started having nightmares, Griffin said. He insisted on moving and to appease him, the family moved to Chicago. Since then, the boy has been in therapy. &quot;My son was scared to play in the yard,&quot; Griffin said. &quot;He was afraid the police would come and shoot him.&quot; Griffin&#039;s 2-year-old daughter also was in the yard but did not see the shooting, Marconi said. A full-grown bullmastiff typically can weigh up to 130 pounds. Hooch was protective of the children but not vicious, Griffin said. &quot;He&#039;d never attacked anyone before,&quot; he said. &quot;Naturally the dog is going to approach if you enter the yard. That officer had no right to be back there.&quot; Though the incident happened last year, the family waited to see how the boy would progress in therapy before filing suit, Marconi said. The lawsuit alleges police acted unlawfully by searching Griffin&#039;s yard without probable cause or consent and showed poor conduct when they ignored the signs Griffin had posted on his fence. It also alleges the officer intentionally inflicted emotional distress on the children when he shot the dog. &quot;It was a stupid thing,&quot; Marconi said. &quot;The police officers were in--all they had to do is communicate.&quot;','http://www.triblocal.com/hinsdale/community/stories/2009/02/dog-owner-loses-civil-rights-lawsuit-in-police-shooting-of-dog/','Hooch','Ryan Bajt - shooter, unknown detectives','2','0',1,0,0,0,2,'Uniform',2,1,0,0,1,0),(1472,'2008-09-28','Texas','Anson','Anson Police Department',2,2,1,'one dog, one goat','From Abilene Reporter-News: Anson city officials say a national animal rights group is out of line after accusing the city of questionable policies and procedures at the city&#039;s animal shelter. The issue came up after a witness allegedly saw a city employee shoot a dog and contacted People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. City officials defended the Sept. 28 incident, saying that the dog in question, a pit bull who had escaped from a pen, was attacking a baby goat and even had endangered a city police officer&#039;s life before it was shot. Anson Police Chief Patrick Hawthorne said that before the incident the city had impounded three goats, one of which was a baby. &quot;We had put the goats in an outside holding cell, not with the dogs,&quot; Hawthorne said. &quot;We had also impounded a pit bull at around the same time.&quot; He said the officer received a call that the pit bull had escaped from the pen. When the officer arrived, Hawthorne said, he found the pit bull attacking the baby goat -- the leg was severed and the goat was bleeding profusely. &quot;At that point the officer determined he was dealing with an aggressive dog -- he put his own life in danger,&quot; Hawthorne said. &quot;So he made the decision to shoot the dog.&quot; He said the dog died instantly and was properly bagged and disposed of in accordance with state law. &quot;When you see a dog attacking livestock, it is legal under state law to shoot the dog,&quot; Hawthorne said. Hawthorne declined to name the officer, but noted that he was a certified dog handler. City Manager Dowell Matthews, who arrived on the scene after the animal was shot, said the officer was pale and shaken. &quot;He said, &#039;Boss, I&#039;m sorry, but I had no choice,&#039;&quot; Matthews said. Both officials commended the officer&#039;s actions, saying that the pit bull could have posed a threat to children at a nearby soccer field or other residents. It is still a mystery as to how the pit bull escaped from the pen, they said. In a letter to Anson Mayor Vance Boyd dated Oct. 9, Teresa Chagrin, PETA animal care and control specialist with the cruelty investigations department, claimed that neither Matthews or Hawthorne would discuss the matter with her. Both said they talked to her, but they added that PETA did not appear to be interested in the truth. Matthews said residents have been making signs that read &quot;What about the goat?&quot; The baby goat, which was severely injured, was euthanized by injection, Hawthorne said. The officials said that as a result of the letter, which is linked on PETA&#039;s Web site, they have received more than 500 threatening e-mails from people all over the country. &quot;All of the people are basing their allegations on what PETA has said, which is an extremist organization,&quot; Hawthorne said. &quot;It put some fear in the community that these extremists may show up and cause some harm.&quot; The PETA letter also addressed the recent finding of a dead puppy in the shelter. Hawthorne said the puppy appeared to be fine at 4:30 p.m. one evening and the next day it was found dead in the pen. &quot;It was not decomposing,&quot; he said. The Anson animal shelter can house up to 12 dogs. Dogs may be impounded for up to 72 hours before they are euthanized by injection, Hawthorne said. If possible, dogs are kept up to six days. Sometimes dogs are taken to the shelter in Abilene. &quot;We try to find homes for them and adopt them out,&quot; Hawthorne said. &quot;Our officers clean the pens and feed and water the dogs every day.&quot; Both Matthews and Hawthorne said Anson is no different from other small communities that are dealing with an onslaught of stray animals. &quot;We are just like other communities dealing with this problem,&quot; Matthews said.

City officials have declined to comment on the issue. An official from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals said Anson-area residents notified the group about questionable policies and procedures at the Anson animal shelter. Some claim to be eyewitnesses to a recent incident in which a dog at the shelter allegedly was fatally shot, said Teresa Lynn Chagrin, PETA animal care and control specialist with the cruelty investigations department. The shooting allegedly occurred Sept. 28 at the shelter, according to a witness who wrote PETA about the incident. The witness, who declined to be named, said she &quot;saw a man holding a large gun that was pointed at a brown dog. By the time I brought my mother&#039;s attention to what was going on, it was too late; the man had shot the dog.&quot; Chagrin said she called Anson Police Chief Patrick Hawthorne and City Manager Dowell Matthews about the matter, but both refused to speak with her. &quot;I have been doing animal protection work for decades, and I have never been treated so unprofessionally by public officials,&quot; she wrote to Anson city officials. &quot;There is no excuse for these officials&#039; behavior -- especially if they have nothing to hide. The suspicious behavior of the town officials who oversee the Anson Animal Shelter suggests that there might be substance to the claims that a friendly dog -- who was not posing an imminent danger to anyone and whose tail was reportedly wagging -- was violently shot to death.&quot; Matthews has not responded to e-mailed questions or phone calls from local media. Mayor Vance Boyd declined to talk about the city shelter. When asked about PETA&#039;s concerns, Hawthorne would only say in an e-mail: &quot;I consider PETA a terrorist organization. I don&#039;t deal with terrorists.&quot; PETA said it has received complaints about a puppy that allegedly died at the animal shelter Sept. 17. According to complainants, the puppy&#039;s body was left in the kennel for two days. There also have been complaints filed with PETA stating that animals in the shelter are denied access to drinking water, food and clean, healthy housing. PETA also received complaints regarding a puppy that was run over Friday. &quot;The animal control officer refused to even tell if the puppy had been picked up or not,&quot; Chagrin said. This complaint, along with the letter sent to the city by PETA, was posted on the organization&#039;s Web site, www.peta.org. The group is urging people to contact the mayor. Chagrin said PETA wants to assist city officials in examining its policies and procedures at the animal shelter. Anson has about 2,500 residents. Last month, PETA sent a letter to Rising Star city officials after complaints were raised about conditions at its animal shelter, including dogs confined in dilapidated and fly-infested outdoor pens without access to clean drinking water. The city&#039;s mayor defended the shelter, saying it might not be the best, but animals are given fresh food and water daily.','http://www.reporternews.com/news/big-country/anson-officials-refute-cruelty-allegations','Unknown','City Manager Dowell Matthews, unidentified police officer,','1','0',0,0,0,3,3,'Uniform',1,2,0,0,2,0),(1473,'2008-08-08','Texas','Amarillo','Amarillo Police Department',1,2,1,'Unconfirmed','From the Amarillo Globe-News: An Amarillo police officer shot a dog Friday while responding to an alarm call.

Osborne said he thinks he was acting in good faith under a city ordinance that reads, &ldquo;The pound officer, a police officer, or such other officer or employee of the city ... may authorize, shall take into custody and impound any animal running at large in violation of any provision of the ordinances of the city, may enter upon the premises of the owner or other private premises to take such animal into custody, and, if with reasonable effort a dog or cat illegally at large cannot be caught, may kill it, either on or off private premises.&rdquo; In the arrest warrant, Texas County Deputy Matt Boley said he went to the scene and had the incident explained to him in detail using some reference points on the golf course. Osborne told Boley only open land lies beyond where the dogs were shot and he did not think there was any evidence to support the accusation that he shot toward the Hooker Public School in a reckless manner. &ldquo;Throughout this investigation there has been a common opinion voiced from most of the individuals I have interviewed and that is &lsquo;It could have been handled differently&rsquo;,&rdquo; Boley said in an affidavit. &ldquo;There is no doubt Osborne&rsquo;s actions have disrupted the community, causing outrage for those that were caring for the dogs and sadness for others in the way the situation was handled.&rdquo; Osborne was arrested Friday and released after he posted cash bond of $2,500.','http://amarillo.com/oklahoma/2013-03-12/hooker-okla-city-leader-faces-charges-shooting-dogs','Birddog and Speckie','Hooker City Superintendent Forest Frosty Osborne','2','0',2,0,0,3,3,'Plain Clothes',2,3,0,0,0,1),(1475,'2006-07-31','Texas','Amarillo','Amarillo Police Department',1,2,0,'Unconfirmed','A bullet that went through a South Alabama Street resident&#039;s front window July 31 was in fact fired by a police officer. According to reports, officers originally responded to the area on a loud party complaint on the morning of July 31, and were leaving when a pit bull approached and attacked the two officers. Reports say both officers drew their weapons and one officer fired at the dog. The officers reported that the dog did not stop and that they were required to fire at the dog repeatedly until it turned and ran. Despiny Solis, a visitor at the home, said earlier this month that she was only feet from the window, but didn&#039;t notice the bullet hole until after the shooting stopped. Solis said the officers shot five or six times at the pit bull, and then when officers checked the bullet - found still warm in the home - they denied it came from one of their guns. She said they took the bullet for further investigation. Karla Delisoe, who lives next door, said she was a witness too. &quot;They were shooting like crazy at that dog,&quot; said Delisoe, noting, &quot;Someone could have easily got killed that night.&quot; According to Sgt. Berry Carden, investigator with the Amarillo Police Department&#039;s internal affairs division, the bullet in question was mushroomed, meaning that it traveled through soft tissue. He said the bullet more than likely first traveled through the dog. Carden also said the bullet was shaved on one side, indicating that it hit asphalt or concrete. The internal affairs division has concluded that the bullet first struck the dog before hitting the street or a sidewalk, causing the bullet&#039;s trajectory to change and travel through the window. Carden said the dog was shot five times. Carden said the investigation is complete, but results still have to go before the department&#039;s shooting review board - which will meet Aug. 24 - before a final decision is made on the incident. The police department requested that the Department of Public Safety perform a ballistics test on the bullet, but the request was denied because there were no criminal charges pending, according to the police department. As for replacing the broken window, Carden said the responsibility lies with the pet owner because the dog was unrestrained. &quot;Nobody has been brave enough to claim the animal,&quot; Carden added. Carden said he has filed paperwork with the city&#039;s risk management department to help the residents get the window fixed. Jim Smith, claims administrator for the city of Amarillo, said the best thing for residents to do in this type of situation is contact the city&#039;s risk management department about the incident. He said the department has the resident write up what happened and what the damage was. After comparing the claim against police reports or other documentation, Smith said he will then make a decision on the case.','http://amarillo.com/stories/081806/new_5368327.shtml','Unknown','Unknown','1','0',2,0,0,3,3,'Uniform',0,3,2,0,0,0),(1476,'1998-03-10','Texas','Amarillo','Amarillo Police Department, Potter County Sheriffs Office',1,2,0,'Unconfirmed','From Amarillo Globe-News - A car chase spanning two counties in heavy fog ended with a suspect under arrest and an Amarillo police officer injured by gunfire early Saturday morning. Officer Richard Anderson accidentally shot himself in the knee as he tried to ward off an aggressive dog, according to an Amarillo Police Department news release. Around 6:45 a.m. Saturday, Anderson and fellow APD officer Darryl Wertz began following a speeding 1991 Pontiac Firebird on East Interstate 40, according to the release. The driver of the Firebird, Ricky Dee Collins, 42, was traveling up to 100 mph when the officers pulled in behind him, the release stated. A unit from the Potter County Sheriff&#039;s Office took over the chase at the city limits as Anderson and Wertz stayed in as a backup unit. The pursuit continued into Carson County, where Anderson and Wertz temporarily lost the chase in the fog, then met up with the Potter County deputy after Collins got his Firebird stuck in a grassy median, according to the release. Anderson said he and the deputy began handcuffing the suspect, and at that moment, a dog that apparently belonged to the suspect charged Anderson. He then drew his weapon, backed up and tried to fire at the dog, he said. Anderson then lost his footing on the wet grass and accidentally fired one round into his knee from his .45-caliber revolver. Anderson underwent surgery at a local hospital, where he was listed in good condition Monday. Col. Robert Francis, assistant chief of police, said Anderson&#039;s kneecap did not have to be removed during surgery and was rebuilt. Anderson said from his hospital bed late Monday that he&#039;s not sure when he&#039;ll get to go home. Collins was booked into the Carson County Jail, where he was arraigned on two counts of evading arrest in Potter County and one count of evading arrest in Carson County.','http://amarillo.com/stories/031098/021-7152.002.shtml','Unknown','Richard Anderson - shooter, Darryl Wertz','1','2',0,0,1,1,1,'Uniform',3,3,0,0,0,0),(1477,'2000-05-12','Texas','Amarillo','Amarillo Police Department, Amarillo Animal Management &amp; Welfare',1,50,0,'Belgian Malanois, 2yo police K9','From Amarillo Globe-News: An Amarillo police officer was attacked by his own police dog Friday and was forced to shoot the dog when it jumped at the officer&#039;s face, APD Col.

At just 25 pounds, the dog now named &quot;Taser&quot; doesn&#039;t look that intimidating. &quot;She&#039;s just a gentle little dog who&#039;s greatly traumatized,&quot; said Jane Brundage of Pets, Inc.  Brundage can&#039;t figure out why an Irmo police officer tased the dog twice on Thursday. &quot;We don&#039;t know the whole story on this, but we were surprised to see this happen,&quot; Brundage said. Irmo police say Animal Control was responding to a complaint that two dogs were chasing people on Milway Road. A report says the Animal Control worker hit one with a tranquilizer dart, but he didn&#039;t have a dart for the other dog, so he called Irmo police to help round it up. &quot;I think he made a good decision,&quot; said Irmo police chief Brian Buck says the two men corralled the dog into a backyard. &quot;The dog came after him in an aggressive manner, was going to bite him, and so he elected to use the least amount of force he had to stop that attack from happening,&quot; said Buck. The report says the dog tried attacking a second time, and again got tased. This time it broke the leads and ran away. It showed up later a few blocks away. &quot;These were still in  her, and it came with like 15 feet of this coil,&quot; said Brundage. Pets Inc. says a vet had to surgically remove the Taser leads. &quot;It would seem to us to be prudent to use a catch pole on a dog like that as opposed to firing a Taser into her,&quot; Brundage said. Buck says they used the Taser only after the catch pole failed. &quot;We think the officer did the best he could under the circumstances to protect both the community first and then the animal second,&quot; said Buck. Chief Buck says there was added urgency because kids were getting off a school bus nearby. The owner of the dogs has been cited for animals running at large.

Wilkes-Barre police shot and killed a pit bull Sunday night after the dogs attacked another dog and some bystanders trying to break up the fight. The incident occurred around 9:30 p.m. on East Northampton Street. According to police: Officers on patrol encountered two pit bulls mauling another dog and two people attempting to separate the animals. Police determined the dogs could not be separated, and that the pit bulls were causing serious harm to the other dog. Police fired their weapons, striking one or both of the pit bulls, effectively ending the attack. Both dogs ran away. One returned to its home and the other dog fled to a nearby property. Police caught up with the second pit bull and determined it had to be euthanized. They shot the dog again, and it charged at the officers. The dog then returned to its yard, and police shot it a third time, fatally wounding the animal. The incident is still under investigation, and police said the pit bull owners will face charges.

According to the police report, officers received reports of a pit bull roaming unleashed in the area of South River and Market streets around 5:18 p.m. Officers responded to the area and were unable to gain control of the physically aggressive dog or locate its owner. Officers followed the dog to the rear of the American Legion at 45 N. River St., where the dog charged at Patrolman Joe Mangan. Mangan fired at the dog, killing it, to protect himself, the other officers on the scene, and people in the area of the River Common. Saturday&#039;s incident is the second dog attack reported at the River Common in the past week. On Monday, a man&#039;s leashed dog was attacked by two loose dogs near South River and West Northampton streets. His dog was injured so severely it had to be euthanized. On Thursday, Leighton announced the city is seeking help from state legislators to protect residents and their pets from vicious dog breeds in public areas. State law currently prevents municipalities from enacting laws that single out dogs based solely on breed. City Administrator J.J. Murphy said he couldn&#039;t comment on Saturday&#039;s shooting until he reviewed the incident, except to say his comments made in support of the crackdown on vicious dog breeds in public areas stand true. &quot;We&#039;re trying to be proactive. With all due respect to all these dog-lovers who think (some breeds are) not a very vicious dog, I have to disagree,&quot; Murphy said last week. However, some animal advocates said last week legislators and municipal officials shouldn&#039;t ban specific breeds because each dog is unique. Cindy Stark, a member of the governor&#039;s Dog Law Advisory Board and shelter manager for the Luzerne County Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to animals, said laws to protecting the public from vicious breeds should be aimed at owners, not specific breeds.

He liked to jump on people, but playfully. &quot;He would growl because he wants to play, not because he wants to hurt anybody. He loved people. He was beautiful, beautiful,&quot; Nielene Bogansky, who raised him the past five years, said. After Syncere left his yard at 594 Hayes St. on Monday, Hazleton police shot and killed him. Bogansky, a retired teacher&#039;s aide, thinks police misread the dog&#039;s intentions, and Syncere paid a penalty because of his breed. &quot;He loves people and would never hurt anyone, but he happens to have the name pit bull,&quot; Bogansky said. Police, however, said they were called to Hayes and Seventh streets because the dog was snapping at the caller&#039;s husband. Syncere later showed its teeth and snarled and when commanded to &quot;go away&quot; lunged at the officer, who fired one shot as the 70-pound dog&#039;s head was between the pockets of his shirt. Sometime Thursday afternoon, Syncere left Bogansky&#039;s backyard. Although the backyard gate was shut when Bogansky checked at 3:30 p.m., she found the gate open afterwards. The gate swings in so Syncere couldn&#039;t have pushed open the gate. Bogansky thinks someone opened the gate. She blames children, whom a neighbor said were going through the area. A neighbor whose name Bogansky doesn&#039;t know recognized Syncere and walked the dog toward Bogansky&#039;s home without a leash while accompanied by police. When the police reached Bogansky&#039;s home, the dog came after one patrolman, who elected to stay on the sidewalk rather than encroach on the dog&#039;s territory. While two other officers went to the door, Syncere snapped at the legs of the patrolman on the sidewalk. The patrolman said he could feel the dog&#039;s breath through his trousers, Hazleton Police Chief Frank DeAndrea said after reviewing the officer&#039;s report. The officer said &quot;Enough. Go away.&quot; The dog seemed to turn away, briefly, but then lunged at the patrolman, who backed into the street. With the dog&#039;s snout on his shirt, the patrolman fired. Syncere&#039;s legs were stiff as if in an attack mode, and he was not wagging his tail, police said. Bogansky&#039;s doorbell doesn&#039;t work so she didn&#039;t know what was happening outside her house until she heard the shot. Through her window, she saw Syncere, bleeding. When Syncere was younger, the dog left four or five times when Bogansky&#039;s grandson forgot to close the gate. Bogansky reclaimed her dog from the Hazleton Animal Shelter in each of those cases. She said the dog hasn&#039;t been loose in at least two years - until Monday. DeAndrea said the dog was known to the workers at the animal shelter for aggression. Police are investigating whether violations of the state&#039;s dog laws were committed such as failure to keep the dog on a leash, renew the dog&#039;s license or vaccinate the dog. After Syncere was wounded, Bogansky didn&#039;t want to put the dog in her car. So police drove the dog to the animal shelter, where it died while police tried to arrange veterinary care. Bogansky said she will have Syncere cremated.','http://citizensvoice.com/news/hazleton-police-shoot-kill-pit-bull-1.1338887','Syncere','Unknown','1','0',2,0,0,2,2,'Uniform',3,2,2,2,2,2),(1504,'2014-05-17','Pennsylvania','Kingston','Kingston Police Department',1,2,1,'Unconfirmed','Kingston Borough police said they were justified in shooting and killing a wandering pit bull Sunday morning. Police said they received complaints on Saturday that a female pit bull was at large in the neighborhood, but they could not locate the dog until Sunday, as it was continuing to wander the area of Schuyler Avenue and John Street. Kingston Police Chief Michael Krzywicki said the officers&rsquo; main concern was that the dog would be at large again and could put people in harm&rsquo;s way. &ldquo;Did we want to take it down?&rdquo; Krzywicki said. &ldquo;No, we did not.&rdquo; Bill Stets, a resident on Schuyler Avenue who witnessed the shooting, said police came knocking on his door on Saturday trying to find the dog. Stets was sitting on his porch the following day when police spent about three hours attempting to snare the dog. &ldquo;(The dog) came out from behind the yard and was barking every time they went to snare it,&rdquo; Stets said. He said the dog would move forward, and the officers would step back. The dog became more aggressive when the officers tried cornering it and hooking it with the snare. This went on for hours, he said. &ldquo;(Police) were giving the dog a chance,&rdquo; Stets said. &ldquo;They did all they could.&rdquo; Police had been trying to snare the dog for about three hours before an officer used a rifle to shoot the dog, Krzywicki said. Officers followed the proper procedures in place, Krzywicki said. He also said before the shooting, officers couldn&rsquo;t reach the county&rsquo;s dog warden, Jim Spencer, as he was on vacation, and attempts to contact the county&rsquo;s SPCA were unsuccessful. Employees at the SPCA said it is open seven days a week, and they have no records of police trying to contact them. Krzywicki, a canine handler for the department for 14 years, said he then gave his officers permission to shoot the dog, and it wasn&rsquo;t a decision they acted on by themselves.

Officer Marco DeCamillo fired three times at the dog after it jumped in front of him and charged him while snarling and bearing its teeth, borough police said. The pit bull was about three feet from DeCamillo when he fired at the animal, police said. DeCamillo was not injured. Another pit bull that was in the area ran off, but was captured a short time later without incident in the 200 block of Chestnut Street in West Reading, police said. Neither dog had a collar, said Harry D. Brown III, executive director of the Animal Rescue League, Cumru Township. DeCamillo was on foot patrol at the Bertolet Fishing Pier shortly before 2 when the dog jumped off a 15-foot-high concrete embankment, borough police Chief Edward C. Fabriziani said. The pier is at the foot of South First Street near the Reading Area Community College bridge. DeCamillo was patrolling the area because of an ongoing problem with graffiti, Fabriziani said. Fearing for his safety, the officer shot the dog three times, Fabriziani said. &quot;If a dog acts aggressively, and threatens an officer, it needs to be put down,&quot; the chief said. The pier is a popular fishing and hiking destination. However, no one else was in the area when the attack occurred, Fabriziani said. &quot;During the day, we have kids and adults down here fishing,&quot; he said. It was not clear if the dogs had escaped from their owners or had been abandoned in the area, Brown said. The pier is in a remote location, so it&#039;s possible the dogs had been left there, he said. The dogs apparently had not spent much time on their own, Brown said. &quot;They didn&#039;t look like too undernourished,&quot; he said. Dogs that are abandoned have a tendency to stay in the area where their owners left them, Brown said. The behavior of the two pit bulls suggests they were defending their turf, he said. Animal Rescue League staff have seen an upswing in the number of stray and abandoned dogs in Berks County in the past few months, Brown said. Normally, he said, staff members pick up five dogs on a busy day. Now, they are taking between five and 10 dogs a day, Brown said. In March, the Animal Rescue League took over dog enforcement duties for Reading, replacing the Humane Society of Berks County Inc. On Tuesday, Rescue League staff picked up 22 strays around Berks, Brown said. &quot;That was an exceptional day,&quot; he said. &quot;It has been a steady increase.&quot; Brown said he believes the upswing in abandoned dogs is a result of the poor economy. People are dumping dogs they can no longer afford to feed or care for, he said. Abandoning animals does not have to be a last resort, Brown said. The Rescue League will take in animals that people can&#039;t afford, he said.','http://www2.readingeagle.com/article.aspx?id=107980','Unknown','Marco DeCamillo','1','0',2,0,0,2,2,'Uniform',3,3,0,0,0,0),(1506,'2007-07-21','Pennsylvania','Reading','Reading Police Department, Humane Society of Berks County Inc',1,2,1,'Unconfirmed','From the Reading Eagle: Reading police shot and killed a pit bull terrier Friday after it got loose and bit a man mowing his mother&rsquo;s lawn and a police officer, officials said.

Authorities said that zoo staff and then police responded &quot;within minutes,&quot; but visitors described that time as being filled with screams for help. Zookeepers called off some of the dogs, and seven of them immediately went to a back building. Three more eventually were drawn away from the child, but the last dog was aggressive and police had to shoot the animal. Steve Feldman, a spokesman for the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, said no one he&#039;s spoken to can recall any deaths of children at an accredited zoo over the last 40 years or more. Feldman said the Pittsburgh Zoo successfully completed its 5-year review in September, which means it meets or exceeds all safety standards. Authorities didn&#039;t release the name of the woman, but say she is 34 years old and lives in Pleasant Hills, just outside Pittsburgh. The boy&#039;s father arrived on the scene soon after the accident, police said. The zoo was immediately closed, and it was not clear when it will reopen, authorities said. The so-called painted dogs are about as big as medium-sized domestic dogs, and 37 to 80 pounds, according to the zoo. They have large, rounded ears and dark brown circles around their eyes and are considered endangered. The attack happened in a 1.5 acre exhibit called the Painted Dog Bush Camp that&#039;s part of a larger open area where elephants, lions and other animals can be seen. Visitors walk onto a deck that is glassed on the sides, but open in front where the roughly four-foot railing is located. In May, some of the dogs crawled under a fence and escaped into a part of the exhibit that&#039;s usually closed. The zoo was on lockdown for about an hour as a precaution. Past fatal attacks at have prompted zoos around the nation to review safety features of their exhibits. In 2007 a tiger jumped over a wall at the San Francisco zoo, killing one visitor and wounding two others. Authorities first said the wall was 18 feet high, but a review found it was just 12 1/2 feet. In September a man jumped off an elevated viewing train at the Bronx Zoo in New York and was severely mauled by tigers. Kraus said there was nothing to prevent visitors to the painted dog exhibit from jumping into the exhibit area. Police and the Allegheny County medical examiner&#039;s office are investigating, and they haven&#039;t yet interviewed the mother and father, who are receiving grief counseling. Baker said the zoo, which has never had a visitor death, will also investigate. She said no decision has been made yet on the future of the exhibit.','http://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2012/11/04/Pittsburgh-Zoo-police-investigating-fatal-mauling-of-child-at-African-painted-dogs-exhibit/stories/201211040210','Unknown','Unknown','1','0',1,2,0,0,2,'Uniform',1,1,0,0,0,0),(1509,'2009-10-22','Pennsylvania','Reading','Reading Police Department, Animal Rescue League of Berks County',1,2,1,'Unconfirmed','From the Reading Eagle: Cathy Reinert of Leesport has been doing odd jobs periodically for a woman who owns a house in northeast Reading, but she may have never been of more help to that 75-year-old woman than when she was being attacked by a neighbor&#039;s pit bull. Her friend and occasional employer, Virginia Kusnir, 75, who now lives in Kutztown, was handing down bricks to Reinert from the raised backyard of her former home as Reinert needed them to replace missing sidewalk bricks. Reinert, 47, who is deaf, was on the sidewalk on Douglass Street at North 12th Street on Thursday about 12:45 p.m. &quot;The dog was next door and she (Kusnir) was in her yard,&quot; Reinert recalled Friday. &quot;I looked up and saw something jumped on her. I went up (the steps to the yard) and kicked the dog in the head.&quot; But the large male pit bull turned on her, biting her left hip and thigh. The dog clamped its powerful jaws onto Kusnir&#039;s right arm, dragging her in circles around Reinert. A passer-by, Jose Torres, 40, jumped into the fray. Torres and his friend, Twilla Estright, 32, had been eating lunch at Estright&#039;s house less than a block away. As they were leaving they saw the dog jump the 3-foot-high wire mesh fence and heard Kusnir scream for help. &quot;He had her on the ground and he was shaking her arm, and I mean in a circle,&quot; Torres said. Torres said he picked up Reinert&#039;s hand tool from the sidewalk, went up to the yard and hit the dog - to no avail. He eventually grabbed a rake and hit the dog, including once to its chest, causing the dog to wheeze. Torres cornered the dog against a fence in the rear of the yard until police arrived. Reinert carried Kusnir from the yard and put her on the steps until an ambulance arrived. She said Kusnir was covered in blood and that Estright put towels and pressure on Kusnir&#039;s wounds. Police arrived and drew their guns. Although animal control officers from the Animal Rescue League of Berks County in Cumru Township were on the way, police deemed the dog to be an imminent threat and shot it several times, killing it, said Deputy Chief Mark E. Talbot Sr. Talbot said all shootings involving people or animals are reviewed by the department. An ambulance took Kusnir and Reinert to Reading Hospital. Kusnir suffered deep cuts and puncture wounds to both thighs and a bite wound to her upper right arm and remained in the hospital in good condition Friday. She declined to be interviewed. Reinert was treated for bites to a hip and thigh and received rabies vaccine shots. Torres and several other people who live in the neighborhood, just a block from Reading High School, said the dog had been aggressive for months. The dog&#039;s owner, Benita Rosario, whose age was unavailable, was cited for failing to confine her dog. Rosario could not be reached for comment. Reinert said she has known Kusnir for about 10 years and that it was horrifying to see her mauled. &quot;She&#039;s more like my mom than a friend,&quot; she said.','http://www2.readingeagle.com/article.aspx?id=162752','Unknown','Unknown','1','0',2,1,0,2,1,'Uniform',1,3,0,0,0,0),(1510,'2011-03-31','California','Murrieta','Murrieta Police Department',1,50,1,'Argentine Dogo','From the Associated Press:  A policeman shot a vicious dog roaming a Southern California neighborhood, then followed the wounded animal to the owner&#039;s marijuana growing and selling operation.

Knight was released from Reading Hospital on Thursday after undergoing surgery for bite wounds on his forearms and a leg suffered during the attack Wednesday in his driveway.

Knight said he was carrying a bag of football jerseys to his truck when the dog, Akeel, bit the bag and pulled it from him. &quot;I yelled for Akeel to drop the bag and he dropped it and grabbed onto my arm,&quot; Knight said. &quot;He had been aggressive before, but he had never gone after me like that.&quot; Knight said he had owned the 4-year-old animal for about 1 1/2 years and never had trouble with it. But when the dog latched onto his right forearm, it was the start of a running battle. &quot;I wanted to get him off of me, but the way he was acting I also wanted to keep him away from my family,&quot; Knight said. &quot;I started leading him around the side of my truck with my forearm and tried to lock him in my shed. I got him into the shed and finally managed to pull my arm out of the shed and shut the doors.&quot; No sooner did he have Akeel locked in the shed than the angry dog squeezed through a hole near the bottom of the shed doors and attacked Knight again, biting his left arm. The dog also bit Knight&#039;s leg as he and the dog wrestled on the ground. Both Knight&#039;s legs were bandaged and it was unclear how the other was hurt. Police said Stephanie Knight told them she tried to break the dog&#039;s bite by hitting it on the head with a shovel. She later got a kitchen knife from the house and stabbed the dog in the neck and back, but it still wouldn&#039;t stop attacking her husband. She called police.

As the patrolmen stepped away from the dog, it continued to inch closer to them, they said. Police left a voice message on its owners cell phone and called the Trumbull County dog warden for assistance, but he was unavailable due to an injury, they said. While they were making the calls, the dog charged several times and tried to bite at a catch pole used by the patrolmen, they said. Pickard said he tried using a handful of dog treats to calm the dog, but was unsuccessful. The dog also continued to charge at him after being electronically shocked, he said. The dog then walked to the homes backyard into a kennel, Pickard said. As he tried to get closer to the kennel to lock the dog inside, it turned and started to charge at him. Pickard said he yelled several times at the dog to stop and get back before firing at the dog with his gun. The dog seemed even more agitated and Kasiewicz shot it a second time as it came near him, he said. Trumbull County Animal Welfare said no testing was needed on the dog and it was taken to the police station until its owner, Shawn Allen Rainey, was contacted. Rainey was charged with failing to restrain a vicious dog and for having police euthanize it. He was adamant the dog couldnt have been so uncontrollable and believed police were lying, they said.

Police and a neighbor who witnessed the shooting say it was justified by the two-year-old boxer&rsquo;s threatening behavior but the dog&rsquo;s owner says Jezebel was just &ldquo;playful.&rdquo; Through tears on Saturday afternoon, Barry Laskowitz shook his head and said, &ldquo;Why&rsquo;d they have to kill her? They shot her. I can&rsquo;t believe they shot her, it doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.&rdquo; &ldquo;The dog is a nuisance,&rdquo; neighbor Connie Gilliam said. She said she was &ldquo;right in the middle of everything&rdquo; and &ldquo;the officer did what he had to do &ndash; he had no choice.&rdquo; Hermitage police issued a four-page police report on the incident Saturday that laid out the events that led up to the dog&rsquo;s shooting and noted that this was the seventh time they had to respond to a call about Jezebel. The report detailed the previous instances when the dog ran loose and chased people, bit someone, or acted in an aggressive manner. The last call to police on Friday was of the dog running loose around the neighborhood. The patrolman who responded was identified by Laskowitz and Gilliam as Derek Songer. Police said they tried unsuccessfully to contact the Shenango Valley Animal Shelter and called Laskowitz, who told them he was at work and couldn&rsquo;t come and get the dog. Three children at Laskowitz home at 111 Wick Ave. told police that Jezebel had been running loose for about two hours. The patrolman and neighbors tried to corral the dog for 30-40 minutes, using treats to lure her inside, police said. &ldquo;He was more than patient,&rdquo; Gilliam said. The dog circled around behind Songer and nipped him in the ankles, Gilliam said. Police said he jumped back and drew his gun. The dog started &ldquo;growling aggressively,&rdquo; police said. Gilliam said she could not tell if the dog was being playful or threatening. She said Songer backed up with his flashlight and gun pointed at the dog. &ldquo;The officer was certain/feared of an impending attack,&rdquo; police said. Jezebel charged Songer and he shot the dog, police said. &ldquo;Why couldn&rsquo;t they use pepper spray or a tranquilizer gun,&rdquo; Laskowitz said. &ldquo;Why&rsquo;d they have to kill her?&rdquo; Laskowitz said Jezebel was nice and playful and never attacked anyone. He admitted the police had cited him on two previous occasions over the dog. In their report Hermitage police say that Jezebel bit a pedestrian on Nov. 22 and tried to bite a mailman on May 1. Crystal Tuttle, Jezebel&rsquo;s other owner, called police on Oct. 8 because the dog kept getting out and running loose, police said. She wanted police to use a Taser on the dog to make it listen, police said. They told her that they could only use &ldquo;tools&rdquo; if it was a threat to police or others. Police said they have written statements from neighbors that the dog &ldquo;kept trying to come at them&rdquo; on Friday. &ldquo;If they would&rsquo;ve controlled the dog, this wouldn&rsquo;t have happened,&rdquo; Gilliam said. After the shooting, police said Tuttle arrived and told her three children to go look at the dead dog. Gilliam said she told the girls to go back inside and police said the two women argued and had to be separated. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want those kids to see that.&rdquo; Gilliam said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad my son slept through the whole thing, it&rsquo;s just sad.&rdquo;','http://www.sharonherald.com/news/local_news/cop-shoots-kills-dog-acting-aggressively/article_519d220b-5262-5df1-87e0-a4b8a090f4f8.html?mode=jqm','Jezebel','Derek Songer','2','0',1,0,0,0,2,'Uniform',1,2,0,0,0,0),(1530,'0000-00-00','Pennsylvania','Sharon','Sharon City Police Department',1,50,0,'American Bulldog, 7 yo','Three people bitten and seriously injured by a dog are waiting for test results to determine if the dog eventually shot by Sharon police had rabies. &ldquo;Harley,&rdquo; a 7-year-old American bulldog, bit a man and a woman during the incident at about 6 p.m. Monday at 497 Columbia St., police Chief Mike Menster said. He declined to identify them. He said they were acquainted with the dog&rsquo;s owner, John Rogers, 39, who was not home at the time. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not sure of the relationships but the people involved knew each other,&rdquo; Menster said. The first victim, a 44-year-old man who lives at that West Hill address, was trying to remove the dog from the lap of a woman sitting on a chair. It bit him on the face, jaw and both arms, causing severe injuries. The woman, 44, also of Sharon, was bitten on a leg and wrist when she grabbed the dog to pull it away from the man. They eventually managed to chain the dog outside, Menster said. The man&rsquo;s mother came to the house and began applying compresses to slow his heavy loss of blood, Menster said. When police arrived and were walking with the victim, accompanied by his mother, out of the house, the dog lunged and bit both her and her son, grabbing his arm and holding on, Menster said. &ldquo;It held on like Vice-grips,&rdquo; Menster said, &ldquo;and didn&rsquo;t let go until the officer shot it. He shot it three times.&rdquo; The man, who was taken by ambulance to the hospital of Sharon Regional Health System, &ldquo;had severe injuries to his mouth, jaw and face and will likely need plastic surgery,&rdquo; Menster said. His mother also went to the hospital. EMTs with the ambulance told the woman bitten on the wrist and leg she would need stitches and she was taken privately for treatment, Menster said. Rogers, who returned home later, told police he had given the dog away during the winter but that person returned it to him because it had bitten someone else, Menster said. Rogers could not show that the dog had current immunizations. As a result, it was taken to Meadville for testing by a veterinarian, Menster said. &ldquo;We will wait until we have all the information we need before we consider any charges,&rdquo; Menster said. Gerda Widmyer, whose Sharon-based nonprofit Animal Advocacy deals with animal issues, said rabies tests in cases like this typically take a day or two to yield results. She said Harley was an unneutered male and has been euthanized. Animal Advocacy helped Rogers with a portion of those expenses, she said. Widmyer took the opportunity to stress the importance of vaccinating pets. &ldquo;We have rabies here in the valley and Mercer County,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Rabies is a lethal disease &ndash; and not just for dogs and cats.

Patrick Bailey of Cedar Avenue said he wasn&#039;t home when his German shepherd, Buddy, was shot Sunday morning in front of his house. Bailey claims someone let Buddy out of his house and removed his collar on purpose, and he says it&#039;s not the first time that has happened. Police said they were called to the 500 block of Cedar because the dog had been loose for a couple of days and was chasing and barking at a neighbor. While the patrolman was waiting for animal control, the dog became aggressive and advanced on the policeman who was near a young boy delivering newspapers in the neighborhood, police said. There were also several children and a grandmother who were on nearby and were in danger, police said. After several unsuccessful attempts to stop the dog with pepper spray, the patrolman shot at the dog 27 times -- though he didn&#039;t hit the dog that many times, police said. Bailey said he&#039;s not angry with the police but thinks the number of shots was excessive. &quot;The officer did what he was supposed to do,&quot; Chief Thomas Burke said. He said the patrolman protected the kids and a grandmother who were on the playground. &quot;I&#039;m not going to second guess him because I wasn&#039;t there. I&#039;m sure he made the right decision, and I stand behind him. He&#039;s a good officer,&quot; Burke said. Bailey said he thinks Buddy was trying to &quot;protect&quot; the delivery boy from the patrolman. He said Buddy was never a vicious dog though he was territorial and large. Bailey said he&#039;s concerned about the number of shots in a residential neighborhood. &quot;It seemed like he was more interested in shooting the dog than protecting the neighbors,&quot; Bailey said. &quot;It wasn&#039;t something he wanted to do. It was something he had to do,&quot; Burke said. He added that the patrolman was &quot;pretty shaken up&quot; over the incident. Bailey claims that several of his neighbors gave a different account of the incident than police gave, and said that Buddy wasn&#039;t acting aggressive. Bailey said Buddy was a family pet and very special to his two small sons. He attended a city council meeting Thursday and told council it would be nice if the chief would look into helping the family get another puppy. Bailey also suggested the police carry tranquilizer guns in case of situations like the one with Buddy. Sharon police said they were forced to shoot a dog that had been tormenting residents and was a danger to children in the 500 block of Cedar Avenue. Police were called just before 9 a.m. Sunday about an aggressive, loose dog that had chased a man several times over the past few days, police said. The man told police the German shepherd jumped out of bushes on his property and tried to bite him Saturday, and Sunday morning the dog was again on his property and chased him. The neighbor told police the dogs owner, Patrick Bailey, hadnt been home for a few days. He said he left a message for Bailey on his cellular phone but hadnt heard from him, police said. Police gave the following account of the incident: While police were waiting for an animal control agent to arrive the dog approached a paperboy making his deliveries and a patrolman. The dog was barking and bearing its teeth. The patrolman put the boy behind him and tried to stop the dog with pepper spray. After several sprays the dog lay down on the sidewalk. The patrolman took the boy across the street to the C.M. Musser Elementary School playground, where a grandmother and several children were. The dog watched the patrolman for awhile and then approached him and the children again, barking and bearing its teeth. Once the dog was within 12 feet of the group, the patrolman drew his gun and sprayed the dog with pepper spray again but it didnt stop the dog. The patrolman then shot the dog three times. The dog ran back to its owners porch and then approached on the patrolman again. The patrolman fired at the dog 27 times until it was dead. The dog was not wearing tags or a collar, police said.

But according to police Lt. James Baker and the Murcko family who found the dog hanging around their place, the collie was acting aggressively and foaming at the mouth. &quot;I don&rsquo;t feel good about what happened and I wish I didn&rsquo;t have to do that, but when you have a choice between protecting people or saving a dog, people&rsquo;s safety has to come first,&quot; Baker said. But owner Tammy Carano thinks the lieutenant was out of line. &quot;Sunny Bunny was not a stray. He was part of our family. They could have tried harder to find the owners,&quot; she said, explaining that her dog didn&rsquo;t have its tags on because he always was kept on a chain or in the house. &quot;I&rsquo;ve been having terrible, awful nightmares since this incident. I had to go to my doctor to get some nerve pills.&quot; Sunny and Bonnie, a 4-year old springer spaniel, had gotten out of the Carano home on Merwin Chase Road via a sliding glass door after 3:30 p.m. while the family was away and the canines ended up at the Murcko residence about a quarter-mile away after 4 p.m. Responding to a 911 call from the Murckos about stray dogs they had penned in their barn, Baker shooed the dogs away and left. &quot;I was frustrated when I left, because I felt I didn&rsquo;t really handle it,&quot; Baker said. &quot;I thought, what if they come back? Did I put the people at risk?&quot; About an hour later, the dogs returned, and Baker responded to a second 911 call. The dispatcher said the caller, Geraldine Murcko, was hysterical and concerned that her 18-month-old granddaughter would be bitten by the dogs. When Baker returned, he only saw the collie, and it growled at him as he stepped from his cruiser, then seemed to lunge at Mrs. Murcko when she opened the door to see where the dog was. Both Baker and the Murckos said Sunny was growling both times, and looked as if he were foaming at the mouth. &quot;It looked like he had an inch of toothpaste on the left side of his mouth,&quot; said Baker. &quot;I was waiting for the county dog warden to return my calls through dispatch to advise me of what I should do. The final resort was to put the dog down, and I had to make the decision because I hadn&rsquo;t heard from the dog warden whose responsibility it is to deal with this.&quot; When Baker finally heard from a deputy dog warden, the dispatcher told the deputy that Baker had decided to shoot the dog and wanted to know what to do with it. According to the 911 tape, the assistant, Tim Morgan, said, &quot;Bag the bodies.&quot; Later on the tape, the dispatcher asks Morgan if police should handle such situations in that manner. Morgan says yes and adds that a dog warden won&rsquo;t go to a call unless someone has been bitten. &quot;So we have to wait for someone to get bitten before they will act? I don&rsquo;t understand that kind of thinking,&quot; Baker said. But Mrs. Carano, who had a rabies certificate for Sunny that expires in June, blames Baker. &quot;He owes my family an apology. My dog was hot and was sweating from his mouth. He was scared because he was in a strange place,&quot; she said, claiming her dogs rarely ran loose. &quot;Since when did Brookfield police become veterinarians? I just don&rsquo;t want this to happen again.&quot; But Baker said it will happen again, unfortunately, as long as the county dog warden refuses to respond to calls, which has been the police department&rsquo;s experience. &quot;You want me to say I&rsquo;m sorry that I did the wrong thing and I&rsquo;m saying I&rsquo;m sorry that I was put in the position to make a decision, when the responsibility belonged to another department,&quot; Baker said.','http://www2.sharonherald.com/localnews/recentnews/0104/ln041101b.html','Sunny and Bonnie','James Baker - shooter, Tim Morgan','1','0',1,0,0,2,2,'Uniform',1,3,2,2,2,2),(1535,'2006-11-18','Pennsylvania','Farrell','Southwest Regional Police Department',1,2,1,'Unconfirmed','A Southwest Mercer County Regional police sergeant was hit Saturday by a bullet meant for an aggressive dog.

But the dog&rsquo;s owner said the shooting was uncalled for and she wants to fight a citation that charges her with failing to secure a vicious dog. Debra Wodnick has 10 days from the day she receives the citation to plead guilty and pay a $50 fine plus costs, or plead not guilty and ask for a hearing before District Justice Henry J. Russo, Hermitage. The charge was filed under a Shenango Township ordinance. However, Ms. Wodnick, who had not seen the citation, is in the process of moving to Florida and hopes to be gone by April 15. Preston said he went to 164 Burrows Road, Ms. Wodnick&rsquo;s home, at 1:10 p.m. Monday to answer a complaint from a township supervisor about garbage in the yard and on the road. Ms. Wodnick said a neighbor&rsquo;s dog had gotten into the garbage and it blew into the yard and onto the road. Preston, who has been chief since 1980, said he parked the cruiser and was going to walk up to the house. He had just gotten out of the patrol car when a dog charged at him, growling and snapping. Preston said he got back in the car and honked the horn to try to alert someone in the house. A young girl came to the door and he yelled for her to control the dog. The dog quieted down and went to the porch and Preston stepped out of the car, but the girl went inside the house, he said. &ldquo;The dog came flying across the yard, growling and snapping,&rdquo; Preston said. Preston said he drew his handgun and shot twice when the dog leapt at him. &ldquo;The first shot took him out of the air,&rdquo; he said. Preston said police are trained to shoot twice in that situation. Ms. Wodnick said her daughter, Sandra Horning, left the doorway to put on shoes when she heard three shots. Preston said he only fired twice. &ldquo;It was thoroughly uncalled for,&rdquo; Ms. Wodnick said of the shooting. &ldquo;She could have taken the dog inside or something,&rdquo; Preston said of Ms. Horning. Kathleen Whiteman, assistant dog warden, wrote on the citation that Preston was attacked. &ldquo;Chief had no choice but to shoot the dog to warrant off the attack,&rdquo; she wrote. Ms. Whiteman also wrote that the citation was filed based on Preston&rsquo;s account. Ms. Wodnick said she was upset that the chief didn&rsquo;t apologize or show regret. &ldquo;He stood out there screaming at her to get the garbage cleaned up,&rdquo; said Ms. Wodnick, who was not home at the time of the incident. &ldquo;It was just unreal.&rdquo; &ldquo;It was an unfortunate happening,&rdquo; Preston said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to stand there while this dog comes after me. I didn&rsquo;t feel good about doing it, trust me&rdquo; Preston said he has shot dogs before and remembered one time when he shot an injured dog that was loose on Interstate 80 and state police thought it might cause an accident. He said he had never before shot a dog under the same circumstances as Monday, when a dog was attacking him. Preston said he could not get back to his car before the dog would have gotten to him because he was six to eight feet away from the cruiser and would have had to go around a tree. The dog was about six or seven feet away when he fired. &ldquo;The dog was coming at a full charge,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I had no other option or I would have exercised it.&rdquo; Preston said he didn&rsquo;t consider trying to call the dog warden because he believed the easiest way to handle the dog was for the owner to get it under control. Preston added he doesn&rsquo;t see how anyone can criticize his action because when the shots were fired the girl was inside the house and he was left alone. &ldquo;Nobody saw anything but me,&rdquo; he said. The dog was not under control and had no rabies certification or license attached to it at the time of the attack, according to the citation. Ms. Wodnick said the dog, Alex, had a collar license but probably pulled it off, which it had done frequently. She said it also has had its rabies shots and she would try to find documentation of them. The dog was loose, having broken his chain, Ms. Wodnick said, but was not an aggressive dog. She said her 14-month-old grandson climbed on the dog and the dog has never hurt him. Alex was a 5-year-old mutt. His mother was part cocker spaniel, poodle and black Labrador retriever. Ms. Wodnick said the dog was about knee high and she estimated it weighed 100 pounds, with a blondish-white coat. The citation said the dog was brown. Preston said he had seen the dog in the past while cruising but had never dealt with it before.','http://www2.sharonherald.com/localnews/recentnews/0004/ln040600a.html','Alex','Police Chief Ronald Preston','2','0',1,0,0,0,1,'Uniform',0,2,0,0,2,0),(1537,'2002-03-29','Pennsylvania','Sharpsville','Sharpsville Boro Police Department, South Pymatuning Township Police Department',2,2,1,'Unconfirmed','A Sharpsville man whose pit bull terriers were shot March 29 by police was found guilty of disorderly conduct Thursday at the conclusion of a 90-minute, emotional summary trial before District Justice James E.

Blair said today he doesn&#039;t plan to appeal because he thought McMahon&#039;s decision was fair, but he plans to file a civil suit against the police department to pay a $464 vet bill for his female dog. Blair, who defended himself, broke down as he gave his closing statement. &quot;For three years those dogs were in my life ... when I came home that day and heard those dogs were shot, I felt like someone had told me, you know what, kid? No matter what you do we&#039;re going to put a label on you. They&#039;re pit bulls. So what?&quot; Blair said. Blair also pleaded not guilty for failing to confine his dogs, a charge that McMahon dropped because he said there was not enough evidence to prove Blair let the dogs out of their kennel. Blair pleaded guilty to not having the dogs&#039; rabies shots and licenses up-to-date and was fined $100 and $150, respectively. Blair said he forgot to get the dogs&#039; shots and licenses. Charges of disorderly conduct against Blair&#039;s sister, Emily Kettering, 19, of 271 Spruce Ave., Sharon, were dropped. Blair said he just wants answers. During the trial, when Blair asked Rosa why he did not go to Blair&#039;s mother&#039;s nearby house for assistance with the dogs, Rosa said he did not know the dogs were Blair&#039;s. When Blair asked Rosa why he didn&#039;t use Mace, Rosa said the goal was to contain the dogs, and spraying Mace on them would have caused them to run away. Police received a report on March 29 that the dogs were running loose in the neighborhood and had confronted a pregnant woman, Rebekah Patton, and her 2-year-old son. Mrs. Patton, of 428 S. Walnut St., testified that she and her son were running errands that day and when they returned home, she saw a large black dog in the neighbor&#039;s side yard. She said the dog ran at them and, frightened, she picked up her son. Her neighbors tried to distract the dog. By this time the second dog was in the neighbor&#039;s yard. Neighbors distracted the dogs by throwing bricks and Mrs. Patton and her son were able to get back into their sport-utility vehicle, she said. They stayed in the SUV until neighbors said the dogs were gone. Mrs. Patton then went into her house and called her husband, Timothy Patton. The dogs later confronted her Labrador retriever, which was tied outside, and she called 911, she said. Patton testified after his wife called him, &quot;very upset,&quot; he called 911. He then went home and arrived at the same time as Rosa. Patton put his dog in the house. Rosa testified that at 1:45 p.m. that day a woman came into the police station and said there were two pit bulls running loose at Walnut Street and Mercer Avenue. When Rosa got to the intersection, he said, traffic was backed up in both directions and he saw two pit bulls, neither wearing collars or tags, walking between cars. Rosa said he thought the dogs belonged to Bethany Phillips, who also lives at 352 Walnut St. He knocked on the door to get her help in catching the dogs, but no one was home. So Rosa went to Ms. Phillips&#039; grandparents&#039; house on Milliken Avenue. Her grandmother, Denise Harshman, agreed to accompany him, he said. While en route from the Harshman residence, Rosa received the call that the dogs confronted Mrs. Patton. When he arrived at the Patton house, Rosa saw the pit bulls confronting the Lab. He left the cruiser with his shotgun, which he said is standard equipment in a police cruiser. Rosa said his goal was to confine the dogs until animal control staff arrived. The male dog crossed in front of him, getting closer, then stopped and ran toward him with its paws off the ground. Rosa shot the male dog, and the female ran through the back yards toward Blair&#039;s home, he said. Rosa said that he and South Pymatuning Township Patrolman Jeff Dillinger tried to keep the female dog contained in Blair&#039;s yard but it ran back and forth between them and Mrs. Harshman tried unsuccessfully to get it inside. When the dog came at Rosa with its teeth bared, Rosa shot at it twice. The second shot glanced off the dog&#039;s shoulder, and it ran. Rosa and Dillinger located the dog 15 to 20 minutes later on Mercer Avenue, he said. Blair&#039;s mother removed the dog from the scene. Rosa said when Blair arrived he was yelling, screaming, swearing and sobbing and despite repeated warnings, Blair failed to calm down and had to be arrested. Blair said the reason he did not calm down was because Rosa would not answer him when he asked where his dogs were. Rosa said he told Blair that his dogs were running loose and had to be put down. Sharpsville Police Chief Bruce Rosa acted lawfully when he shot and killed two pit bulls on March 29, said Mercer County District Attorney James P. Epstein. Rosa shot the pit bulls owned by Geno Blair, 23, of 352 Walnut St. after police received a call that two dogs were running loose in the Walnut Street area. Police said the dogs had confronted a pregnant woman and her 2-year-old son and then confronted Rosa and a South Pymatuning Township patrolman. Epstein said he has reviewed Rosas report, including statements made by Blair and the people who called the police about the dogs. Epstein said the dog law states: It shall be the duty of every police officer to seize and detain every dog running at large unaccompanied by its owner or keeper. The law goes on to say that police may humanely kill any dog running at large if it poses a threat to public welfare. There is a duty placed upon police to detain animals running loose, and they are given the authority under the law to destroy them if they believe they constitute a threat to public health and welfare, Epstein said. Epstein said that based on the report, Rosas belief that the dogs were a threat was not unreasonable. Blair, who was cited for disorderly conduct after his dogs were killed, has set up a memorial in front of his house in honor of his pit bulls, Foxy Brown and Shaft. He claims the police murdered them. Blair said the dogs were locked in their kennel when he left for work that day and does not know how they got out. I havent been able to get a formal answer yet about what happened, Blair said this morning. He said the police report and the accounts he got from witnesses dont sound right. He said witnesses have told him the dogs were not aggressive. Blair says he wants Rosa to justify killing his dogs. He plans to assemble a list of questions about the case and get 1,000 signatures, then present the petition to Rosa. Im not looking for vengenance, revenge. Nothing will bring my dogs out of the ground, nothing will bring my friend back, he said. I do feel that he (Rosa), as the officer who shot both of my dogs, should have to justify himself to what he did.','http://www2.sharonherald.com/localnews/recentnews/0204/ln041902a.html','Unknown','Police Chief Bruce Rosa - shooter, Jeff Dillinger','0','0',1,0,0,1,1,'Uniform',3,3,0,0,2,0),(1538,'2008-12-31','Pennsylvania','Erie','Erie City Police Department, Association for Needy and Neglected Animals',2,2,1,'Unconfirmed','An Erie police officer shot a pit bull who chased a man into Lake Erie.

One was another dog that suffered extensive injuries. The other was a fallow deer at the Erie Zoo that died of its wounds. The owner of the dog, identified in court records as Zackery Ekstrom, of Erie, received two citations from Erie Animal Enforcement Officer Rob Culbertson after the attacks. The one concerning the zoo deer was withdrawn a week ago, at the zoo&#039;s request, police said Thursday. Ekstrom pleaded guilty to the other citation Wednesday and was ordered to pay fines, costs and restitution totaling nearly $7,000. Ekstrom had been scheduled to appear in court Thursday for summary trials on each of the summary citations for failure to control his dog, a male husky named Thor. Culbertson accused Thor of attacking a dog in the 1000 block of West 31st Street on Feb. 18 at about 3 a.m. Five hours later, police said the dog entered the Erie Zoo, at 423 W. 38th St., and attacked the 17-year-old doe. A police officer shot and killed Thor after police said it would not move away from the fallen deer, and officers became concerned for their safety because of the dog&#039;s demeanor.

Millcreek Police Lt. Michael Tesore interviewed Addison&#039;s parents Monday, but the conversation didn&#039;t shed any more light on why the old English sheepdog attacked the morning of July 24, Tesore said. &quot;Everything was as usual,&quot; Tesore said. &quot;It was a regular family day until the dog, for unknown reasons, turned on the baby.&quot; Addison was attacked at her family&#039;s home, the Laurel Hill Cemetery caretaker&#039;s cottage, 4523 Love Road. Her father, Brady Sonney, is the grounds supervisor at Laurel Hill, and the family lives in the cottage. Addison&#039;s mother, Kari Sonney, was also injured in the attack. Tesore said the family told him the dog, named Oliver, had not been aggressive toward Addison or the family in the past. He did say, however, that the family was forced to give away a second dog because the new dog did not get along with Oliver. &quot;The family never had any problem with the dog previously,&quot; Tesore said. &quot;They had no knowledge of any attacks on any other people.&quot; Tesore said Oliver had been through obedience training and had been left alone in a room with the children many times before. The dog, which was about 4 at the time of the attack, had been with the Sonney family since he was 8 weeks old, before Addison was born. The morning of the mauling, Addison and her mom were coming from the kitchen into the living room when Kari Sonney turned back into the kitchen for a moment, Tesore said. Addison continued into the living room alone. &quot;It was just a second,&quot; Tesore said. &quot;Then (Kari Sonney) heard a noise, poked her head around the corner -- and the dog had the infant.&quot; Tesore said Kari Sonney rushed to her daughter&#039;s aid, and Oliver turned on her. The family&#039;s older daughter, Morgan, 7, ran outside to get Brady Sonney. He was also bitten before the dog ran from the house. Police hunted down and shot the dog. Officers fired at the dog twice. Five shots were fired in a dense stand of woods at the northeast corner of Love and Zimmerly roads. Four more shots were fired at the dog on the porch where he had taken refuge in the 5000 block of Cristina Drive in the Love Farm subdivision. The officers fired at the dog in the overgrown thicket, despite not having a clear shot, because they were attempting to stop Oliver from continuing into the Love Farm subdivision, Millcreek Police Chief Rich Andrews said. &quot;It was a location that allowed them to fire at the animal and still be away from the subdivision,&quot; Andrews said. The dog was killed on the porch of the home because it became aggressive when officers tried to capture it by putting a noose around its neck, Tesore said. He said officers ushered the family into the backyard before any shots were fired. &quot;That was the safe thing to do,&quot; he said. The family also gave permission to shoot the dog on their property and were warned it could cause damage property, he said. &quot;They told us to do what we had to do,&quot; he said. The dog was shot in the body rather than the head because officers wanted to preserve the head for rabies testing, police said. The dog tested negative for rabies. &quot;As far as I&#039;m concerned, the use of firearms by the officers was appropriate and necessary,&quot; Andrews said. &quot;They were acting following reports that a vicious animal was loose, an animal that had just viciously attacked a child.

Patrolman Tom Dunmire shot the animals to death as they attacked Rob Culbertson. &quot;They wouldn&#039;t get off of him,&quot; said a witness, Dwayne Gross. &quot;They were just attacking.&quot; Culbertson, who does not carry a gun, was taken to Saint Vincent Health Center with bite wounds to his head, arms and legs. He was treated at Saint Vincent&#039;s emergency room and released later in the afternoon. The mauling marked the second time since the summer of 2006 that Erie police fatally shot a dog that attacked Culbertson. Police on June 30, 2006, shot a mixed-breed dog that severely bit Culbertson in the right arm as he tried to subdue it in the 2400 block of Downing Avenue. Friday&#039;s attack also came as Erie police have been researching whether Culbertson should carry a Taser stun gun, Erie police spokesman Lt. Kirk Werner said. He said Culbertson is not certified to carry a firearm. &quot;Our dogcatchers through history have never carried a weapon,&quot; Werner said. &quot;I&#039;m not saying if that&#039;s right or wrong, that&#039;s just the way it&#039;s been.&quot; Erie police Chief Steve Franklin did not return calls seeking comment. Werner said Culbertson, the Erie police&#039;s only animal enforcement officer, is backed up by police officers on any calls Culbertson considers dangerous. That&#039;s why an officer was at the scene with him Friday, Werner said. &quot;We knew there were pit bulls in that house,&quot; he said. Werner praised Dunmire, the officer who shot the dogs. &quot;He was quick-thinking and cool-acting in the face of a very dangerous situation,&quot; Werner said. &quot;He did a very good job -- it could have been a lot worse.&quot; Gross, the witness, said he saw Dunmire try to pull the pit bulls off Culbertson before Dunmire leveled his gun and started firing. Gross said he saw the dogs grab Culbertson by the legs and drag him to the street just before Culberston reached the safety of his animal control truck. &quot;There was no doubt he had to shoot,&quot; Gross said. &quot;It was either shoot the dogs or this guy&#039;s going to get eaten. He got lucky that there was a police officer there.&quot; Culbertson could not be reached for comment. The attack happened as Culbertson and Dunmire responded to a call at 934 W. 17th St. at about 2:30 p.m. The home&#039;s landlord, identified by police as Robert Eggleston, had complained that the tenants had moved and left their dogs behind. Eggleston let Culbertson and Dunmire into the house. The three were talking in the kitchen when two pit bulls shoved the chained basement door open a crack, police said The dogs escaped. Eggleston fled out the front door. Culberston and Dunmire dived out a side door. The pit bulls charged behind them. They got Culbertson. &quot;He was on the ground,&quot; Eggleston said. &quot;They were all over him.&quot; Seven shells police collected from West 17th Street lay on top of a police cruiser at the scene. One of the dogs, a small black pit bull, lay dead in the street. The other dog, wounded, ran back into the house and died inside, police said. A woman who identified herself as the dogs&#039; owner, Marivi Rodriguez, 20, was angry and crying as she confronted the landlord and police officers. She arrived after the dogs were shot. She identified the dogs as Leela and Uno. Rodriguez said she had an agreement with the landlord that she could stay at the house, which has no electricity or running water. Eggleston showed police documents that indicated the tenant was supposed to be out of the house by Sept. 10. He also showed them a lease that specified no pets were allowed in the house. A total of four pit bulls were inside the house when Culbertson and Dunmire arrived, police said. Three -- a mother and two of her offspring -- were locked in the basement. A fourth dog, a large male, was chained in an upstairs bedroom. Eggleston said dog food was on the floor of the house and no furniture was inside. Werner, the police department spokesman, said police are investigating which charges to file over the incident.  ALTERNATE COVERAGE The pit bulls were named Lilo and Stitch, after the good-natured animated Disney characters. Their actions told a different story. The dogs looked like they knew what they were doing when they worked together to maul an Erie animal-control officer in September, the Erie police officer who shot at the dogs testified against their owner. It seemed orchestrated, like they were practiced, Patrolman Tom Dunmire said at a trial Tuesday. They went for his legs and took him to the ground and then immediately went for his neck. The owner, Dwayne Jenkins, was found guilty of harboring a dangerous dog. Erie 3rd Ward District Judge Tom Carney convicted Jenkins of the summary offense and sentenced him to three days in Erie County Prison. Jenkins, 20, will remain out of prison for at least 30 days, or the deadline for filing an appeal. It was his second conviction this month connected to a dog attack. Carney sentenced him to another three days in prison Oct. 1 after a neighbor told police that Stitch bit her 5-year-old daughter in early September. In that case, Carney found Jenkins guilty of failure to control an animal. Rob Culbertson, the Erie Bureau of Police animal control officer, was attacked Sept. 21 after he and Dunmire entered a residence at 934 W. 17th St. at the request of the landlord. The landlord, Robert Eggleston, told police the tenants had abandoned the home and left their dogs behind. At the time of the attack, Eggleston had a rental agreement with Andrea Jones, Jenkins aunt. The rental agreement specified that no pets were allowed in the home. Dunmire and Culbertson testified that they saw three dogs locked in the basement and a fourth pit bull chained upstairs of the home, which they said was empty of furniture. Police said officers and Eggleston were in the kitchen trying to decide how to capture the dogs when two of the dogs managed to squeeze their way through a crack between the chained basement door and wall. Thats when the chaos started, Culbertson testified during the hour-long hearing Tuesday. The officers and landlord fled the building ahead of the dogs. But Lilo and Stitch caught up with Culbertson outside and brought him to the ground. The dogs bit Culbertson in the head, arms and legs. He required medical treatment. Unable to pull the attacking dogs off Culbertson, Dunmire shot and killed Lilo. He also shot repeatedly at Stitch, hitting the dog twice before it made its way back inside the home. In the hours after the shooting, police reported Stitch had also died. The dog lived, however. Jenkins took him to Glenwood Animal Hospital for treatment. Culbertson said the estimated veterinarian bill was more than $500. The dog is now in Jenkins custody, said Jenkins stepfather, Albert Barnes, who attended Tuesdays hearing. Because of the two attacks, Culbertson said police plan to ask that Stitch be designated a dangerous dog. If a judge agrees, the dog will likely be destroyed. Police had charged Jenkins with harboring a dangerous dog and failure to control an animal in the attack on Culbertson. Carney threw out the charge of failure to control an animal because the dogs were locked in the basement. Jenkins mother, Cynthia Jones, was angry when she addressed Carney at sentencing. She said Eggleston, the landlord, should have called the homes tenant -- Andrea Jones, Jenkins aunt -- before calling police. Why didnt he say call Andrea Jones and ask her to remove the dogs? Cynthia Jones said. Why wasnt that phone call made before it came to this?','http://www.goerie.com/article/20070922/NEWS02/709220376','Lilo AKA Leela, Stitch AKA Uno, two unidentified puppies','Rob Culbertson, Tom Dunmire - Shooter','1','0',2,1,0,2,2,'Uniform',2,0,0,0,0,0),(1550,'2008-07-01','Pennsylvania','Erie','Erie City Police Department',1,50,1,'Unconfirmed','Erie police have shot and killed a pit bull that attacked its owner and a 10-year-old boy at a home in the 1000 block of East Ninth Street.

One of the dogs, a male that was acting aggressively when police arrived, was shot to death after officers determined that it was too risky to try to capture it with so many people around. &quot;He was just attacking everybody,&quot; said Dalton Animal Control Officer Mike McClay, who put down the male dog. &quot;There was no way around it.&quot; Dalton Police Officer John Thibodeau echoed McClay&#039;s assessment. &quot;He was very aggressive toward us,&quot; Thibodeau said. &quot;He wasn&#039;t going to be noosed (captured).&quot; The second dog, a female, was slightly more docile and was captured with a catch-pole and noose. She was transported to the Eleanor Sonsini Animal Shelter, where she will be quarantined under law for at least 10 days, McClay said. The victim, whom police have not identified, was returning home on Gertrude Street with a friend&#039;s son around 4 p.m. when he was attacked, police said. When police arrived, the dogs were still running loose outside the house. The victim, a white male in his 30s, was found inside his apartment with bite wounds to the face and the left thigh. He was transported to Berkshire Medical Center. Police did not know his medical condition. Dalton Police Officer Matt Mozzi said the victim had &quot;significant&quot; injuries that were not life-threatening. The names, breeds and ages of the dogs were not known, but they appeared to be pit bull-type dogs. The dogs&#039; owner was not home at the time. For safety, police asked a nearby day care center to keep everyone indoors. Nobody else was injured. The identity of the dogs&#039; owner had not been confirmed by police Thursday night. McClay said the dogs were not wearing tags. He added that the investigation will determine if any of Dalton&#039;s animal codes were violated and police would respond accordingly. A resident of the apartment where the victim lives said the dogs had not attacked anyone before that she knows of, but the owners had moved in recently so she didn&#039;t know much about them. She declined to give her name, but said the dogs had been known to charge at the door when someone was walking by. &quot;I definitely worried about them,&quot; she said. &quot;They made me nervous.&quot; This attack comes exactly four months after three dogs attacked a 9-year-old boy in the common hallway of his Pittsfield apartment building on June 11, causing severe injury. One of the dogs was put down, the other two were sent to reside out of state and undergo behavioral training.','http://www.berkshireeagle.com/ci_21753762/dalton-man-seriously-hurt-dog-attack','Unknown','animal control Mike McClay - shooter, police officer John Thibodeau, police officer Matt Mozzi','1','0',1,1,0,2,2,'Uniform',1,2,0,0,0,0),(1552,'2013-08-12','South Carolina','Bennettsville','Bennettsville Police Department',1,50,0,'Labrador, police K9','From the Associated Press: A Bennettsville police officer has been suspended without pay for two months after his police dog died in a car of heat stroke.

And on Thursday -- the day before Chavez-Casler was attacked -- Erie police shot a pit bull that charged an officer on Erie&#039;s lower east side. It was the seventh aggressive dog, including four pit bulls, police have shot in 2007. Two pit bulls died.[...] The stray dog that police shot Thursday was taken to the nonprofit Association for Needy and Neglected Animals, the citys contracted animal shelter. The manager of the shelter, Kris Watkins, euthanized the badly injured dog by administering a shot of Fatal-Plus, a veterinarian solution. The stray was one of three pit bulls Watkins put down Thursday. She said the other two, also strays, were too aggressive to adopt out. The A.N.N.A. Shelter, 1555 E. 10th St., does not euthanize animals that the shelters behavioral tests show are suitable for adoption. Watkins said pit bulls are the most common breed found in the shelter, with 154 in 2006 and 159 so far this year. But the shelter puts up only about 10 pit bulls up for adoption a year, Watkins said. The rest are either returned to their owners, or, if the owner cant be located, they are euthanized. Most of them are too aggressive, and we dont know their backgrounds, Watkins said. As she talked, she walked by a little black pit bull in a cage. The dog jumped to lick Watkins finger. She stopped to pet him. He wiggled happily under her touch, angling for more attention. Hes as sweet as can be with people, Watkins said. But hes dog-aggressive. Another dog was led by the black pit bulls cage. The change in the pit bulls behavior was immediate. He snarled and jumped at the chain link fence, his teeth bared and his tail down. He wanted to fight. People ask us why we cant adopt dogs like that out to families with no other dogs, Watkins said. But what happens when he does see a dog on a walk? Or what happens when they take him to the beach and let him off-leash and he kills someone elses dog? Its just not responsible to adopt a dog out like that. Sometimes that behavior is instinctive, Watkins said. After all, pit bulls were originally bred to fight other dogs. Other times, Watkins said, training augments the instinct. She said she believes dogfighting is more common in Erie than people think. One of the other pit bulls she euthanized Thursday had deep scarring on his back and face. The marks are evidence of dogfighting, she said. We get them looking like that a lot, Watkins said. Its happening now more than ever. These dogs are being used as weapons and then theyre discarded. We rarely get people who come in to claim a lost pit bull.','http://www.goerie.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071023/NEWS02/710230387/-1/NEWS','Unknown','Unknown','2','0',2,2,2,2,2,'Uniform',2,2,2,2,2,2),(1555,'2014-09-27','Delaware','Newark','Newark Police Department',1,2,1,'Unconfirmed','From the Associated Press: Delaware authorities say an 8-year-old girl received life-threatening injuries when she was mauled by her family&#039;s pit bull.

Police said officer Evan Weaver was bitten on the face and hand and was taken to Lehigh Valley Hospital-Cedar Crest. An emergency-room representative said Saturday night Weaver was being sutured and was expected to be released. A second man, who was identified by his father as Curt Silfies of N. Eighth Street, was bitten on the arm and leg by the dog, described by witnesses as a large white pit bull. Ray Silfies said he was told his son&#039;s injuries were not severe. Gerry Saemmer of Cedar Street said the dog had been running loose in the neighborhood of Eighth and Cedar streets all day, but had not shown any aggression. &quot;I called the police at about 10 or 10:30 [a.m.] and they told me they couldn&#039;t get anyone out here until 4 [p.m.]&quot; Saemmer said he tried to contain the dog in his backyard, but had to let it go when it jumped his fence. Later, Saemmer said he saw Silfies following the dog. Another witness said the dog bit Silfies&#039; leg and then continued up the street, with Silfies following. Weaver arrived at about 4:30 p.m, witnesses said, and was able to lure the dog into a cruiser using a leash Saemmer had lent him. Witnesses said the dog was friendly toward the officer and Saemmer said he fed him treats before leading him to the cruiser. A short while later, a police department van arrived and Weaver lead the dog from the cruiser into the van. As the officer tried to retrieve Saemmer&#039;s leash, the dog lunged and bit him in the face. The driver of the van, officer Joseph Ianetta, fired at the animal hitting it once, but the animal stayed up. A second shot killed it, Saemmer said. &quot;He didn&#039;t have a choice,&quot; he said. &quot;The dog was facing him and it looked ferocious at that point.&quot; But many of Saemmer&#039;s neighbors disagreed with his assessment of the danger, saying the dog had been around all day without causing any problems. &quot;They shot that dog when there were a whole bunch of people and kids outside,&quot; said East Cedar Street resident Miranda Rodriguez. &quot;What if they had hit on of those kids?&quot; Chief of Investigations Ron Manescu said the officer made a judgment call in firing on the dog. &quot;A pit bull isn&#039;t anything to mess with. The officer made a judgment call and he exercised the best judgment he could under the circumstances,&quot; Manescu said. Manescu said the dog was wearing a 2007 Lehigh County license, but did not release the name of the owner. Manescu said police would investigate the shooting to determine if Ianetta was justified in killing the dog and would determine if charges against the owner of the dog are warranted.','http://articles.mcall.com/2008-05-04/news/4070413_1_pit-bull-police-officer-dog-bite-prevention-tips','Unknown','Evan Weaver, Joseph Ianetta - shooter','1','0',1,1,0,2,2,'Uniform',3,3,2,0,2,0),(1559,'2014-11-11','Washington','Omak','Omak City Police Department',3,2,0,'Unconfirmed','OMAK, Wash. &mdash; An Omak police officer shot and killed a dog after the pitbull lunged at him, grabbing his forearm and tearing his shirt.
