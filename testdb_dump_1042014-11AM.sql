He was standing in the driveway talking to another friend when Redwood City “Task Force” drove by the house.  They took notice of the men talking and recognized one of them.  They made a U-turn and got out of their vehicle with a very aggressive approach which startled him.  Since the Task Force drive around in an unmarked car the gentleman was confused and wasn’t sure who was approaching as such, so he fled down the driveway to the back gated yard in which our dogs are keep safely.  The police ran after him and entered the yard.  I heard the commotion and quickly ran out my room.  I heard my dog barking so I rushed to the back yard only to be stopped by the police. They had the man obtained as they were handcuffing him.  They would not let me through.  I saw my dog through the doorway and he was just staying in one place barking at the policeman across the yard from him.  At that moment I heard four gunshots.  My dog then fell to the ground.  I started screaming, I wanted to go see if he was alright.  They hurried me out to the other side of the fenced yard. He was out of my sight.  I was completely panicked and keep insisting for them to let me go to him.  Finally an officer came to me and yelled “your dog is dead!!”. They still would not let me see him.  They held me back with force.  It was at least 30 minutes before they finally let me see him, then they told my friend to take me away from the house.  When I was leaving they were also taking the man away (under arrest).  I yelled at him “they killed my dog!!!!”.  The police kept telling me the reason the dog was shot was because of that man.  They said that he had a warrant. A few days later, that man came to my house.  I didn’t want to see him, for I felt it was his fault, I was mad that he could come to my home with that pending situation of an out-standing warrant.  I felt that he brought the trouble to my home. \r\n\r\nI have found that the man had no warrant, in fact he wasn’t even on probation or parole.  He had a past history, but since has changed his lifestyle and has lived free of any criminal activity for several years.  The charges he received that day were “Trespassing” (on my property) and “Evading a police officer”.  He said that while he was at the station getting processed that the police man-handled him and told him that he should “move out of town”.  He had been harassed and actually arrested twice since this incident.\r\n\r\nI don’t understand this at all.  How can the police come on my property, chase an innocent man who was scared because of their approach, and shoot my dog from 22 feet away,  not once, but four times?  They didn’t even let anyone have a chance to put him away. All “Buddy” was doing was protecting our home.  The policeman said that he had to hold a lawn chair up to keep him from getting to him.  The lawn chair he was speaking about is made of solid wood.  It is too big and heavy, even for a strong man to hold with one arm and manage a loaded gun.  When in fact the lawn chair never was moved.  The imprints in the lawn were still under the legs of the chair.  The pillow that sits on the chair was also still sitting in place.  If he had picked up that chair the cushion would have fallen off. There is no way that with all the chaos going on could he have perfectly set that chair down in the exact same place as before.  The officer was right next to two huge redwood trees with enormous trunks.  He could have easily run for cover behind one of those trees.  Better yet he could have climbed over the fence without any problems.  There were many alternatives he could have done.  Buddy was not going after him.  My roommate was also right there.  She is a dog handler/trainer.  She has tons of experience handling dogs. She is also certified animal health technician, with knowledge of handling emergency situations with dogs.  She told the police this, and yet they still would not let her even go see if Buddy was still alive.  There was nobody there who checked to see if he had truly passed. This was just an assumption from an inexperienced police officer. A man that has no right to tell me anything in regards to my dog’s condition.  Buddy was rushed to the vet. His body was still warm. He passed when he was at the vet. He was shot through the spine, neck and abdomen. There was one casing that was never found.','http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:NsCvwI10zsgJ:redwoodcity-woodside.patch.com/blog_posts/police-shoot-and-kill-family-pet-059fc4f2+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us','Buddy','Unknown','0','0',0,0,0,'1','1','Plain Clothes','0','2','2','2','2','2'),(4,'2012-12-06','California','Whittier','Pico Rivera Sheriffs',1,30,1,'Pit Bull','On December 6, 2012, in the City of Pico Rivera, a Pet Pit Bull named Chico Blue was playing in his yard.

She said police told her that when they arrived, they tried to go through her backyard to get to the burglary-in-progress. They say they shook the fence to alert any dogs and heard nothing. But when the officer jumped into the yard, he saw a dog charging at him. In a statement, police said, The officer felt he was in danger of great bodily injury and fired one time at the dog. The dog was transported to a nearby animal hospital, and was later released to the owner. Police never caught the burglars. Cuevas said she understands that the officer felt threatened, but she questioned why they didnt let her know first that they needed to enter her yard. If they would have just called me, I would have helped them out, she said. Cuevas said a police officer stopped by on Thursday to give her instructions on how to seek reimbursement from the city.

All of sudden I heard him say, get your dog, and then the next statement was get your dog, and then he just pulled out his gun and shot twice, says Dezengo. Colonel was rushed to an emergency vet. Five hours of surgery saved his life. As for the officer who shot at Colonel, Al, his wife, Barbara, and Morgan said (and witnesses confirmed in TV reports) that he calmly finished writing the ticket, as if nothing out of the ordinary had occurred. While FOX 32\'s Larry Yellen was interviewing the dog\'s owners three days after the shooting, two police officers drove by the home. 90 minutes later, they came back, asked why Phillips why he had contacted the media and gave him a ticket for not keeping Colonel on a leash.

Owner is Brittany Preston. Owner\'s attorney is Chris Olson. Preston sued the city of St. Clair Shores, police officers David Jacquemain and Jeremy Moskwa, and animal control officer Tom Massey. The lawsuit alleges that in killing Lexie, the defendants violated Preston\'s Fourth Amendment rights and her civil rights. The events leading up to the shooting began in the early morning hours of Nov. 22 when Preston\'s grandfather, who reportedly suffers from dementia, accidentally left the dog outside. Authorities were called to the scene when the dog began to bark excessively. Much of what happened next was captured by dash cams on the responding police cruisers. Before even getting out of the car, an officer is heard saying The only thing Im gonna do is shoot it, anyway. I do not like dogs. Subsequent dash camera audio captured the officers discussing various methods of restraining the dog, at which point one of them can be heard saying, I don\'t do snares, I dont do dogs ... Ill shoot the fking thing. Authorities eventually make contact with Preston\'s grandfather. He initially states he does not know who the dog belongs to. Hey, here is what I\'m gonna tell you, if this isnt your dog, then you don\'t care if I shoot it because I\'m about to, an officer can be heard telling Preston\'s grandfather. Im very close to killing this dog, do you understand what Im telling you right now? I will kill this dog. So if this is your damn dog, bring it in the house. However, before Preston\'s grandfather could allow Lexie inside, the police officers shot at her four times, with three bullets making contact, according to police. Preston\'s grandfather can be heard on the dash cam audio confronting one of the police officers about the shooting. What the f--k, you shooting it right in front of me, he asked. The officer replied, It attacked us, sir, to which Preston\'s grandfather replied, I don\'t think so. You guys ought to go on TV. A short time later, an officer shot Lexie a fourth time. The dog can be heard crying out in pain again, but is still alive. The lawsuit alleges that when the animal control officer finally arrived on the scene, the officers can be heard on the dash cam video discussing with him how to deal with Lexie, who is still breathing despite her multiple wounds. Defendant police officers asked defendant Massey if he could choke it out, the lawsuit alleges. Another police officer suggested using a shovel to kill Lexie. Defendant Massey remarked that doing so would not be a good idea because, You know this s--t is going to be all over Facebook in about an hour, to which a police officer responded, yeah, unfortunately. The dash cam later captures Massey using a catch-pole to walk a badly wounded Lexie to the animal control truck. What happened next is also controversial, according to Olson. The lawsuit alleges a licensed veterinarian performed a gross necropsy on Lexie on Nov. 29. The findings allegedly contrast with the number of shots police say were fired at the scene. The necropsy, according to Olson, identified a total of 15 bullet holes in the dog. You do the math, he said. Evidently, based on the number of bullet holes, they shot Lexie several more times once she was taken away.','http://www.freep.com/assets/freep/pdf/C4222331718.PDF','Lexie','police officers David Jacquemain and Jeremy Moskwa animal control officer Tom Massey','1','0',0,0,0,'0','2','Uniform','3','3','1','0','1','0'),(39,'2014-07-24','Georgia','Unincorporated DeKalb County','Dekalb County Police',1,50,0,'German Shepherd 9yo','Tim Theall owner.

However, responding officers were unable to locate the two dogs, which were said to be pit bulls. Later on Monday, officers responded at about 5:30 p.m. to the 700 block of South Norwood Avenue on a report of a vicious dog. Ashley said several people indicated two dogs — one a pit bull and the other an unknown mix — had been chasing people throughout the neighborhood. Officers spoke with a woman who lives at 6300 E. Fifth Place. The woman said she didn’t own the dogs, which were in her backyard. However, Ashley said, she wanted them out of her yard. The dogs aggressively barked at officers and showed their teeth, Ashley said. The officers split up, he said, and each dog charged one of the officers. The two fired shots, dropping one dog immediately. The other was hit and began to run off, Ashley said, so officers fired and struck it again out of concern it would attack someone. It wasn’t immediately known if the dogs in the two instances were the same ones. The dog bite victim declined to be taken by EMSA for medical care.

Holst of Sonny Boy Lane, whose 5-year-old German shepherd, Jake, was killed by a single shot after the deputy reported that the animal lunged at him. &quot;We called them because we didn&#039;t want to lose an animal and it turned into a catastrophe,&quot; Holst said. Family members contend that Jake was shot when he wasn&#039;t a threat, but was hunkered down holding his ground 10 feet away. The deputy reported that the dog, which weighed more than 80 pounds, was only two feet away from him, snarling, barking and about to strike. &quot;At approximately two feet, I had no choice but to discharge my service weapon to protect myself from being bitten by the K-9,&quot; Deputy Michael Buenting wrote in his incident report. &quot;The K-9 received one wound to the top of the head and immediately fell to the ground.&quot; A Sheriff&#039;s Office spokesman said all signs point to the deputy following proper protocol, firing in response to danger and when an attack became imminent. &quot;We didn&#039;t see where he did anything wrong,&quot; said sheriff&#039;s Maj. John Clark, who added that the investigation is ongoing and will include an internal-affairs examination of the shooting site. Clark also confirmed that Sheriff Al Cannon met with family members Tuesday to hear their concerns. The incident unfolded May 25 after Gretchen Holst called the Sheriff&#039;s Office for help. The family had been having an ongoing problem with a neighboring family allowing its dog to get inside of the Holsts&#039; electric fence. &quot;They were careful to inform the Sheriff&#039;s Department that their call was not an emergency,&quot; said Mike Gruenloh, the family&#039;s attorney. The primary concern was the family&#039;s two adult German shepherds -- Jake and Sasha -- and their recent litter, Gruenloh said. Buenting arrived about 20 minutes after the family called, Gruenloh said.\r\nAccording to Buenting&#039;s incident report, he drove into the driveway of the Holsts&#039; three-acre property, where he saw a man escorting three large dogs to the backyard. A woman later identified as the dogs&#039; owner, Gretchen Holst, was holding her hands up in the direction of the deputy. After the dogs were out of sight, Buenting reported, he got out of his cruiser and prepared to speak with Gretchen Holst. He then saw one of the large German shepherds running toward him &quot;viciously barking.&quot; &quot;Several times Holst yelled at the K-9 to stop as the responding deputy backed up toward his patrol vehicle,&quot; the report states. The deputy gave several &quot;stop&quot; commands, as well, but the dog came &quot;extremely close&quot; and continued to bark viciously, the deputy wrote. He drew his service weapon and repeated his halt commands.\r\nThe dog continued approaching, snarling aggressively, he wrote. That&#039;s when Buenting said he fired. The family&#039;s version, as relayed by Gruenloh, is that Gretchen Holst tried to signal Buenting to wait in his patrol car while her son was putting away the family pets so the family could talk to the deputy about the problem with the neighbor. &quot;Unfortunately, he continued to drive directly up to the family&#039;s house and exited his vehicle before the family had a chance to put Jake and Sasha safely in the back,&quot; Gruenloh said. Jake reportedly became startled by Buenting&#039;s cruiser radio, Gruenloh said, and circled back, barking at the deputy.\r\n&quot;While Mrs. Holst was moving forward to secure Jake, Deputy Buenting drew his pistol and fired a single shot into the head of the family&#039;s pet, killing it,&quot; Gruenloh&#039;s account said. &quot;It was just a senseless, unnecessary use of force,&quot; Gretchen Holst said. &quot;It cost us something very dear to us. Jake&#039;s not there to greet us in the driveway every day. And I was within 18 inches of the officer when he fired the shot.&quot; Her husband said he thinks the deputy panicked and used poor judgment.\r\nGruenloh took issue with the deputy&#039;s version of the shooting. He said witnesses reported that the dog was as much as 10 feet away when it was shot. &quot;Jake was hunkered down on his back legs, holding his ground and doing exactly what he was supposed to do, barking at a stranger,&quot; Gruenloh said.\r\nAn autopsy performed by the family&#039;s veterinarian found that Jake was shot in the top of the head, Gruenloh said. &quot;Had the dog been advancing on the officer it is more likely that its head would have been up in an attacking position rather than down.&quot; Buenting remains on duty after the shooting, and that is one of several points Gruenloh said the family wants addressed by the Sheriff&#039;s Office. They also want deputies to be better trained on how to respond to animal issues, and they want compensation for their loss.v&quot;I think the officer used very poor judgment,&quot; E.L. Holst said. &quot;I am heartbroken, devastated over what I&#039;ve lost.&quot;','http://www.postandcourier.com/news/2011/jun/02/fatal-shooting-of-dog-by-deputy-investigated/','Jake','Michael Buenting','2','0',0,0,0,'0','2','Uniform','3','2','0','0','2','0'),(86,'2014-06-14','Maryland','Baltimore','Baltimore City Police Department',1,50,0,'Shar Pai','Jeffrey Bolger, Baltimore City police officer, was arrested and charged with aggravated animal cruelty and other charges after cutting the throat of a dog, police officials announced Wednesday afternoon. Police were called Saturday morning to the 700 block of South Grundy Street in southeast Baltimore for a report of a stray dog that had nipped someone trying to rescue it. Sarah Gossard told 11 News that her beloved 7-year-old shar-pei named Nala had somehow escaped the gate of her back yard that morning. While she searched for the dog, including posting pictures of Nala on a community Facebook page, nearby resident Sandy Fleischer said she found Nala a few blocks away looking confused and thirsty. &ldquo;The dog was more scared of not knowing where it was and being thirsty and disoriented. The dog bit me out of fear because I tried to touch it, which was my fault,&rdquo; Fleischer told 11 News reporter Kai Reed. Police were called, and Fleischer said she watched as several officers used sticks to try to contain Nala, who she said wasn&rsquo;t being aggressive. &ldquo;You could hear the dog screaming and crying in pain,&rdquo; Fleischer said. &ldquo;I did see one officer that had been extremely aggressive that did have his knee into her chest that was tightening the noose. It seemed (they were doing it) relentlessly and unnecessarily.&rdquo; Fleischer then went into an ambulance, so she didn&rsquo;t see what happened next. Police said the officers then secured Nala using a dog pole, and an officer assigned to the emergency services division, later identified as Officer Jeffrey Bolger, went much further. &ldquo;Unfortunately, at some point after the dog was contained, one of our officers used a knife and cut the dog&rsquo;s throat. This is outrageous and an unacceptable breach of our protocol,&rdquo; Baltimore Police Deputy Commissioner Dean Palmere said. &ldquo;We have no words to describe this. To say that we are appalled at the allegations, I think, is an understatement,&rdquo; said Baltimore Police Deputy Commissioner Jerry Rodriguez. Commanders said they know of no reason for Bolger to use such force on a dog that was under control. Nala later died. &ldquo;She was just the sweetest dog and would never hurt anyone. She was just scared that day, and through all of those events &mdash; being scared and lost, thirsty, hungry &mdash; yes I&rsquo;m very sure that she bit someone, but the actions after that were not OK,&rdquo; Gossard said. She told 11 News she didn&rsquo;t find out until Wednesday that her dog was killed in such a violent way. &ldquo;This dog had a collar around its neck with tags, with my phone number. It&rsquo;s not OK,&rdquo; Gossard said. Bolger, who was also charged with malfeasance in office, has been suspended without pay. He was released early Thursday on his own personal recognizance, 11 News learned Obviously, my anger is toward this police officer. I don&rsquo;t want him to have his job. I don&rsquo;t want him to be able to go out on calls and react like that to a person, to a dog, to anything. That&rsquo;s not OK,&rdquo; Gossard said. Police are also investigating whether other officers who knew of the incident followed procedure to report it. Commanders said they &ldquo;caught wind of it Monday,&rdquo; two days later. Bolger has been with Baltime PD since 1992. Following Bolgers arrest, Thomas Schmidt, 52, of Abingdon, was also arrested, charged and released Thursday in the case. According to charging documents, Schmidt is accused of holding down the dog while the other officer, Jeffrey Bolger, killed it.','http://www.wbaltv.com/news/police-dogs-throad-cut-officer-charged-with-animal-cruelty/26553714#!0Zozx','Nala','Jeffrey Bolger and Thomas Schmidt','1','0',0,0,0,'0','0','Uniform','0','3','1','2','2','1'),(88,'2013-06-30','California','Hawthorne','Hawthorne Police Department',1,100,0,'Rottweiler','Victim Max 2 year old Rottweiler. Leon Cordell Rosby, a 52-year-old man from Hawthorne, Calif., was walking his dog &ldquo;Max&rdquo; while watching a police response to a robbery on June 30. The California man was videotaping the showdown with his cell phone. Police accused him of disturbing the crime scene, and a video of the incident quickly went viral, garnering millions of views. As three officers approached him, Rosby put his Rottweiler in his car and allowed the police to apprehend him. But while he was being arrested, the dog jumped from an open car window, ran toward the officers and barked at them. One policeman shot the dog four times, causing the writhing Rottweiler to slowly bleed to death on the street. Rosby&rsquo;s knees buckled as he cried out for the dying animal. The incident outraged animal lovers and animal rights activists across the country, and the Hawthorne Police Department received letters of condemnation and death threats. In response, the police department released a second video of the incident, which showed more of the officer&rsquo;s actions before he shot the dog. More of Rosby&rsquo;s taunts to police could also be heard in the clip. After the release of that video, Rosby allegedly went to the home of the witness who recorded it and &ldquo;verbally confronted&rdquo; her and her son, police told KTLA. Now, Rosby is facing additional charges for his reaction, and is being held until his court date. Despite the public outcry against the actions of the officers, Rosby was on Tuesday charged with two counts of intimidating a witness, two counts of dissuading a witness from prosecuting a crime, and two counts of making criminal threats &ndash; all six of which are felonies. He was also charged with one misdemeanor count of resisting arrest. Mark Geragos, the attorney representing Rosby, told KTLA that police are trying to cover up the fact that they killed the Rottweiler by instead focusing on the wrongdoings of the defendant. &ldquo;The videos have shown that these cops killed this dog for absolutely no reason,&rdquo; Geragos said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s precisely why the cops now are scrambling to try to get him convicted, get him into custody and do anything else in order to try and turn the spotlight away from their actions.&rdquo; Rosby has sued the city of Hawthorne for the killing.

A neighbor called 911 just after noon to report the dog was out, but did not say it was posing a threat to anyone. Police arrived at the Wrights home one hour later to find Rosie sitting in her owners&rsquo; driveway.

He&rsquo;s going to fight like a (expletive) once he&rsquo;s tased.

Officers are then heard saying &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just go shoot her.&rdquo; The dog then ran into a neighbor&rsquo;s fully fenced yard where officers shot her 4 times with an assault rifle.The owner of the property Rosie ran into has said &ldquo;If I would of known what was going on I would of told the officers to leave.

The Wrights say Rosie never bit anyone and had never been declared vicious or dangerous or violated any animal control regulation.

A witness followed the suspect to the area on Wiley Street and called 911. &quot;The police suspected the robber may have gone into the back yard so they entered through a side gate. &quot;When they got to the back yard, they were confronted by a pit bull,&quot; said Hollywood Police Sgt. Lester Cochenour.\r\nThe dog was shot multiple times and died in the back yard. Williamson was angry that officers didn&#039;t knock first. He said Pup-pup was a humble dog and was great with kids, but was also trained to protect to his property. &quot;There have been a lot of break ins around here, in this area for the last year and a half or so, and I have my dog out here just for that purpose,&quot; Williamson told Local 10&#039;s Roger Lohse. Lohse reported that there are no signs on the side of Williamson&#039;s house indicating that a dog was in the backyard. Under the law, police are allowed to enter private property if they are pursuing or searching for a felony suspect.','http://www.local10.com/news/Hollywood-police-searching-for-robber-shoot-kill-dog/-/1717324/16749718/-/emiqfx/-/index.html','Pup-pup','Unknown','1','0',0,0,0,'0','0','Uniform','0','0','0','0','2','0'),(92,'2012-09-21','North Carolina','Fayetteville','Fayetteville Police Department',1,30,0,'Mixed Breed','Victim 5 year old mixed breed. A family whose dog was shot when Fayetteville police raided their Clarendon Street home on Wednesday morning has filed a complaint against the officers. Department spokesman Gavin MacRoberts said the incident remained under investigation Friday. MacRoberts said it is standard procedure for the department to conduct an internal investigation of complaints regarding uses of force in any police matter. That investigation will look at whether police operated according to department standards. Christian Yepez and his family met with police Friday afternoon to discuss the matter, but MacRoberts said he could not share what was said because it relates to personnel matters. Yepez&#039;s mother, Pennie Yepez, said about 11 people went to the police station Friday afternoon to ask police why the family dog was killed. She said police did not offer much insight as to what happened to lead to the dog&#039;s death and family members left frustrated that their concerns were not being heard. MacRoberts said police entered the home to execute a search warrant as part of an investigation involving Yepez. He said the dog was shot after police entered, but it remained unclear what prompted police to fire on 5-year-old Nastradamus, a medium-sized mixed breed. &quot;Details beyond that are part of the internal investigation and not being released,&quot; MacRoberts said. Yepez was arrested after the raid and charged with misdemeanor possession of marijuana, possession of drug paraphernalia and maintaining a dwelling for controlled substances. MacRoberts said police seized less than 1.5 ounces of marijuana and two guns from the home. Pennie Yepez said she was not home during the raid. Her son was upstairs sleeping when police kicked in the front door about 7 a.m. and threw flash grenades, she said. The dog was sleeping on the couch by the front door, and, after police entered, the dog moved away from the door. &quot;He was in the kitchen and (police) shot him three times,&quot; she said. Pennie Yepez said the family had Nastradamus&#039; body examined by a local veterinarian with x-rays to view the full scope of his injuries. She said there was a visible bullet hole in the dog&#039;s neck, unexplained leg injuries and several broken bones.','http://www.fayobserver.com/articles/2012/09/21/1205829/?sac=fo.local','Nastradamus','Unknown SWAT team','0','0',0,0,0,'1','1','Uniform','1','2','2','2','2','2'),(95,'2013-04-09','South Carolina','Myrtle Beach','Horry County Police Department',1,100,0,'Retriever','Victim Hayden 10 year old retriever. A Myrtle Beach area woman, whose dog was shot and killed by an Horry County police officer, said her dog was not an aggressive animal. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an absolute tragedy and it should have never happened,&rdquo; said Christine Orlando, whose dog, Hayden, a 10-year-old rescue retriever was killed Tuesday morning when police were called to her apartment for a civil dispute. &ldquo;He started nipping at one of the officer&rsquo;s feet. That&rsquo;s what he does. That&rsquo;s his way of saying just back up. Not in a threatening way. He never lunged,&rdquo; Orlando said Thursday morning. &ldquo;He had never done any harm to anyone in his life. He was one of the most amazing animals. He did not need to die.&rdquo; Horry County police were called about 5:15 a.m. Tuesday to an apartment at 913 Marshfield Circle for a civil complaint between two roommates regarding electricity being turned off, according to the report. The dog&rsquo;s owner was arguing with her roommate because he shut off the power to their apartment.\r\nWhen the officer&rsquo;s arrived, one officer knocked on the door and heard a dog barking, according to the report. When the dog owner opened the door, the black retriever, weighing about 100 pounds, charged out into the breezeway and attacked one of the officers, according to the report. The report stated the dog bit the other officer&rsquo;s foot, while he yelled for the woman to get her dog, but the dog continued and ignored &ldquo;any verbal or physical attempts of the complaint to restrain it,&rdquo; according to the report. The officer tried to draw his gun, but was unable to do so because the woman &ldquo;pushed down on his holster,&rdquo; according to the report. Another officer asked the woman to restrain her dog and the dog briefly ran back into the open door of the apartment. Then it ran back out into the breezeway. One of the officers used his gun and shot the dog once in the head, which killed it, according to the report. The officers did not suffer any injuries during the incident and they called Horry County Environmental Services to take the dog for proper disposal. Horry County police Sgt. Robert Kegler said the incident was not under investigation. Orlando disputed the account in the police report and said she argued with her roommate about some money due on Thursday, so he shut off the power to the apartment. Orlando said instead of continuing the argument, she called police. The apartment was dark and Orlando said she was unaware her dog followed her from her bedroom when she went to answer the door for police. Orlando said her dog did not return to the apartment and she did not grab at an officer&rsquo;s gun. &ldquo;There was a lot of yelling involved with the officers, which heightened the circumstance,&rdquo; Orlando said and noted her dog took note of the officer drawing his gun. &ldquo;I immediately acted on impulse and jumped in front of the officer and begged please do not shoot my dog. . . As soon as a he had a clear shot, he shot my dog in the head.&rdquo; Orlando said no blood was drawn and the officer&rsquo;s uniforms were not damaged by her dog nipping at their feet. &ldquo;My dog never returned back into that house. The only time my dog turned to come back into the house was when he came back in to die. I never pushed anybody&rsquo;s gun back into the holster,&rdquo; Orlando said. &ldquo;This is just insane.

There was a puddle of blood on the floor and bullet holes in the door of a bedroom where Prada slept. But it was not a burglar who broke in. Hairston found a search warrant, signed by a judge, issued to the Erie County Sheriff&#039;s Department, on her kitchen floor.

Hairston said she rents another home she owns to Thompson, who dates her daughter, but he does not live in her residence and she has absolutely no connection to his alleged illegal activities. A spokesperson for the sheriff&#039;s office said they had probable cause to search Hairston&#039;s residence because Thompson&#039;s alleged drug activities were suspected to take place from Hairston&#039;s house on occasion. The home which she rents to Thompson was also searched. Deputies were forced to shoot and kill Prada during the raid because he threatened them, the spokesman said.

Patton was shot in front of his owners James Smoak and his wife, Pamela and 17-year-old son Brandon, all of whom were handcuffed and ordered onto their knees. The family was stopped in relationship to a robbery that they had no involvement with. The event was caught on video. The tape shows the Smoaks pleaded with officers to close the doors of their car so their two dogs would not escape, but the officers did not heed them.\r\n\r\nPamela Smoak is seen on the tape looking up at an officer, telling him slowly, &quot;That dog is not mean. He won&#039;t hurt you.&quot;\r\n\r\nHer husband says, &quot;I got a dog in the car. I don&#039;t want him to jump out.&quot; The tape then shows the Smoaks&#039; medium-size brown dog romping on the shoulder of the Interstate, its tail wagging. As the family yells, the dog, named Patton, first heads away from the road, then quickly circles back toward the family.\r\nAn officer in a blue uniform aims his shotgun at the dog and fires at its head, killing it immediately. Patton made no aggressive or furtive movements toward the officer who killed him. A federal court jury in 2008 awarded the family 9K in compensatory damages and 192K in attorneys fees, and the Smoaks settled with the City of Cookeville for 77,500 dollars in a separate lawsuit. After the Smoaks settled with the City of Cookeville, their lawsuit against the THP officers remained. The troopers argued in court that they were entitled to qualified immunity for their actions that day, and though a Tennessee district court denied them that status, they appealed, and a higher court granted it. But the higher court also found that Bush and Trooper Lt. Jerry Andrews did use excessive force against the handcuffed man that day. Since then, the case has been slowly making its way through the appeals court system, and a jury concluded that Andrews did not use excessive force that day, but that Bush did. Bush appealed that decision, and the latest ruling is a denial of that appeal. Noting that a jury has already ruled that Bush used excessive force that day and that essentially, no new evidence to the contrary has been presented, the 6th Circuit ruling says that Bush is asking us to do what the law flatly forbids to substitute our opinion for that of the jury based on a re-weighing and reinterpreting of the evidence.

Jim Mulligan, Fort Myers Police Department. When officers arrived they found a woman screaming someone was in the house with a gun. As they tried to go inside, three large pit bulls rushed them at the door. &quot;One officer, fearing that he was in jeopardy from the dog biting him, drew his weapon and fired one round striking one of the dogs,&quot; Mulligan said. It was a quick decision Mulligan says the officers are trained to make. &quot;He&#039;s there to protect himself the other officers and whoever else if the dog happens to run past him so its about protecting himself first because the dog is bearing down on him and he doesn&#039;t want to get hurt,&quot; Mulligan said. We tried the residence to see if anyone would talk to us about what happened, but no one was home. In the end, officers arrested the man they found inside the house. Officers say he was carrying a loaded gun and he was later Baker Acted. After he was taken into custody he told cops his dogs were trained to attack. The other two dogs are now with Lee County Animal Services. Officials say it&#039;s too early to tell their temperaments. The shelter will be their new home until they can be evaluated and possibly put up for adoption. We looked up some stats on how often Fort Myers officers discharge their weapons. We found between 2009 and 2011 the department totaled 15 shooting incidents --with only eight of those being against animals. The shelter will take ownership of the dogs after five days if no one comes to claim them.','http://www.nbc-2.com/story/22125048/fort-myers-police-shoot-kill-attacking-dog#.U_8_QPldXW4','Unknown','Two Unknown Police','1','0',0,0,0,'1','2','Uniform','2','2','2','2','2','2'),(116,'2014-01-20','Florida','Merritt Island','Brevard County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department ',1,50,1,'Pit Bull','A Merritt Island family is looking for answers Monday after they say a Brevard County Sheriff&#039;s deputy shot and killed their family dog.

When the deputy arrived, witnesses said the deputy walked up to the home with his gun drawn and fired two shots at Brownie, feet from where they 2-year-old boy was sitting in his stroller. &quot;The dog&#039;s first thought is hey you&#039;re walking up to me with a gun and the dog growls.

The incident was witnessed by numerous bystanders, some of whom questioned the lethal tactics taken by police. The animal barked and growled when approached but attacked no one, they said. &quot;To me &mdash; I felt like it was scared more than anything,&quot; said Randy Schamber, an employee of the Hager Parking Lot where the incident occurred around 4:30 p.m.\r\n&quot;I feel like (police) could&#039;ve done more to catch the dog. I don&#039;t understand why they had to shoot it.&quot; Police, however, said the animal was shot only after all other efforts had failed. Officers tried placing a snare around the dog&#039;s neck and attempted to subdue the animal with a Taser. Both efforts failed and only seemed to make the animal more agitated, Sgt. Bill Hickey said Wednesday night.\r\n&quot;In that moment, the officer felt he wasn&#039;t able to control the situation and believed the dog to be a danger,&quot; Hickey added. He declined to release the name of the officer, stating that an internal review will be conducted to determine if the use of force was justified. Hickey said police responded to the West King Street lot for a report of a loose dog that had chased people and another dog.\r\nWitnesses said the animal didn&#039;t go after anyone. They said the white pit bull had jumped from the partially-covered bed of a pickup truck that was parked in the lot. Schamber said the animal and another dog, which one witness said appeared to be a spaniel-type, had been in the back of the truck for at least a half-hour. He said the animals got his attention because the white dog would bark when people walked by the vehicle. After jumping from the truck, the pit bull ran toward a man who had just gotten out of an SUV with his dog. The pit bull ran up to the man&#039;s dog but didn&#039;t attack the animal, Schamber said. The man, who lives nearby, scooped up his medium-sized dog and placed it back in his vehicle, inside a dog crate. The pit bull then jumped in the back of the SUV as well.\r\n&quot;Not necessarily at (my dog), just jumped in the car &mdash; but if you tried to get close to him he&#039;d growl. But I think by this time the dog is really confused,&quot; the resident, who asked that his name not be used, said. &quot;We tried to get him out of the car,&quot; said Schamber. &quot;I keep dog treats in the booth so I ran over and got some to try to coax him out.&quot; The dog jumped from the vehicle, only to bark and growl at the men.\r\nThat&#039;s when Schamber called police.\r\n&quot;The Fulton (Theater) was letting out and there were elderly people walking through the lot. (The dog) hadn&#039;t gone after anyone but I didn&#039;t want to risk the possibility,&quot; he said. For the next several minutes, until police arrived, the animal went back and forth from his owner&#039;s truck to the resident&#039;s SUV.\r\n&quot;He couldn&#039;t get back in his own truck but it seemed like he wanted to,&quot; Schamber said. &quot;He would keep walking over and looking up. Then he&#039;d go over and jump in the back of the other car again.&quot; The dog was in the back of the resident&#039;s SUV when police arrived.\r\n&quot;He&#039;s not scowling or growling but this one cop has a rifle and he&#039;s threatening to shoot that white dog next to (the resident&#039;s) dog in the back of the car,&quot; according to Meredith Wilterdink, who works at the nearby Carr&#039;s Restaurant.\r\nThe resident refused to allow the officer to fire, refusing the officer&#039;s command to move away from the car, Wilterdink said. Police eventually placed the resident in handcuffs but he later was released with no charges filed. The pit bull eventually jumped from the SUV at which time police unsuccessfully tried to subdue the animal with a Taser. Moments later, according to Schamber, a shot rang out.\r\n&quot;The dog was running around yelping, and then a second shot,&quot; Schamber said as his eyes welled with tears. &quot;I don&#039;t understand why they had to shoot him; he didn&#039;t hurt anybody.&quot; &quot;He didn&#039;t need to be shot,&quot; the resident said adamantly. &quot;What he needed was to be tethered and maybe tranquilized. But shot ... no.&quot;\r\nRegarding the use of a tranquilizer gun, Hickey said he wasn&#039;t sure if city police still had one. &quot;In the past I believe we did. That said, it&#039;s something that&#039;s kept under lock and key. It&#039;s not something you grab and go in the heat of the moment.&quot; He also said the department&#039;s dog law officer, who typically would&#039;ve responded to Wednesday&#039;s incident, had gone off duty about 30 minutes prior to the incident. &quot;There were a lot of factors here &mdash; rush hour in downtown, a busy street, a public parking lot &mdash; that made for an unfortunate outcome,&quot; Hickey said. &quot;We&#039;re dog owners too and nobody takes this sort of thing lightly. &quot;Yes, shooting the animal is an option but it&#039;s not the one any of us prefer. It&#039;s a last resort.&quot; The owner of the deceased animal returned to his vehicle after the incident had concluded.

The officer is still on active duty while the deparment conducts an investigation. And the veterinarian who treated the dog recommends leaving the bullet where it lodged. Sgt. Russ Boring with the Springfield Police Department said officers received a 911 call from a resident near 41st and Camellia in Springfield around 6:15 p.m. The caller reported a pit bull acting aggressively in the neighborhood and running around the street unleashed. Boring said the caller told police that the pit bull was acting in a threatening manner towards a young boy. &quot;It was aggressive enough to where there was a gentleman driving down the street who was honking his horn on his car, who placed his car between the dog and the boy, and ended up having the boy get in his car and drove him away from the scene,&quot; Boring said. An officer responded to the scene. According to Boring, the officer tried to coax the dog back into the home where it came from. At first the dog was friendly, Boring said, but then it became more aggressive as the officer tried to get it back on the property. Boring said the pit bull &quot;growled, it snarled, it showed it&#039;s teeth and it became pretty aggressive.&quot; As the dog approached the officer, Boring said the officer believed he was in danger. &quot;He had to make a decision right there,&quot; he said. &quot;I don&#039;t think a Taser would have been effective with this aggressive behavior and this dog. I mean, he felt that he was going to be attacked.&quot; The officer shot the dog once in the head as other officers responded. &quot;The dog was basically at his feet when he shot the dog,&quot; he said. The dog survived. Breonna Kerr, Kiki&#039;s owner, said the dog is a rescue, and they&#039;ve had it since it was a puppy. The family was out for dinner when a friend called Kerr and otld her the dog broke free from its chain in the backyard and was loose. &quot;I pulled in my driveway and there were 5 or 6 cop cars,&quot; Kerr recalled, &quot;and my dog was cornered in my driveway and she had blood, like a gunshot to her head.&quot; \r\nPolice and Kerr took Kiki to the vet. The veterinarian who treated Kiki called where the bullet lodged &quot;somewhat of a miracle for this dog.&quot; Kiki didn&#039;t have a heavy active hemmorage and was discharged as stable patient who had received treatment, said Dr. Meg Schneck with the Emergency Veterinary Hospital.\r\nThe hospital donated services for treatment of the dog prior to discharge on Tuesday, she said. Schneck explained that she wouldn&#039;t propose surgery to remove the bullet. She said her &quot;recommendation is to leave it alone.&quot;\r\nTo remove the bullet, Schneck said a vet would have to use a bone saw and cut into fragile structures in the dog&#039;s head. Even leaving the bullet in place, she recommended antibiotics and pain medications. Kerr said her family doesn&#039;t have the money for Kiki&#039;s care. &quot;There&#039;s a chance that she could have to be put down or die from it,&quot; she said. \r\nKerr said they understand police officers need to protect themselves, but the family thinks the force was a little too excessive. &quot;People said she was trying to get back inside.

East Peoria Police shot and killed that dog, Bella, an eight-year-old pit bull last week. The dog allegedly attacked two people and charged at an officer. Now more than 2,500 people have signed a petition demanding justice for the dog. &ldquo;She loved people. She loved attention. She was a really happy dog,&rdquo; said dog owner Shane Ellis. That&rsquo;s how Shane Ellis described Bella, his pit bull that was shot and killed by an East Peoria Police officer August 21st. He and a friend started a Facebook page and an online petition calling for an investigation of the shooting. &ldquo;I hope we get justice. Cause I do not think it&#039;s right.&rdquo; Police didn&#039;t want to talk about the issue on camera, but according to their report, here&#039;s what happened. On the afternoon of August 21st an East Peoria officer responded to a call of two dogs running loose in the Quail Trail area. The officer found two people- one limping and one bleeding from the leg- saying they were bit by a dog. He was told both dogs belong to Ellis so he parked outside the owner&#039;s home and waited for animal control. The two pit bulls returned as he was questioning one of the bite victims. They circled the officer before heading towards Ellis&#039;s home. That&#039;s when a neighbor, two doors up the road, walked out of his house and headed towards his car. The Police Report says one of the dogs, Bella, started walking toward the neighbor. After the officer yelled at the neighbor to &quot;watch out&quot; the dog turned toward the officer, growled and started running at him. Bella got less than 10-yards from the officer when he fired those fatal shots. &ldquo;They just got a call and seen my dog and thought it was it.&rdquo; Ellis believes another neighbor&rsquo;s pit bull was responsible for attacking two people, not his dog. &ldquo;I think it was a mistaken identity.&rdquo; But according to police reports, witnesses recognized Bella by a large tumor on her backside. Ellis tells us he secures his dogs behind a chain linked fence. &ldquo;They do occasionally get out, but most generally I guess they&rsquo;re put up,&quot; says another neighbor.And whether it was Bella biting people or not, one neighbor just asks one thing\r\n&ldquo;To see my neighborhood safe. Whether it be from people or animals&rdquo; Ellis says he would also like Bella&rsquo;s remains returned. We spoke to the Tazewell County Animal control.They say they are inspecting Bella for rabies and it&rsquo;s their standard procedure to not return the dog when that happens.The Police Report indicates that Ellis was cooperative with the officer after the incident.

James Clark says he plans to file a formal complaint against the two police officers who were captured on video using force on his two barking dogs. Clark told the station he wasn&#039;t home when one of his Labrador retrievers, Max, got out of his yard and was reported to be chasing children at a nearby school. When officers arrived, a neighbor captured one of them on video shooting Max with a bean bag. &quot;My heart broke. My heart still breaks every time I hear him whimper,&quot; Clark said. &quot;You know, it&#039;s like my son here falling and getting hurt.&quot; Police say the video only tells part of the story. &quot;The officers acted very appropriately. They kept that dog from hurting them,&quot; West Covina police Lt. Ken Plunkett said, according to the station. Because the camera is so shaky, only the audio of the bean-bag shot going off can be heard, he said. The video viewer does not show the moments leading up to it. &quot;At that point, that&#039;s when the dog became aggressive and charged at him,&quot; Lt. Plunkett said. Witnesses, however, say the dogs were not being as aggressive as police claim. &quot;He was barking but not like all dramatic,&quot; witness Anna Estrada said, according to the station. &quot; &#039;Ruff, ruff.&#039; Like a dog would bark. It was a normal bark...I think the cop was being more dramatic, calling more attention on himself.&quot; After Max was shot with the bean bag, police say the officers tried to get him back in the yard, where his sister Chloe was barking behind the fence. The video also shows one of the officers using a fire extinguisher on Chloe. While watching the video, the dog owner, Clark points out where the officers use the fire extinguisher. &quot;He sprays her. And now the officers, they can&#039;t breathe themselves,&quot; he said.\r\nAgain, police disagree. &quot;The nozzle wasn&#039;t pointed at the dog and directly shot...in the face,&quot; Lt.

It was a normal day, she said, which involved watching her 5-year-old daughter play behind the house with their dog, as her infant son lied in a playpen inside the house. Ms. Shimburski&rsquo;s parents, John Shimburski and Martha Spaulding, were not at home when the day turned to chaos. At around 2:00 p.m., Ms. Shimburski recalled that she ducked inside the house for a moment to use the restroom. She became alerted to something occurring when the family&rsquo;s two dogs began barking; one was inside and one was outside the house. Ms. Shimburski said that she looked out the window and saw two vehicles parked outside &mdash; a car and an SUV &mdash; along with unidentified men, one of whom had a gun drawn. Panicked, she rushed outside toward danger to attend to her daughter, Makenna, who was accompanied by &ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; a 2-year-old Brindle Pit Bull. The Shimburski family&#039;s &quot;big baby,&quot; called Lady. (Source: Megan Shimburski) The Shimburski family&rsquo;s &ldquo;big baby,&rdquo; called Lady. (Source: Megan Shimburski)\r\n&ldquo;I heard 2 shots fired, and Lady yelp, and my daughter scream,&rdquo; Ms. Shimburski told Police State USA. The armed stranger had just shot the family&rsquo;s beloved pet in the head, with Makenna standing &ldquo;20 feet behind [the dog] in the exact same direction.&rdquo; &ldquo;He then proceeded to continue walking up the hill with his gun raised, and I screamed at him not to shoot his gun again,&rdquo; she added. Ms. Shimburski says that there was no clear indication of who the intruders were; there were no markings on the vehicles and the three men were not in uniforms. She described them as dressed in &ldquo;business attire&rdquo; &mdash; definitely not uniforms. &ldquo;I stated that I was going to call the police, and that&rsquo;s when they said, &lsquo;We are the Erie County Police,&rsquo;&rdquo; Ms. Shimburski recalled. The men began then began to request to enter her parents&rsquo; home. Ms. Shimburski declined, and tended to her children and dogs. Lady was bleeding profusely. Makenna was cowering nearby crying, &ldquo;The man shot Lady. He shot my dog.&rdquo; As Ms. Shimburski took her daughter inside, she discovered that two of the self-described &ldquo;officers&rdquo; had already entered her parents&rsquo; home, after she had explicitly told them to stay out. &ldquo;They were yelling at me to tell my daughter it was OK,&rdquo; she said. The young mom secured her daughter in a bedroom along with the second dog that had been indoors. Her parents quickly arrived after being notified about what had happened. The reason for the intrusion was finally made known when they announced that they were looking for the father of Ms. Shimburski&rsquo;s son. The family told the officers that the man they were seeking had never lived there, didn&rsquo;t receive mail at the address, and that they should have tried looking for him at his own home. The police had not brought a warrant, and said they only wanted to ask the man some questions. They continued to request a search of the home. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to GRAZE her.&rdquo;\r\nMeanwhile Lady, described as a &ldquo;67-pound big baby,&rdquo; was hiding under the deck, covered in blood. A bullet had traveled through the tissue on her head, neck, and shoulder. A large, open gash allowed blood to pour down her face into her eyes and nose. It was a shocking sight for the family. &ldquo;The officer stated that he had just &lsquo;grazed&rsquo; her, and that she would be fine,&rdquo; Ms. Shimburski recalled. &ldquo;I looked at him and said, &lsquo;You did not graze her!!&rsquo; His words were, &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to GRAZE her.&rsquo;&rdquo; The shooter &mdash; [later identified as Erie County Sheriff&#039;s Detective Greg McCarthy] &mdash; claimed he shot in self-defense because the dog was &ldquo;charging and barking.&rdquo; Ms. Shimburski says that he exaggerated the dog&rsquo;s actions and the distance he was standing from her when he fired.  No one was bitten or in danger, she said, and the dog was coming from the back to the front of the house to investigate the strange visitors. &ldquo;My child could have been shot,&rdquo; Ms. Shimburski said to Police State USA. &ldquo;She now has the idea that these people who were there to protect people are bad people,&rdquo; and added that she may need counseling. &ldquo;I stated that not all cops are bad but at this point I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s going to trust them.&rdquo; Lady ultimately survived, after an emergency surgery, 60 metal stitches, and $1,200.00 in veterinarian bills. &ldquo;The police did not leave names or numbers, nor did they show any remorse,&rdquo; Ms. Shimburski said. In fact, she had been left with no paperwork; no business card; no record whatsoever of what had happened. Regardless, the family attempted to get past the incident.  Young Makenna dealt with confused feelings about the shooting and Lady slowly recovered from her injuries at home.  Ms. Shimburski did not even have a confirmed phone number to call regarding the incident.  Until 11 days later&hellip; A &ldquo;Dangerous Animal&rdquo;\r\nThe family found that their troubles were not yet over on August 5th, when police returned for another visit.  This time, they brought paperwork: a document that read &ldquo;Order to Seize Dog.&rdquo; The Erie County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office, unsatisfied that Lady had survived the first encounter, had sought out another legal method of killing her.  Describing Lady as &ldquo;dangerous dog &mdash; pit bull,&rdquo; the document authorized deputies to &ldquo;seize the said dog harbored by the said Megan Shimburski&rdquo; and to &ldquo;hold, care for, or dispose of&rdquo; Lady, pursuant to New York&rsquo;s Agriculture and Markets Law, Article 7, Section 123. The deputy and an animal control officer took Lady away to the animal warden, leaving her with an uncertain fate.  Pending a court date on August 12th, Lady may be euthanized if found to be a &ldquo;dangerous dog.&rdquo; The document was signed by Gene R. Heintz, Justice of the Town of Sardina.  It also confirms that the men at the property on July 25th were Erie County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office detectives Graham, Noecher, and McCarthy.  The man who shot Lady was Detective Greg McCarthy. &ldquo;I am outraged and disgusted by their behavior,&rdquo; Ms. Shimburski said in an interview.  &ldquo;They put my child&rsquo;s life in danger because of their negligence.  Lady did not deserve this in any way because she is not in any way a dangerous or aggressive dog.&rdquo;  Police returned to the residence to seize Lady, the detectives declaring her a dangerous dog and ordering her to be euthanized. At Ladys court hearing, the Judge declared Lady to in fact be dangerous. The ruling forces the family to keep Lady in a muzzle, posts signs at their home warning visitors of Ladys dangerous dog status, and other penalties and requirements. The Shimburski family attorney, Matt Albert, was nearly held in contempt of court after he admittedly mouthed off to the judge because he upset with how the hearing unfolded.','http://www.policestateusa.com/2014/justice-for-lady-erie-county-ny/','Lady','Det Greg McCarthy Det Graham and Det Noecher','1','1',1,0,0,'0','1','Plain Clothes','0','2','2','2','2','2'),(139,'2014-08-27','Kansas','Hutchinson','Hutchinson City Police Department',1,2,1,'Unconfirmed','The following is based entirely on an uncorroborated police statement: Hutchinson police officer shot and killed a pit bull Wednesday that had already bitten another officer and then appeared to charge the officer who shot it.

Two other officers on the scene also drew their weapons and aimed at the dog, but didn&rsquo;t fire. The dog, apparently struck by the first shot, made a wide turn and headed back into the house.

The men were on their way to visit friends in Lake Charles. They climbed into the back of a parked box truck in the near-empty parking lot of the Southwest Daily News to take shelter, Carpenter said. Before long, a police car pulled up and an officer, gun drawn, ordered them out of the truck. The officer, Brian Thierbach of the Sulphur Police Department, spotted Arzy and told the men to &quot;get your dog,&quot; according to Carpenter. He said the officer watched him tie Arzy to a nearby fence with a 3 1/2-foot leash before Thierbach handcuffed both men, ordered them to the ground facing away from Arzy, and asked, &quot;Is this dog going to bite me or attack me?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; Carpenter said he responded. &quot;He is an incredibly friendly dog.&quot; Twenty seconds later, Carpenter told HuffPost, he heard a single shot. Eric Midkiff, Southwest Daily News circulation manager, said his boss phoned him around 7 a.m., asking if he knew anything about the men in the parking lot. Midkiff &quot;took off&quot; and headed to the office, and by the time he arrived, &quot;the officer already had Brandon and the other guy on the ground.&quot; Midkiff, 33, told HuffPost he stayed about 20 feet from the men, and heard Thierbach asking if the dog was going to attack. Midkiff said Thierbach was standing on the bumper of the box truck petting Arzy. &quot;The dog was rubbing up against the cop,&quot; Midkiff said. &quot;He would rub the dog&#039;s back and then push him away. All of a sudden, he just jumped down and shot the dog in the head.&quot; Midkiff said he could see both Thierbach and the dog clearly. &quot;That dog did not bite that officer,&quot; he said. &quot;The dog was wagging his tail, his tongue was hanging out.&quot; Carpenter said he spun around when he heard the gunshot. &quot;I see my dog kind of start shaking and batting at his head,&quot; he said. &quot;I saw the blood start to run down his face. &hellip; I&#039;m watching my dog die while I&#039;m sitting in cuffs.&quot; Thierbach, Carpenter told HuffPost, &quot;seemed to be fighting back a smile.&quot; He said he asked the cop why he was smiling, and that Thierbach &quot;smirked&quot; and replied, &quot;Well, he nipped at my foot.&quot; Backup officers put Arzy&#039;s body in a trash bag and threw it into the back of a vehicle, Carpenter said. According to the Southwest Daily News, police charged Carpenter and Laliberte with trespassing and kept them in jail for a few hours.\r\nMidkiff said he watched as other officers questioned Thierbach about the shooting. Within about 15 minutes, he said, Thierbach&#039;s story changed. He first claimed to have been bitten on the calf, then on the back of his heel. Later, another officer took a photograph of his toe. A Sulphur Police Department public information officer told the Southwest Daily News that the department has launched an internal investigation. The department did not return a request for comment from The Huffington Post.','http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/08/brian-thierbach-quits-cop-shot-dog-arzy-brandon-carpenter_n_5289294.html','Arzy Kensington','Brian Thierbach','1','0',0,0,0,'1','1','Uniform','3','3','1','1','2','1'),(144,'2014-04-18','Texas','Middleton','Rains County Sheriffs Department',1,30,0,'Blue Healer','Owners name Cole Middleton and wife Jayna, a third generation dairy East Texas farmer.

Owners Ryan and Toni Walker. \r\nThe sheriff&rsquo;s office received a call of dogs, belonging to Ryan and Toni Walker, running loose and on a neighbor&rsquo;s property in the area of the 22000 block of FM 1541. In May one of the Walkers&rsquo; other dogs had bitten a 16-year-old boy who lived in the complaining party&rsquo;s residence. Upon leaving the Walker&rsquo;s home, the investigating deputy, John Vaught, shot and killed a charging dog, an Australian Shepherd named Blue, at the Walker&rsquo;s residence in the front yard. &ldquo;This was an unfortunate incident, and I want to publicly express my sympathy and condolences to the dog&rsquo;s owners, Ryan and Toni Walker, as I know they considered Blue to be a member of their family,&rdquo; Richardson said. &ldquo;After reviewing the discharge of a firearm report, I have decided to change our policy regarding canine encounters. The new policy will be in effect after review by legal counsel. It will outline some specific actions and strategies that should help officers avoid using deadly force against canines.&rdquo;\r\nBecause deputies frequently come into contact with dogs each day, from making traffic stops, serving warrants and conducting interviews, Jim Osorio of Canine Encounters Law Enforcement Training of Arlington will conduct a training Oct. 13-14 at the Randall County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office. Osorio&rsquo;s program includes factors contributing to a dog bite, types of aggressive dogs, dog body language, encountering dogs on the job, report writing, use of force continuum, tools of the trade and self-defense against dogs. &ldquo;This training will give officers option and strategies in dealing with aggressive and dangerous dogs and the tools on how to best deescalate these situations,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It will also provide our officers with knowledge and tactics so they can better protect themselves, the citizens we serve and the dogs that officers encounter.&rdquo; Richardson said that the Facebook page &ldquo;Justice for Blue&rdquo; contains false statements regarding the incident. Because of those statements, Richardson showed the dash camera video from the incident to press during the conference. &ldquo;Specific statements indicating that the dog was &lsquo;shot just for barking&rsquo; and that a &lsquo;child was endangered&rsquo; by the shots that were fired, are both inaccurate,&rdquo; Richardson said. When Vaught arrived at the complainant&rsquo;s house, the dogs were no longer there, according to a copy of the incident report provided by the Randall County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office. The deputy then went to the Walkers&rsquo; home, and when he attempted to exit the vehicle two dogs appeared with one charging aggressively, according to the report. Vaught reported that he used pepper spray to protect himself, but it &ldquo;had little effect on the dog.&rdquo; He wrote that once he made contact with Toni Walker, the two dogs &ldquo;became very friendly.&rdquo; The law states that dogs can run unconfined and without leashes if the owners provide a plot of land of at least 5 acres. The Walkers&rsquo; property meets that requirement, but a violation still occurs if the dogs leave the property, Richardson said. The video shows the officer coming out the home, veer out the frame to avoid going near the dog, which was under a parked vehicle. The dog runs toward the officer, which is when shots were fired. However, the officer using his firearm cannot be seen in the video. Richardson said the officer fired five times and shot the dog twice. Toni Walker then comes out of the home holding a small child. Richardson said the dog was still alive, but Walker asked the officer to shoot Blue once more to humanely kill the animal.\r\n&ldquo;The next inaccuracy on the Facebook page is that I provided an &lsquo;edited&rsquo; version of the dash camera footage to the Walkers. Be design the dash camera footage cannot be edited, or it would be of no evidentiary value,&rdquo; Richardson said.\r\nIn the video Toni Walker can be heard apologizing for being extremely upset, to which the officer replies that he understands. Before leaving the scene, Vaught can be heard asking Walker if she would like him to move the dog. She responded that she wanted to move him, and then asked Vaught to hold her 7-month-old son. Walker can then be seen picking up the dog and carrying it behind the home while Vaught follows her with the baby. Vaught then provided Walker with a card for the sheriff&rsquo;s office should she need anything or have other concerns. &ldquo;The question isn&rsquo;t whether or not this was a justified use of force; the question is &lsquo;was it avoidable.&rsquo; My answer to that question is yes,&rdquo; Richardson said. Richardson said he was saddened by the incident, especially witnessing on the video a very upset Toni Walker carry Blue behind the house. He also said that he offered to buy the Walkers&rsquo; a new dog, but was told their other dog was pregnant with puppies fathered by Blue. Richardson said he went to the Walkers&rsquo; home and gave Toni Walker a $500 check to cover veterinary expenses. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been pretty blasted over that, but I did it out of the goodness of my heart,&rdquo; Richardson said. The Walkers have stated they have no intention on cashing the check, but are looking into acquiring legal counsel.','http://www.myplainview.com/canyon/c_top_stories/article_14e54b22-2245-11e4-84ae-001a4bcf887a.html','Blue','John Vaught','0','0',1,0,0,'0','2','Uniform','1','2','0','0','2','0'),(146,'2014-07-27','Missouri','Columbia','Howard County Sheriff Department',1,50,1,'Pit Bull','Victim King pitbull mix, shot with a 12 gauge shotgun.

A Howard County police officer shot and fatally wounded a pit bull in late February, upsetting the dog&#039;s owner, who said the shooting was not necessary.\r\nHoward County police, however, say the dog not only approached an officer aggressively, but charged toward him as well. &quot;I&#039;m a nervous wreck,&quot; said the dog&#039;s owner, Patty Wynston, a 71-year-old who lives in the 9200 block of Whiskey Bottom Road. &quot;She was my dog. She slept with me every night.&quot; Police were called Feb. 26 to Whiskey Bottom Road for reports of two pit bulls running loose. When they got to the owner&#039;s home, the dogs were inside, according to police spokeswoman Sherry Llewellyn. Wynston said the pit bulls, an 8-year-old named Yayo and Yayo&#039;s daughter, 3-year-old Pebbles, had accidentally gotten out earlier. She said police asked Wynston to leash the dogs and bring them out, but she didn&#039;t have enough time to do so before officers again knocked on her door &quot;The doors went open,&quot; Wynston said, &quot;and of course the dogs went out.&quot; Police said that an officer was approaching the home when one of the dogs charged out of the house toward the officer, barking aggressively. &quot;The officer backed away from the dog, which continued to charge and gain speed,&quot; Llewellyn said. &quot;When the dog was approximately three feet from the officer, he drew his weapon and fired at the dog, wounding it.&quot; That pit bull was Yayo, who later had to be euthanized. Wynston said Yayo &quot;was walking toward the officer, but she was not aggressive or nothing until he pulled his gun.&quot; The dog, she said, &quot;wasn&#039;t an aggressive dog, but when people came in our yard, even if she knew them, she&#039;d bark.&quot; Police said their records show neither dog as being licensed or vaccinated, and that Yayo&#039;s license had been revoked in Howard County in 2008. The dog was sent to New York to live with a family member, and there was no record of her having been re-licensed in the county, Llewellyn said. Police policy allows officers to fire their weapons at an animal if doing so will prevent the officer or another person from substantial harm, or if an animal is so badly injured that shooting it will keep it from suffering any further, Llewellyn said. Wynston&#039;s other dog was allowed to stay at the home, as officers did not see them running loose, Llewellyn said. A citation was issued for failure to license and vaccinate the dog. Wynston says Yayo has been cremated and her ashes are now on the mantle. &quot;I was very attached to her,&quot; she said.','http://www.baltimoresun.com/explore/howard/news/crime/ph-ho-cf-dog-shooting-0315-20120313,0,5655392.story','Yayo','Unknown','2','0',0,0,0,'0','1','Uniform','3','2','0','0','2','0'),(148,'2014-07-23','Texas','Cedar Park','Cedar Park Police Department',1,2,1,'Mixed Breed 10yo','Victim is repeatedly reported as a pitbull or pitbull mix following statements by police.

The dog, named Cream, was shot and killed by Anderson police, who arrived at their home to investigate a stolen cell phone. Police tell FOX Carolina they were forced to shoot the dog to protect themselves. Adrien Best, who had two adults, three teens and three young children at her home Monday evening on East Franklin Street, said she heard the shots. She was inside the house when one of her sons told her police were pulling up the driveway. She said by the time she reached the front door, she heard two shots fired. She said she was immediately worried about her children playing outside. Then she realized one of her family&#039;s dogs had been shot by officers. &quot;I tried to gather the kids up to put them in the house because apparently you&#039;re not safe outside with officers where we should be because they&#039;re protecting and serve,&quot; Best said. &quot;If you show up with a gun and you&#039;re irate, then you&#039;re not protecting me so I did not feel safe.&quot; Within moments, she found out why police were at her house. They were investigating a cell phone stolen from T.L. Hanna High School. The report was initiated by the school&#039;s resource officer, who is an Anderson County deputy.\r\nThe phone had been tracked by GPS to Best&#039;s house and was being carried by a friend of her son&#039;s, who told her he had found it at school. The school resource officer called for back-up from Anderson police because the East Franklin Street is in the city. A spokesman for the Anderson County Sheriff&#039;s Office said the resource officer was not on scene yet when the dog was shot. FOX Carolina called the Anderson Police Department, who provided an incident report of the dog shooting. It was written by Officer Joseph Chapman. Part of the report said, &quot;A brown and white large dog charged myself and Captain Aman. Officers did draw duty issue weapons and felt in fear that the dog was going to attack, due to the threatening manner it was coming at officers. Captain Aman did shoot the dog with one shot, at which time the dog went into some bushes and was not a threat.&quot; But the family gave a different story, calling their dog a gentle giant. Adrian Gaines, one of Best&#039;s sons, was in the driveway when he saw officers arrive and witnessed the shooting. &quot;The dog didn&#039;t bark, show any teeth, it didn&#039;t rush them, didn&#039;t growl or anything,&quot; Gaines said. &quot;Once he shot him the first time, I&#039;m sure he was scared and that&#039;s how he got up in the bushes and he ran up in the bushes and that&#039;s when you shoot him again. He&#039;s in the bushes bleeding already and you shoot him again.&quot; The shooting of the dog was witnessed by four children, including a 13-year-old named Jeremiah. He cried for hours after the dog was killed. He and others in the family want to know why this happened.\r\n&quot;He was a good dog,&quot; Jeremiah said. &quot;He didn&#039;t deserve to die. They shouldn&#039;t have shot him. There was no point to it.&quot; Now, the family plans to file a formal complaint with Anderson police. In the meantime, the department indicates they did what they had to do to make sure their officers were safe. They said because the dog was not in a fence or tethered, there was no option. For Jeremiah, that&#039;s not good enough, saying, &quot;Something needs to happen.

Your dog attacked me, and I killed it.&#039;&quot; His father, Michael Reeves, who wore a denim jacket with a patch that read &quot;Vern&quot; on the chest, stood in the driveway. He choked up as he described where the bullet casings were found. The family has two other dogs, a Chesapeake Retriever named Jazmin and a French Bulldog named Madeline. &quot;I just don&#039;t get it,&quot; he said, walking inside and shaking his head. The family said the officer wanted to interview a neighbor and was walking across the front yards of homes on the street when the shooting happened. The Reeves family was not involved in the burglary investigation that brought the officer to their neighborhood. Vern barked and ran toward the officer, prompting the shooting, the family said. The police department promised a full investigation and acknowledged that the shooting was a traumatic incident for the family of the deceased dog.','http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/anne-arundel/pasadena/bs-md-officer-kills-dog-20140202,0,3864041.story','Vern','Rodney Price','2','0',0,0,0,'0','2','Uniform','0','2','1','0','2','0'),(159,'2008-02-08','Nevada','Las Vegas','North Las Vegas Police Department',2,100,1,'Pit Bull and Mastiff','Owner Louisa Thurston.

When 8-year-old Zaley, daughter of Mike and Christy Packett, went to bed at night, Raccoon Baby was always beside her. Zaley was taken out of school Friday morning where she is a second grader at Forrest Hunt Elementary School so her parents could tell her the fate of her playmate of six years, Raccoon. Thursday afternoon Raccoon was found dead of a gunshot wound between her eyes in the woods about 150 yards from Mike, Christy and Zaley Packett&#039;s home off Valley View Drive in Forest City. Forest City Police Officer Sean Brooks, who also lives on Valley View Drive, was placed on paid suspension from his duties regarding shooting the neighbor&#039;s dog while off-duty. \r\nBrooks has been an officer with the Forest City Police Department since January 2013. Today he awaits news from a mid-week meeting with Forest City Police Chief Jay Jackson, District Attorney Brad Greenway and detectives regarding the shooting and any charges. According to Jackson, Brooks admitted shooting the six-year-old boxer and said it was &quot;in self-defense of his family and wife.&quot; However, there was no police incident report of any dog being aggressive and no police report was filed of shooting an animal inside city limits, which is unlawful. Another staff member at the Forest City Police Department learned from Mike the dog was missing. Mike had filed a report and also offered a reward for Raccoon&#039;s return. On Thursday afternoon the staff member put the case together and Mike was called to meet police officers in a wooded area near his house. Mike said he met them about 150 yards from his house. Raccoon was in a bag. \r\n&quot;I asked them if that was my dog. They told me he had been shot between the eyes,&quot; Mike said. &quot;Why would somebody shoot this kind gentle soul? There is no reason for this.&quot; &quot;He was an off duty officer, used his own personal weapon and said the dog was aggressive with him . . . he never came to us to tell us he had to shoot my dog,&quot; Mike said. Raccoon went missing at about 3 p.m. Wednesday after she and the family&#039;s other bulldog, Dufus, had been playing outdoors. Raccoon didn&#039;t return when she was called, Mike explained. He said that was very unusual so the search for her began. The dogs had just received a bath and Mike did not put their electronic collars on them because they were still wet. For the next 24 hours the dog was missing. Mike said he and others combed their neighborhood covering about 200 acres searching and calling for Raccoon. &quot;The worst part is we went right past them and never once did they tell us,&quot; Mike said of Brooks&#039; family. &quot;We spent a lot of time looking for our dog,&quot; Christy Packett said. Brooks was eventually fired and pled guilty to misdemeanor cruelty to animals and misdemeanor resisting a police officer. District Court Judge Laura Powell sentenced Brooks to 30 days in jail, suspended sentence, unsupervised probation for 12 months, 24 hours of community service within the next 30 days, cost of court and community service fees. Brooks was also ordered by Powell not to have contact with Mike Packett or any member of his family. Owner Mike Packet was charged with violating a town ordinance in Forest City by allowing his dog to run loose. The charge was dismissed, as the dog had run away and was not &quot;allowed&quot; to run loose.

The police chief says the shooting was justified, but the family says the action was excessive and unnecessary. Four-year-old Kenya was a German Shepherd Lab mix. She&#039;s been known to roam her Irmo neighborhood from time to time. But her family says she&#039;s never gone far and never hurt anyone. &quot;She&#039;s probably gotten out about three or four times and usually a neighbor comes by [and says] &#039;Hey, your dog&#039;s in my yard,&#039; and we go get her,&quot; said Kenya&#039;s owner Jared Mann. &quot;It&#039;s never been a big deal.&quot; When her family returned to their Charring Cross Road home after Labor Day fun, Kenya was not there. &quot;We found a note on the front door saying that our dog has been shot by Irmo PD,&quot; said Mann. &quot;We found the blood right after we found the note in our front yard.&quot; Several neighbors say they heard gun shots. &quot;My husband and me were both talking to the police officers that were here,&quot; said the neighbor. &quot;And the one who shot the dog said that she had charged him. But we had seen that dog before in our backyard and she&#039;s never shown any aggression ever.&quot; Irmo Police say they received a call from a jogger who says Kenya chased this person down the street. When officers arrived, the dog was back on its property -- in the front yard, near the steps. Mann says they&#039;ve tried many different methods to restrain Kenya, including building a fence just for the dog and putting in an electrical fence as well. There&#039;s also a chair attached to the back steps, but somehow Kenya escaped. Police say when one of the officers tried to go to the front door to find the owners, the dog charged at him. The officer says he felt threatened by the dog&#039;s aggressive behavior so he fired two shots at the dog. &quot;He charged me,&quot; said the officer in the incident report. &quot;I had to shoot him.&quot; &quot;She was still moving 30 minutes later and I asked if I could take her to the vet and they said no,&quot; said a neighbor. &quot;And that&#039;s when one of the police officers asked the other police officer to get a tarp and just covered her up.&quot; Irmo Police deny that. The report goes on to say the officer fired a third and final shot to &quot;end the dog&#039;s misery.&quot; Family and neighbors do not understand why a gun had to be fired and why the officer killed Kenya. &quot;With the dog being that close to the house, if it was in the middle of the street, it&#039;d be a little bit different I think. But the dog was on its own property so I felt he could have left the dog alone,&quot; said a neighbor. In a statement provided by the jogger, he praises the officer&#039;s candor in regard to the incident. &quot;[He] seemed equally concerned about the dog as he was about the safety of the neighborhood. It was clear that he did not want anyone or the dog to get hurt. He seemed like a true professional in control of the situation,&quot; said the statement. Irmo Police Chief Brian Buck says the officer acted in self-defense. According to an Irmo ordinance, it is illegal for any domestic animal to run at large on the streets or in public places. When asked if the officer could have tasered the dog instead of shooting it, Buck said the officer used the weapon he thought would guarantee his safety.','http://www.wistv.com/story/23324440/irmo-family-unhappy-officer-shot-and-killed-their-dog','Kenya','Unknown','1','0',0,0,0,'0','2','Uniform','3','3','0','0','2','0'),(166,'2013-05-21','Nevada','Las Vegas','Las Vegas Police Department',1,30,0,'Australian Shepherd','Shouting, &ldquo;Justice for Freckles,&rdquo; about a dozen people at the Regional Justice Center on Thursday protested canine killings by Las Vegas police officers. Led by Las Vegan Sarah Hecht, whose 45-pound Australian shepherd hybrid was run down by a two-ton police cruiser earlier this year, the protestors asked for better training for police officers dealing with animals. A police spokeswoman declined to comment on the case because there was an ongoing internal affairs investigation into the incident. The investigation is expected to take several more months. Hecht, 22, was overcome with emotion while speaking of her beloved pet who was a birthday present for getting straight As in high school. An officer told Hecht he purposefully ran over the dog after it had escaped her backyard and was heading toward children playing on May 21. Freckles was dragged by the police cruiser, but lived. Hecht rushed the canine to a veterinarian. The dog licked his owner during the trip. Once there, Hecht made the difficult decision to euthanize the animal. Hecht believes Freckles escaped her backyard after he was taunted by neighborhood children. She insisted her dog would never hurt anyone and had no history of biting humans. While she was at the veterinarian&rsquo;s office, Hecht&rsquo;s father was cited with having an unrestrained dog. Following the protest Thursday, Hecht wept before Las Vegas Justice of the Peace Karen Bennett-Haron as she explained what police had done to her dog and how she had no money left after paying $1,000 to try and save her &ldquo;son&rsquo;s&rdquo; life. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have children. He was my son,&rdquo; Hecht told the judge.\r\nBennett-Haron and prosecutors quickly agreed to dismiss the charges.

They discussed what to do, and when the officer offered to put the cat out of its misery, using a night stick was the last thing Wayne expected. &quot;I went inside expecting a gun shot and then I heard it happening on my front porch. I heard at least 15-20 hits,&quot; Wayne says. The officer removed the body, but he had to clean the rest.\r\n&quot;It was nasty to say the least. I was sick to my stomach the whole time doing it. I tried to wash it off as best as I could,&quot; Wayne says. The officer told him to contact police because of damage to the house. There are stains and smashed siding around the porch. Wayne did contact police, but says they didn&#039;t get back to him. However, the department offered WHSV this statement saying they did receive the complaint.\r\n&quot;An internal investigation was conducted into this matter and appropriate action has been taken internally. In addition, the department continues to review the current procedures in handling animal complaints is to determine if any changes or modifications need to be made.&quot; Wayne says he was so shocked to act at the time, but hopes this never happens again. &quot;The only thing I wished I had done differently is as soon as I saw that nightstick I would&#039;ve ran out and stopped him.

Media outlets report that a judge found 25-year-old Jonathan Snoddy guilty of the misdemeanor charge Thursday in Rockingham County General District Court. Retired Judge Steven Helvin of Charlottesville ordered Snoddy to pay a $50 fine. Snoddy was charged in January following a Virginia State Police investigation. Resident Wayne Meadows told investigators that he took the cat home on Nov. 11, 2011, after a car hit the animal and called Harrisonburg authorities. Police department policy calls for an officer to euthanize an animal by shooting it, after getting supervisor&#039;s permission. Instead, Meadows said Snoddy hit the cat up to 20 times with his baton.

Cimarron St. to investigate a possible disturbance. Upon arrival, officers were walking up to the residence&rsquo;s rear facing door. While doing so a large pit bull aggressively and quickly ran from the house and towards the officers. Noting the dog&rsquo;s aggressive behavior and stance, one of the officers fired several rounds at the animal as it continued approaching them. One of these rounds struck the dog in the rear leg, causing the dog to briefly end its advance and flee towards the house. Officers were then able to retreat and while doing so the dog again began aggressively and quickly approaching the officers. Prior to being forced to discharge their weapon again, the officers were able to close and hold the gate shut until the dog&rsquo;s owner, Patrick Lawrence (a 49 year-old resident of Colorado Springs), was able to contain the animal in a dog crate. During the subsequent investigation, officers were unable to develop probable cause to arrest anyone for the original disturbance call for service but Mr. Lawrence was arrested for possessing a dangerous animal.&rdquo; Lawrence says the only fact he agrees with in the report was that his dog was wounded. &ldquo;If the dog was aggressively trying to get at him, why&rsquo;s the dog shot in the butt?&rdquo; Lawrence asked. Lawrence believes this was a case of a dog protecting its territory.\r\n&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how he do man because he protective, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; Lawrence said.

A puddle of blood is visible not far from Jeri Fahrenkrugs back yard. It is the spot where she said police shot and killed her pit bull from 30 feet away. I feel like I lost a child pretty much. I have been crying all day, Fahrenkrug said. I felt like the police officer shot my dog because he wanted to, because my dog was a pit bull. I don’t think that it was right. Fahrenkrug said killing her dog was unnecessary and cruel because it wasnt hurting anyone. Newton police said the dog got loose from its leash and tried to bite a man passing by. When an officer arrived, police said the dog lunged at him, too. At that point, obviously, he felt there was a threat to him or to other peoples safety, so he made a decision to shoot the dog, said Lt. Wayne Winchell, of the Newton Police Department. Neighbors, who said they saw the shooting from their front porches, disagreed. That dog did not charge at that officer at all. It was like being shot in the back, said witness Cindi Crady. Fahrenkrug said her dog, Griz, who was named by her 4 year old daughter, was gentle and more like a member of the family than a pet. He is not vicious. He cuddles at me. He cuddles with my daughter. He is very friendly toward everyone, Fahrenkrug said. I dont think that he is replaceable. It was very unnecessary. I own three dogs. I am a dog lover, and what happened to that dog should not have happened at all, Crady said. The investigation is ongoing, police said. Officers said they believe the dog bit someone a few weeks before the shooting.','http://www.kcci.com/news/central-iowa/Officer-shoots-kills-family-s-dog/-/9357080/16620586/-/9ou939/-/index.html#ixzz26bjvBzry','Griz','Ron Cook','2','0',2,0,0,'0','2','Uniform','3','2','0','0','2','0'),(180,'2012-08-13','New York','New York','NYPD',1,50,1,'Pit Bull','NYPD shoots homeless man\'s dog because he barked.

Shannon Underwood, the teenage daughter of the dogs owner Kathy Sheffield, was breaking the dogs up with sticks. Crank claims that all three dogs were pit bulls. Sheffield reported that the dogs were English Bulldogs. Crank proceeded to use mace on the dogs. Unsatisfied with the results from the Mace, he shot each dog in the head. One of the three dogs was owned by Charvelle Hudson. It is unclear what Hudsons relationship to Sheffield is. Both Sheffield and Hudson arrived on the scene, where Crank advised them that they had violated city ordinances by keeping vicious dogs. The child, Shannon Underwood, had been bit on the hand and leg by the dogs. She was taken to the Medical Center of Southeastern Oklahoma Emergency.

Around 9 p.m., a DeKalb officer went to her home on Silva Court in response to a domestic dispute call with a possibly armed person. The officer said the family&rsquo;s German shepherd lunged at him, so he killed the dog. The recently rescued animal was chained in the garage when the shooting happened. Currie&rsquo;s husband, Anthony, said the officer also pointed his gun at him and told him to put his hands up. &ldquo;I said, &lsquo;Why [did] you shoot my dog?&rsquo; And he said, &lsquo;Well, I&#039;ll blow your brains out.&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;Hold on a minute, you just killed my dog. Why you want to blow my brains out? My hands are up.&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I don&#039;t have no gun,&rsquo;&rdquo; Anthony Currie said. Later, Dekalb police sent another officer to the scene. The supervisor who showed up said an error was made by an officer who was trying to help someone else. &ldquo;Subsequent investigation determined that the actual address that he was looking for was actually across the street,&rdquo; DeKalb police Lt. Dane Cunningham said. The first officer faces no disciplinary action, but he will have to go before the shooting review board and face an internal investigation. The Curries said they don&rsquo;t like what happened but can understand it. &ldquo;Now that I know what he was dealing with and there&#039;s human error, I can understand why it happened,&rdquo; Bobbie Currie said.

City officials fail to enforce existing state and local laws regarding animals. The case involves a Bloomfield police officer, who admitted that on January 21, he trapped Larry, a two-year-old neutered cat who belonged to a local resident, shot him immediately and dumped his body behind a city maintenance shed.&ldquo;The Officer openly admitted this series of events took place, and was given a mere written warning.

According to local residents, this law is routinely violated, Robinson said.\r\n\r\nAdditional local and state laws broken by the Officer&rsquo;s action:\r\n\r\nBloomfield ordinance &sect; 6-106&mdash;states that owners of cats and dogs found outside &ldquo;shall be notified in writing by the Police Department of their violation,&rdquo; meaning Larry should have been impounded and the owners notified that he was at large. Bloomfield ordinance &sect; 6-107&mdash;authorizes the killing by officers of dogs and cats whose &ldquo;capture is impossible.&rdquo; Because the Officer was able to trap Larry, clearly capture was not &ldquo;impossible,&rdquo; and the killing was not authorized. Nebraska State Law R.R.S. Neb. &sect; 28-1009, which states that &ldquo;a person who cruelly mistreats an animal is guilty of a Class I misdemeanor for the first offense and a Class IV felony for any subsequent offense;&rdquo; and defines cruel mistreatment as &ldquo;knowingly and intentionally kill[ing], maim[ing[, disfigure[ing],&rdquo; and otherwise harming an animal.','http://www.lifewithcats.tv/2014/03/07/call-for-action-after-police-officer-traps-and-kills-pet-cat/','Larry','Wally Holz','1','0',0,0,0,'0','0','Not Sure','3','3','0','0','2','0'),(687,'2008-03-22','Pennsylvania','Cecil Township','Cecil Township Police Department',1,1,0,'Cat 10yo','as shot and killed by a police officer.It happened on Saturday after the cat wandered away from its Cecil Township home.

Lebanon City Manager Pat Clements issued a statement clearing the police department of any wrongdoing. Based on the information I have received, it appears that the officers actions were necessary and in compliance with departmental policies, Clement said. There are currently no local or county agencies equipped to respond to sick or injured stray cats, and our options are limited. Lebanon Police Department policy is to destroy sick or injured stray cats where they are found and under no circumstances is an officer to transport the animal in a city vehicle. The policy, however, appears to violate Ohio Revised Code. Cats are one of a number of animals protected by the code that says no one shall ?maliciously, or willfully and without consent of the owner? injure animals. The violation is a first-degree misdemeanor. Clements did not comment on the apparent violation, the Western Star reported.','http://www.officer.com/news/10342180/family-wants-policy-changed-after-ohio-police-kill-cat','Haze','Unknown','1','0',0,0,0,'0','2','Uniform','3','3','0','0','2','0'),(689,'2012-06-23','South Dakota','Rapid City','Rapid City Police Department and Game Fish &amp; Parks',1,100,0,'Mountain Lion','A Rapid City family received an unwelcome guest on Saturday morning -- a mountain lion.\r\n\r\nRapid City police were called to the residence on Reservoir Road to find the lion hiding in a machine shed.

A Village of Stryker resident&rsquo;s complaint brought about an investigation and court case, and led to the issue becoming news. Ada Pierson, who has three cats of her own, took it upon herself to feed several strays she felt were in need help.  Ada told Channel 13 news, &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not being fed and they&rsquo;re not being taken care of,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I felt sorry for them.&rdquo; The cats disappeared in January  after a neighbor complained about cat feces and urine on their property, and Ms. Pierson claimed the local police trapped and killed them, then disposed of their bodies. &ldquo;They were either shot or they were drowned,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s horrible, they did not deserve what got. Why Stryker Police thought it was their duty to do something, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; A cat belonging to neighbor Carol Seehand was inadvertently caught up in the sweep and was shot and killed along with the feral cats.  Ms. Seehand filed a complaint against the police chief. Ms. Pierson contacted the Williams County Humane Society with allegations of animal cruelty, and a Humane Officer lodged a complaint. The Fulton County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department opened an investigation of police practices and the matter was turned over to the prosecutor&rsquo;s office in Bryan for review. Charges were brought against Stryker Police Chief Steve Schlosser. Prosecutors said Schlosser ordered officers to trap stray cats and shoot them.  Officers then dumped the dead animals&rsquo; bodies in the river. In a court appearance last month, Chief Schlosser pleaded no contest to animal cruelty saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m taking responsibility for my actions and my officers&rsquo; actions because that&rsquo;s what leaders do.&rdquo; The judge sentenced Schlosser to pay a $500 fine.   When asked for a comment on the sentence outside the courtroom, Ada Pierson &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he should keep his job.&rdquo; On the night of Monday June 10 the Stryker Village Council voted to suspend Schlosser for two weeks without pay. Public reaction continues to be mixed, with those who were outraged at the killings and dumpings feeling that justice was not served and punishment should have been greater, and those who felt the killing of &ldquo;just cats&rdquo; was no big deal saying greater punishment was not warranted.

On July 12, a mountain lion was spotted in an area west of where the cat was shot Thursday.  A resident of a Norwoodville neighborhood, which is just southeast of the eastern mixmaster reported a mountain lion in the 3200 block of NE 46th Street on July 12. Children at the Norwoodville Rec Center were told to go inside as a precaution. Two police cars were sent to check out the report, but never found the cat during the July incident.

A monkey believed to be infected with Herpes-B was the last holdout, but police say it could have been eaten by one of the other escaped animals. &quot;We&#039;re convinced that we do not have any animals running at large,&quot; the Sheriff&#039;s office told NBC4. Sheriffs in Zanesville, Ohio, a  mostly rural area about 55 miles east of Columbus, have been working with zoo officials and wildlife expert Jack Hanna and agreed on a shoot-to-kill order, considering the immediate danger presented to the community. &quot;If you had 18 Bengal tigers running around this area, you folks wouldn&#039;t want to see what would happen,&quot; Hanna said at a press conference. The deceased animals include a wolf, six black bears, two grizzly bears, nine male lions, eight lionesses, a baboon, three mountain lions and 18 tigers, authorities said. They were buried at the location they were killed. Authorities were able to transport six animals to the Columbus Zoo, a grizzly bear, three leopards and two monkeys. The animals escaped from the Muskingum County Animal Farm in Zanesville after the owner threw their cages open and committed suicide, authorities said. Mike Dodd with the Muskingum County Sheriff&#039;s Office told FoxNews.com that authorities are urging the public to &quot;keep your eyes open.&quot; Schools were also closed, parents were warned to keep children and pets indoors and flashing signs along highways told motorists, &quot;Caution exotic animals&quot; and &quot;Stay in vehicle.&quot; Neighbor Danielle White, whose father&#039;s property abuts the Muskingum County Animal Farm, said she didn&#039;t see loose animals this time but did in 2006, when a lion escaped. &quot;It&#039;s always been a fear of mine knowing (the owner) had all those animals,&quot; she said. &quot;I have kids. I&#039;ve heard a male lion roar all night.&quot; The owner of the preserve, Terry Thompson, left the cages open and the fences unsecured, releasing dozens of animals, including lions, tigers, bears and wolves, before committing suicide, said Muskingum County Sheriff Matt Lutz. His body was discovered in the driveway. Authorities would not say how he killed himself and no suicide note was found. Lutz wouldn&#039;t speculate on why he committed suicide. But Thompson had had repeated run-ins with the law, and Lutz said the sheriff&#039;s office had received numerous complaints since 2004 about animals at the property. Authorities had difficulty entering the property because wild animals could be seen at its entrance, authorities said. The first responding officers used their handguns to help contain the animals.','http://www.foxnews.com/us/2011/10/19/exotic-animals-on-loose-in-ohio-after-park-owner-found-dead/','A wolf, six black bears, two grizzly bears, nine male lions, eight lionesses, a baboon, three mountain lions and 18 tigers','Multiple officers','1','0',0,0,0,'0','0','Uniform','3','3','0','0','0','0'),(710,'2014-08-31','Iowa','Ottumwa','Ottumwa Police Department',1,50,1,'Pit Bull','The following is based entirely on police statements: A domestic disturbance call ends when a police officer shoots the family dog. At approximately 3:12 p.m. Sunday, officers were dispatched to 905 N. Court, in reference to a domestic disturbance. When the officer arrived, he observed a pit bull that did not have on a collar. The officer asked the female, at the residence, if the dog belonged to her and she said it did. According to Ottumwa Police Chief Tom McAndrew, the situation escalated quickly almost immediately after the officer asked who owned the dog. &ldquo;The dog began to charge the officer and attempted to bite him. The officer drew his service weapon and discharged one round at the dog, striking it once in its front right leg near the elbow,&rdquo; said Chief McAndrew. The gunshot did not kill the dog and it was transported to a local veterinarian clinic.  &ldquo;The police officer transported the dog and the dog&rsquo;s owner to the vet, because the owner did not have a vehicle,&rdquo; said McAndrew. Sunday&rsquo;s incident was, reportedly, not the first time the Ottumwa Police encountered this pit bull. \r\n&ldquo;The dog had been ordered out of Ottumwa a few weeks ago, due to the city&rsquo;s ordinance against keeping pit bulls inside the city limits. The owner had advised that the dog had been removed from the city limits,&rdquo; said McAndrew. &ldquo;Our Community Service Officer Jeff Williams is actually in Arizona for training right now. When he returns, we will be able to determine the date that the pit bull was ordered out of the city and then we will determine if there will be any charges filed against the owner.&rdquo; The dog will remain at the veterinary clinic until Officer Williams returns from training. &ldquo;Once the dog was treated, the police department decided that the dog would be impounded at the veterinarian&rsquo;s office until we decide what we will do with the dog,&rdquo; said McAndrew. \r\nThe officer, who shot the dog, is not on administrative leave. However, the police department will take steps to determine that the officer took the correct action, in shooting the pit bull. &ldquo;We will look at the incident and determine whether he acted appropriately and go from there,&rdquo; said McAndrew. &ldquo;Looking at the reports, it looks like the officer did an outstanding job and did what he was supposed to. It looks to me that he was justified in shooting the dog and we are lucky that it didn&rsquo;t kill the dog, fortunately for the dog.&rdquo; Although the dog lived through the incident, it is unclear what his fate will be. &ldquo;What we have to decide now is whether we are going to let the owner have the dog or if we are going to put the dog down. We had reports from some of the neighbors, after the shooting, who stated that they had been chased by and attacked by the dog as well. It appears that the dog is vicious,&rdquo; said McAndrew. &ldquo;We gave the owner a chance to get the dog out of the city limits and she did not do that, so we will be conferring with our city attorney and decide what we are going to do with the dog.&rdquo; ','http://www.ottumwaeveningpost.com/9470/87459/a/ottumwa-police-officer-shoots-pit-bull','Unknown Pit Bull','Unknown','1','1',0,0,0,'2','2','Uniform','1','2','0','0','2','0'),(711,'2012-03-09','California','Redding','Redding Police Department',2,10,1,'Chihuahua pregnant 2yo and Boxer Puppy 8 months old','Police killed a pregnant 2-year-old chihuahua and an 8 month old boxer.

The rat terrier and shih tzu mix isn&#039;t using her custom-made ramp to get to her fenced side yard, either.\r\nHer death, reportedly from a bullet fired by a Chaffee police officer Feb. 19, has prompted the Missouri Department of Agriculture to order a shutdown of Chaffee&#039;s animal impound and a separate investigation by the Scott County Sheriff&#039;s Department involving Chaffee police, the town&#039;s mayor and city workers. Police chief Jim Chambers was fired by the city council in a closed meeting, but members won&#039;t say why. According to a copy of the incident report about the dog&#039;s shooting obtained by the Southeast Missourian, it was the mayor who suggested that city employees shoot the dog and dispose of its body. A dispatch log shows that a dispatcher was later ordered to not tell the dog&#039;s owners about the fate of their pet. But it appears that no criminal charges will be filed in connection with the dog&#039;s death. According to a news release from Scott County Prosecuting Attorney Paul Boyd&#039;s office issued Thursday, the sheriff&#039;s department submitted probable-cause affidavits to Boyd on Feb. 28 requesting that Chaffee Mayor Steve Loucks be charged with animal abuse and making a false declaration. The sheriff&#039;s department also requested a false declaration charge for Chambers. Boyd turned the request over to Butler County prosecutor Kevin Barbour a short time later to avoid a conflict of interest, since he often works with the Chaffee Police Department. Boyd&#039;s office received a letter Thursday from Butler County that stated that upon review of evidence, a criminal conviction could not be supported and the Elfrink family would be &quot;better suited to seek civil damages.&quot; A copy of the Feb. 19 incident report and a dispatch log of the Chaffee Police Department from the same date was obtained Wednesday by the Southeast Missourian. Robert Ludwig, the officer who shot the dog, writes that on the day the dog was picked up by a city worker, the mayor and the police chief told him to take it out to the city compost site and shoot it, and that Chambers advised him to &quot;keep it quiet and not tell anyone.&quot; The report says the police department received a call around 1 p.m. from a Chaffee resident who said a dog had been outside the resident&#039;s apartment for most of the day and appeared to have mange. Ludwig responded to 537 W. Yoakum St. and then called the station to have a dispatcher request the city&#039;s animal control officer, Jerry Laxton. Ludwig also thought the dog had mange. The dispatcher could not reach Laxton, so Ludwig drove to Rhodes 101 store in Chaffee, where Laxton works part time. As they talked about the dog, Loucks entered the store and was told about the dog and that the officers weren&#039;t sure what to do with it. It was then, Ludwig wrote, that he suggested taking to the dog to a veterinarian, but Loucks said no and to take the dog out to the city compost site and shoot it. Ludwig and Mark Lueder, a city employee who picked up the dog, met at the compost site around 3 p.m. Ludwig wrote that he went to the site because Lueder left a message at the police station that he did not have a gun. When Ludwig arrived, Lueder had already dug a hole. &quot;I then loaded a range round into my service weapon and then Mark placed the dog into the hole. At that time I took aim and shot the dog once in the head,&quot; Ludwig wrote. According to the report, Lueder covered the hole, and the two men left. Dispatcher logs show Jennifer Elfrink called the police station at 4:30 p.m. and reported her 14-year-old dog, which was blind and deaf with back legs that did not work properly and looked like it had mange, was missing. She told the dispatcher the dog did not have mange but suffered from another virus and was on medication. The log says Ludwig was advised of the call. At 6:15 p.m., logs show, Elfrink called back and said she was worried someone would find the dog and think it was sick or abused. The dispatcher wrote he advised Elfrink that he was not aware of a dog being located. Close to midnight, Elfrink called back a third time and said she was driving around looking for the dog with her children in the car and that she was worried. The dispatcher checked the log, saw a dog was found and disposed of, and called Chambers. At midnight, Chambers is listed on the log as telling the dispatcher not to tell Elfrink anything. Chambers could not be reached at his home number Thursday. Acting police chief Dustin Jarrell was not at the police station Thursday and would not return to work until this morning, according to a communications employee at the department. Loucks was reached by phone Thursday at Chaffee City Hall before the Boyd&#039;s release was sent to media. Loucks said he could not comment because the incident was under investigation and that he was advised not to. He also wouldn&#039;t comment on who was advising him. The Southeast Missourian requested the city&#039;s ordinances relating to dogs during the call and received the documents at city hall Thursday afternoon. State law requires all incorporated cities or towns to collect dogs found running at large without collars and place them in a pound. The city shall keep dogs for five business days and allows euthanasia using humane methods if the animal is not claimed by its owner by the end of that period. Section 270.150 of Chaffee city ordinances state an animal not redeemed within seven days becomes city property and shall be placed for adoption or humanely euthanized. The city&#039;s pound was found to be unlicensed under the Animal Care Facilities Act during a March 6 investigation by the Department of Agriculture. In a March 5 email to Loucks, Animal Care program manager Matt Rold wrote that a complaint filed by a Chaffee resident prompted the investigation. Loucks said Thursday that the city&#039;s pound could not receive animals but that police could still deal with animals if one caused harm or threatened to cause harm, per instruction of the Agriculture Department. The investigation found numerous issues, including that the impound did not meet requirements for cleaning, food storage, waste disposal, shelter, construction of facilities, identification of impounded animals, record keeping, handling of animals or minimum holding period. The inspection report also says the city must go through the application process and meet all requirements by April 6. &quot;We won&#039;t be back open until some changes are made,&quot; Loucks said. Scott County Sheriff Rick Walter said the probable-cause affidavit requesting charges for Loucks and Chambers could not be released unless a prosecutor filed charges. Walter said he was aware that Jennifer Elfrink had contacted the Agriculture Department to file a complaint and that she shared with him an initial recommendation from the department. The department advised her that normally she could contact law enforcement, but that in this case, Walter said Elfrink was told, &quot;the local police are probably not going to help you.&quot; Elfrink&#039;s husband Wayne was contacted Thursday afternoon at their home. He said what happened to their dog was &quot;a sad situation.&quot; Several city council members reached by the Southeast Missourian declined to comment.

But before the officer got to the door, he shot and killed the family pet. At the quiet country home east of Goshen, you can seldom hear anything but the wind blowing through the trees. But that peace and quiet was shattered by the bullet from the gun of an Elkhart County sheriff&#039;s deputy. The aftermath was caught on a cellphone video.

The officer then asks if he should leave and the homeowner tells him yes. &quot;It&#039;s a family member and to just see something like that is something you&#039;re just not going to forget,&quot; said the owner of the dog, Josh Bender, &quot;My dog&#039;s name was Charlie. He was a red heeler lab mix dog. He was a pretty cool little guy. He loved to play fetch. He was always playing fetch, always.&quot; Bender watched as Charlie died from a gunshot.

But before Josh could walk outside, Charlie had been shot. &quot;I was just getting ready to come out the door and I heard a pop,&quot; Bender said, &quot;I looked out the door and saw my dog flailing around here with blood everywhere and a police officer standing there with a look on his face like &#039;what did I do?&#039;&quot; The Benders live about a quarter mile off of CR 36 and the officer, Mike Daly, had to drive the entire way down their driveway to their house. According to the Elkhart County Sheriff&#039;s Department, Daly had first observed the dogs to be friendly, but shortly after they became aggressive. As he tried to back up to his car, he claims one of the dogs charged &ndash; that&#039;s when he shot it.

Just a really sad situation, it could have been totally avoided if he would have just thought about it.&quot; According to the Elkhart County Sheriff&#039;s Department, Daly is a veteran officer. The sheriff&#039;s department says they have a protocol for this type of thing. The department says it is investigating the incident and is taking it very seriously. It has been nearly a week since an Elkhart County sheriff&#039;s deputy shot and killed someone&#039;s dog. After an investigation, the department is sticking by the officer&#039;s actions. On Saturday the officer went to a home in the 16400 block of CR 36 to investigate a traffic incident that had occurred earlier in the day. Police say the officer was attacked by that dog while he was doing his job. The dog&#039;s owner says his dog just wanted to play.

McNeal tried to cross the road near Fourth Street and Second Avenue N. Officers grabbed at him and McNeal released his hold of the leash. Once free, the dog turned and tried to bite one of the officers, police said. An officer fired several shots and killed the dog. McNeal was arrested and charged with trespassing and resisting arrest with violence. As with any shooting, internal affairs is investigating. St. Petersburg police have come under public scrutiny before for dog shootings. In 2011, officers killed at least seven dogs, prompting then-Chief Chuck Harmon to make some policy changes.','http://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/st-pete-officer-shoots-and-kills-german-shepherd-near-williams-park/2160413','Unknown German Shepard','Steven L.

Chris Clark, 44, said he was walking his Rottweiler, Quincy, and his landlord&#039;s Chesapeake Bay retriever, Missy, about 10 p.m. He was in the 4600 block of Sixth Avenue North when he noticed a golden retriever being walked behind him without a leash. He said he decided to speed up to put some distance between his leashed dogs and the retriever. That&#039;s when he noticed Officer Slobodan Juric walking toward him. Juric was in the area responding to a complaint about a suspicious person, according to police reports. Clark said Juric was yelling, trying to find two kids who were allegedly casing cars. &quot;He was real Joe Macho,&quot; Clark said of Juric. Then Clark heard Missy and the unleashed dog growling at each other. By the time he turned to look, Quincy&#039;s leash had wrapped around him. He fell and the dogs started fighting. Clark said he was grabbing his dogs&#039; collars, trying to pull them away, when Juric yelled &quot;mad dog&quot; and pointed the gun at Missy. Clark said the gun was 3 inches from his ear when Juric fired one shot into the dog. Then the officer pointed the gun at Quincy and fired another round, Clark said. Then two more into Missy. Clark said he was in shock and started yelling at the officer, who still had his gun out. &quot;What the hell did you do that for?&quot; Clark said he yelled. &quot;You curse at me one more time and I&#039;m going to arrest you,&quot; Clark remembers Juric saying. The St. Petersburg Police Department declined to comment on the specifics of Clark&#039;s allegations, said spokesman Mike Puetz. &quot;We&#039;ve begun an internal affairs investigation,&quot; he said. &quot;There will be a statement taken from (Clark) and from everybody who was a witness in the case, to try and discern the totality of the events and the appropriateness of the (officer&#039;s) action.&quot; Juric, 25, has been with the department for more than a year. He was a freelance photographer for the St. Petersburg Times&#039; free tabloid tbt* from 2006 through 2008. Clark and his landlord, Joan Caldwell, 78, said the dogs weren&#039;t aggressive. Quincy was a 1-year-old shelter rescue. Missy was 7 and taken from some people Caldwell knew in Coquina Key. Caldwell said she wrote a letter to the police chief about the incident. She was not a witness, she said, but she doesn&#039;t understand why it happened. &quot;If they were running loose, I could understand why they were shot,&quot; she said.\r\n&quot;But they were just dogs doing the natural thing to defend themselves,&quot; Caldwell said.','http://www.theledger.com/article/20100913/NEWS/9135076','Quincy and Missy','Slobodan Juric','2','0',1,0,0,'0','2','Uniform','3','3','2','2','2','0'),(725,'2000-10-04','Florida','Saint Petersburg','Saint Petersburg Police Department',1,2,0,'Unconfirmed','police gave this account: About 7:15 p.m., an officer was called to a report of domestic violence at 4228 Queen St. N.

Their owners had gotten the dogs as puppies. As the dogs grew, people who regularly passed on the sidewalk became accustomed to hearing them barking. Some worried they would get big enough to hop the small fence that bordered the yard. But no one foresaw what happened Saturday. About 3 p.m., one of the dogs apparently managed to escape and attacked a person walking in front of a house next door, according to St. Petersburg police. A neighbor helped escort the person to safety and officers soon arrived. They tried to coax the dog back into the yard, but it charged, police said. An officer fired a shot from his service pistol and wounded the dog. The dog was taken to a local animal hospital with a non-life-threatening injury, and its owner was notified, police said. It was unclear how badly the person who was attacked was hurt. The police did not release identities of the bite victim, the officer involved or the dog&#039;s owner. The incident stunned neighbors, who said the dogs are loud and somewhat of a nuisance.

Elizabeth Feichter and her family adopted Ciarra and her sister, Molly, from Georgia Lab Rescue when they were 10 weeks old. According to Feichter, Ciarra was a sweet and docile 65-pounder &ldquo;who&rsquo;s never even come close to harming anyone.&rdquo; Atlanta police spokeswoman Sgt. Lisa Keyes said the shooting is under investigation, adding, &ldquo;We emphathize with the homeowner&rsquo;s loss.&rdquo; Keyes said she could provide no furher information. Feichter, her husband, and their two sons were visiting family in North Carolina when the shooting happened in the backyard of their Howard Street home. Feichter, 33, who runs a philanthropic consulting firm, said she can&rsquo;t believe the officer had no choice but to shoot Ciarra. &ldquo;He could have said &lsquo;Stop!&rsquo;, he could have said &lsquo;Wait!&rsquo;, he could have pulled out Mace, he could have just stepped behind our garden fence, he could have fired into the ground,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Ciarra would have taken off and sat shivering in a corner. She&rsquo;s very timid.&rdquo; It was about 9 a.m. Saturday when the family got a call from the alarm company saying the alarm was going off. They couldn&rsquo;t immediately reach their house sitter, who had gone out for breakfast, so they called 911. Soon they reached the sitter, Hilary Stewart, who returned to find the front and back doors locked. Apparently, it was a false alarm. &ldquo;The officer pulled up at that moment, so I said, &lsquo;Let me talk to him,&rsquo;&rdquo; Feichter said. &ldquo;We spent a few moments joking because he was the officer who had come out when our cars got broken into six months ago. He said, &lsquo;No big deal, I don&rsquo;t mind coming out.&rsquo; &ldquo;Then he said he was just going to take a look around and make sure everything was safe.&rdquo;\r\nHe gave the phone back to Stewart. Feichter heard her say the dogs had gotten out into the backyard. &ldquo;Then she said, &lsquo;Oh my God! He just shot her,&rsquo;&rdquo; Feichter recalled.\r\nNeighbors rushed over. Ashley Derrick and Alison Grounds picked up Ciarra and drove her to the vet, but it was too late. In an email to members of the East Lake Neighbors Community Association, Derrick wrote that she arrived to find the officer beside the dog. &ldquo;I asked why he had to shoot her,&rdquo; she wrote. &ldquo;He could give me no answer.&rdquo;\r\nStewart could not immediately be reached; she left Sunday on a scheduled mission trip. And Feichter did not recall the officer&rsquo;s name. Feichter said her two sons, 12 and 8, are traumatized. She said she chose to speak out for one main reason. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want this to happen to anyone else,&rdquo; she said.','http://www.ajc.com/news/news/local/family-questions-police-shooting-of-dog/nQJRZ/','Ciarra','Unknown','0','0',0,0,0,'0','0','Uniform','1','2','0','0','2','0'),(732,'2008-12-02','California','San Diego','San Diego Police Department',1,50,0,'American Staffordshire Terrier','Mali, a 3-year-old American Staffordshire Terrier, balances her front paws on Demarkus Peeples&rsquo; thighs, gives him a long look then returns to all fours and takes a walk around the front porch of the North Park house where she lives with her owner, Ross Meyer. She walks back over to Peeples and does it again. She&rsquo;s got sparkly purple polish on her nails. Two days earlier, Peeples&rsquo; dog Egypt, also an American Staffordshire Terrier, was shot by San Diego police officers who say the dog came at them in a threatening manner. Egypt was hit three times&mdash;in the paw, lower leg and shoulder&mdash;and less than an hour later, she was euthanized by San Diego County Animal Control officers, who say Peeples gave them permission to put Egypt down. Peeples said he did no such thing. &ldquo;I told them over and over, &lsquo;Do not euthanize my dog,&rsquo;&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty sure she knows&rdquo; about Egypt&rsquo;s death, Meyer said, commenting on Mali&rsquo;s behavior toward Peeples.\r\nUsually lumped in with Pit Bull Terriers, American Staffordshire Terriers, or AmStaffs, have a reputation not as fighters but as loyal family pets. Peeples said he never had any problems with Egypt, except a complaint from a neighbor that she barked too loud. Egypt loved to play with Peeples&rsquo; 7-year-old son and 6-year-old nephew and would sit at the edge of Peeples&rsquo; front yard, waiting for neighbors to come over to give her treats. Like her dog pal Mali, she often had polish on her nails&mdash;Meyer&rsquo;s mom&rsquo;s idea&mdash;and a matching collar. She didn&rsquo;t so much like the manicures, but after they were over, &ldquo;she&rsquo;d run around with a little pep in her step,&rdquo; Peeples said. &ldquo;She was the delightful nuisance of the neighborhood,&rdquo; said Chris Victor, who lives across the street from Peeples. &ldquo;She&rsquo;d see you and she&rsquo;d wag from head to toe.&rdquo; But for all their friendliness, AmStaffs are inclined to protect their owners and property, which could be the reason Egypt went running toward the cops. Around noon on Tuesday, Dec. 2, Peeples was watching TV at home when he heard a knock at the front door. When he looked out the door&rsquo;s top window, he saw a group of men standing on his porch wearing jeans and T-shirts, a couple of them looking a little ratty. To get a better look, he went to a side window and peeked through the drawn blinds. &ldquo;Honestly, they looked like they were transients,&rdquo; he said. The men, it ends up, were undercover narcotics officers who were there on a complaint about drug activity at that address&mdash;Peeples was later told that it had to do with a &ldquo;chemical smell.&rdquo; Peeples said the men&mdash;he estimates there were six&mdash;never announced who they were. He decided not to open the door and watched as two broke off from the group and walked up the driveway that runs alongside the one-story bungalow he shares with his mom. The men opened a gate leading to the backyard and walked up to the back door. They started knocking and yelling &ldquo;Hello?&rdquo; through the locked security door, Peeples recalled. Peeples was standing in the doorway of a front bedroom where he could see the men but they couldn&rsquo;t see him. &ldquo;It looked like they were trying to case my house,&rdquo; Peeples said. Egypt ran to the security door and started to bark at the strangers. Eventually the two men left the back door and returned to the front of the house. Peeples opened the back door to take a look around; when he did, Egypt ran out. Normally, she&rsquo;d stop at the backyard gate, he said, but the men had left the gate&rsquo;s door open. With nothing to stop her, Egypt went running down the driveway and Peeples went after her. He heard gunshots and saw two men with guns drawn. Wounded, Egypt ran to the backyard. The men pulled out their badges, told Peeples they were undercover narcotics agents, handcuffed him and told him he was being charged with assault with a deadly weapon. A police cruiser pulled up, and Peeples was stuffed in the back. &ldquo;Charge him with everything you can charge him with,&rdquo; he remembers one of the officers saying. San Diego Police Department spokesperson Monica Mu&ntilde;oz confirmed that Egypt didn&rsquo;t attack the officers, but she said they were within policy to shoot her. &ldquo;The animal was charging the officers,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They weren&rsquo;t going to wait to see if [she] was actually going to bite them.&rdquo; Mu&ntilde;oz disputed Peeples&rsquo; claim that there were six officers, saying that narcotics officers work in teams of four. As to their attire&mdash;Peeples said he would have opened the door immediately and kept Egypt at bay if he saw a uniformed officer at his door&mdash;Mu&ntilde;oz said that&rsquo;s not the way narcotics officers operate. &ldquo;Narcotics teams work undercover, work in plainclothes,&rdquo; she said. She referred to what they were doing as a &ldquo;knock-and-talk&rdquo; and confirmed that officers didn&rsquo;t have a search warrant. &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t do any surveillance&hellip;. They went out to check out the complaint.&rdquo; Mike Marrinan, a San Diego attorney who specializes in police use-of-force cases, questioned the officers&rsquo; decisions, starting with having two undercover cops enter an enclosed backyard. &ldquo;People have an expectation of privacy in their backyard that they might not have in their front,&rdquo; Marrinan said. And, obviously, leaving the gate open was a mistake, Marrinan noted. Peeples told CityBeat that if the officers had closed the gate, Egypt would never have run out. Even more troubling, Marrinan said, is the fact that officers were so quick to draw their weapons in a residential area. Meyer, Peeples&rsquo; neighbor, said he heard five shots. According to a police dispatch log, a 911 call reported four or five shots. &ldquo;Bullets can ricochet,&rdquo; Marrinan said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got one relatively small dog, and we&rsquo;re shooting our guns five times?&rdquo; Handcuffed and in the back of the police cruiser, Peeples watched as an animal-control officer led Egypt, covered in blood, out from the backyard. From the trail of blood she left behind, Peeples later determined that Egypt had run up to the back door and then took refuge under some shrubs. Peeple&rsquo;s was approached by an animal-control officer who asked for permission to put Egypt to sleep, telling him it was the humane thing to do. Animal Control spokesperson Dan DeSousa said Peeples&rsquo; verbal authorization to euthanize Egypt was witnessed by a second officer, but Peeples insists he never gave permission. &ldquo;Do not kill my dog; do everything you can to save my dog,&rdquo; he remembers yelling. When he saw Chris Victor, his neighbor, he asked him to make sure Egypt was kept alive. Victor said he called animal control to let them know he&rsquo;d cover any cost for Egypt&rsquo;s care, but by the time his call got through, Egypt had been euthanized. DeSousa said the dog was put down immediately after arriving. Though the assault charge against Peeples was dropped, Mu&ntilde;oz said police have filed misdemeanor charges against him with the San Diego City Attorney&rsquo;s office, including not having a dog license, endangering the public&rsquo;s safety and possession of marijuana. A search of Peeples&rsquo; garage, OK&rsquo;d by his mom, turned up a scale and a tiny amount of marijuana so old that it disintegrated upon contact. Peeples went to pick up Egypt from animal control last Thursday. Victor and Meyer went with him. She was handed over in a clear plastic bag. &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t know she was a sweetheart,&rdquo; Victor said. &ldquo;Had they said &lsquo;sit,&rsquo; she would have sat.&rdquo;','http://www.sdcitybeat.com/sandiego/article-6073-do-everything-you-can-to-save-my-dog.html','Egypt','Unknown Undercover Police (six)','1','0',0,0,0,'1','1','Plain Clothes','0','2','0','0','2','0'),(733,'2009-01-27','Florida','Saint Petersburg','Pinellas County Sheriff&#039;s Department',1,50,1,'Chow and Pit Bull mix 9yo','A Pinellas County sheriff&#039;s deputy knocked on Lee Ann Hutts&#039; door Tuesday night and her dog, Smoke, started barking incessantly. Within moments, the deputy pulled out a gun and shot Smoke in the head. That&#039;s about all Hutts and the deputy agree on. The deputy says Smoke attacked him, and he shot in self-defense. Hutts said Smoke was barking, but never attacked the deputy. An eyewitness backs Hutts&#039; account. Smoke died the next day. The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals is investigating. &quot;We have a call in to (the deputy&#039;s) supervisor,&quot; said Connie Brooks, a local SPCA investigator. &quot;You know, sometimes they see things a little differently.&quot; Hutts, 32, and her neighbor Tina Morrow said deputies came to their mobile home park on 28th Street N investigating a burglary report. Unable to find the right home, a deputy went to Hutts&#039; door. Hutts, who takes care of a disabled sister-in-law and lives with her fiance and roommate in her mobile home, said her 9-year-old chow-pit bull mix was barking when she opened the door but stopped when she told him to be quiet. She tried to put him in another room but he followed her out. Smoke kept barking but never left her side, she said. The deputy was agitated, she said, and kicked her dog. Then he shot him. &quot;I damn near passed out,&quot; Hutts said. &quot;I had blood all over me, I was screaming.&quot; The deputy left, she said. Pinellas sheriff&#039;s spokeswoman Marianne Pasha offered a different account based on an incident report from Sgt. Robert McGuire and a supplemental report from a backup deputy. McGuire, a 24-year veteran, wrote that when he knocked on Hutts&#039; door he could hear a dog barking. When Hutts answered, he asked her to secure the dog. The dog appeared to charge him, so he shooed the dog with his foot. &quot;He believed the dog was going to bite him,&quot; Pasha said, so he shot him in the head. The deputy was unaware that Smoke died. Pasha asked a reporter how the dog was doing and was told he had died. Hutts said she and her sister-in-law took the wounded Smoke to Noah&#039;s Place 24-Hour Animal Medical Center on 62nd Avenue N. Unable to afford the $3,000 she was told surgery would cost, Hutts left with a prescription for pain medication. She took the dog home and stayed up all night with him. Smoke died in the morning. Cathy Miktuk, the property manager at the mobile home park, Suncove Apartments, said the entire neighborhood is upset. Everyone loved Smoke, who barks a lot but was never aggressive, she said. &quot;We&#039;ve all got dogs, and a lot of us watched what happened,&quot; Miktuk said. &quot;Why didn&#039;t they just mace that dog?&quot; Miktuk called the SPCA Tuesday morning and helped gather statements from witnesses. The SPCA&#039;s Brooks said it routinely investigates when law enforcement shoots a dog. &quot;We&#039;d like to talk to the officer, because it&#039;s a complaint like any other complaint,&quot; she said. &quot;But we realize officers are out there protecting people.&quot; Hutts&#039; neighbor who watched the shooting is angry that the Sheriff&#039;s Office didn&#039;t check on how the dog or Hutts were doing. &quot;This was her family pet,&quot; Morrow said. &quot;He was a total sweetheart.

Almost embarrassingly so. When Jose Fernandez would have friends over, he would brag that he had a pit bull. He&#039;d take his friends into the backyard to see Coco and the 6-year-old pit bull would lick their feet. &quot;I&#039;d say, &#039;Come on! Put on a mean face or something!&#039;&quot; Fernandez, 40, said. But that&#039;s all Coco would do, he said. Lick them, or put his paw on their laps for attention. Around 5 a.m. Friday, Coco was shot and killed in his backyard by a Las Vegas police officer.\r\nThe officer was one of several who were searching for a DUI suspect who fled on foot from a traffic stop near Nellis Boulevard and Sahara Avenue, according to department spokesman Bill Cassell. Police searched a nearby neighborhood with a helicopter equipped with a heat detecting device and spotted a large mass in a shed behind a home at 4880 Welter Ave., Cassell said. Cassell said the dog, which was inside the shed, confronted officers. But he said he didn&#039;t know how the dog displayed aggressiveness. &quot;The officer did everything he could to avoid shooting at the dog. Ultimately he was forced to fire in self-defense,&quot; Cassell said. Two shots rang out. Coco had a bullet wound in his back and in his chest, according to Fernandez and his girlfriend, Yurisel De La Torre. Both were at work at the time. The suspect, whose name and charges were not released, was arrested a few doors away. Cassell said the dog&#039;s death was a mistake and the department offered apologies to the family. &quot;This is an extra unfortunate incident,&quot; he said. &quot;All cops are animal lovers and it hurts us deeply when something like this occurs.&quot; A next-door neighbor said she never heard Coco bark or growl at the officers. Sandra Orozco, 27, said she was awakened by seven police officers in her backyard around 4:30 a.m. The officers then jumped the wall between the two yards, she said.\r\nOrozco couldn&#039;t see the shooting while standing in her patio because the wall blocked her view, but she and her parents did hear two pops that she later learned were the fatal shots. She said Coco was &quot;always gentle&quot; and played well with her 5-year-old daughter. De La Torre, teary-eyed and surrounded by photos of the dog, said that was one of the reasons she adopted Coco. She remembers first seeing him at the Lied Animal Shelter three years ago. While other dogs barked and jumped for attention, Coco didn&#039;t make a sound. &quot;Coco just put his head right next to the door, looking for attention,&quot; she said. Coco let De La Torre&#039;s four Chihuahuas jump on him and bite his tail. When one of them became too rough, he gently nudged them with his paw. With her 6-month-old daughter, Coco would set his face in her lap and she would pull on his ears. Coco didn&#039;t mind, De La Torre said. He was just happy for the attention. De La Torre and Fernandez don&#039;t believe Coco could have harmed the officer and are upset that the officers didn&#039;t ask before entering their backyard. They also don&#039;t believe catching the suspect was worth jumping into their backyard and killing their dog. &quot;I don&#039;t think it&#039;s right,&quot; De La Torre said. &quot;It wasn&#039;t like he was a killer.&quot; Las Vegas police do not have official procedures for dealing with dogs because each encounter is different, Cassell said. Officers are just instructed to balance the risk to themselves and the public in such incidents. They&#039;ve been involved in other similar shootings. In 2005, while chasing a graffiti vandal, two Las Vegas police officers shot and killed one pit bull and wounded another that they encountered in the dog owner&#039;s fenced yard. Police said the animals chased the officers. In 2004, while responding to a burglary call, an officer jumped into a backyard and shot and killed a blue heeler-dingo mix that police said &quot;charged aggressively&quot; at the officer.

Tyree, 37, said she heard two pit bull dogs bark at her in the predawn darkness. She said she turned and saw the dogs standing in the middle of the street in the 3300 block of S.E. Colfax. In short order, Tyree said, the dogs charged at her. A short time later, a Topeka police officer fired two rounds, both of which struck and killed one of the &ldquo;vicious&rdquo; pitbulls. But before that happened, Tyree had to take quick action to keep herself and her baby safe. As the pair of dogs began to charge at her, Tyree said, &ldquo;I told them to go home. I guess that made them mad.&rdquo; Holding her 5-month-old son, Christian, in her left arm, away from the dogs, Tyree jumped on the hood of her car, parked in a driveway on the east side of S.E. Colfax. She used her feet to kick at the dogs as they tried to jump on top of her car, she said. Just then, a neighbor across the street saw what was happening and yelled out &ldquo;Go home&rdquo; at the dogs, who then turned and headed north on S.E. Colfax toward the man&rsquo;s house. Tyree said a police car arrived on the scene about the same time. She said the officer got out of his patrol car and was charged by the dogs. The officer, Tyree said, swung his baton back and forth three times, backing up in the process, before using his gun to shoot one of the dogs two times. The dog died at the scene. The other dog, meanwhile, took off running and police hadn&rsquo;t located it by 9 a.m. &ldquo;The officer didn&rsquo;t want to shoot the dog,&rdquo; Tyree said. &ldquo;It was his last resort.&rdquo; Cpl. Louis Cortez said at the scene that police had been notified of the pair of pit bull dogs running at large in the neighborhood, charging at people and preventing children from going to their school bus stop. At least two additional residents on the block were forced to seek safety on top of their cars when they were charged by the dogs, Cortez said. While police don&rsquo;t want to be forced to shoot dogs, Cortez said, cases such as Monday&rsquo;s incident leave officers no choice but to do so. He said the incident was the result of the dogs&rsquo; owners not taking responsibility and keeping the animals secured.\r\nCortez held four pieces of paper that had witness reports of the incident, all agreeing on the facts of the situation and stating the officer took &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; action. Animal control officials picked up the deceased dog, who died near the west curb in the 3300 block of S.E. Colfax. The Topeka Fire Department was called to the scene to help clean up the scene after the dog had been shot.

Of interest is the fact that police and media claim the dog was a &quot;120 pound pit bull&quot; despite the fact that male pit bulls weigh between 35 and 66 pounds. Flint police try to avoid lethal force with dogs whenever possible, but after a Taser didn&#039;t stop a 120 pound pit bull from attacking a 14-year-old boy in late June, they say they were left with no choice. Flint City Councilman Bryant Nolden said the incident happened on Sunday, June 22, while more than 1,000 people were at the Berston Field House for a weekly softball game. The Third Ward councilman said he is the volunteer director at Berston, so he unlocks the facility for the community to use from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. during the games on Sundays. Nolden said during the softball game, he saw a teenage girl walking the pit bull around the baseball diamond area. Nolden said the girl was having trouble controlling the large, leashed dog and he told her she should not have the animal in such a large crowd of people. &quot;She could not handle the dog. It was obvious, because the dog was pulling her all over the place, and a few folks, including myself, said, &#039;You really shouldn&#039;t have this dog down here. Especially with this many folks down here.&#039;&quot; Nolden said. Flint police and Michigan State Police were already at Berston to aid in traffic control after the softball game. Nolden said he requested a police presence after a number of teenagers began coming to the facility and fights broke out. &quot;We&#039;ve had problems with teenagers using social media to settle neighborhood beefs and we had a couple of incidents where we had girls down there fighting,&quot; Nolden said. &quot;That&#039;s why we were requesting the police presence, because of the sheer numbers and the amount of young folks from 13 to maybe 18 that are coming down. And they aren&#039;t coming down for the games, they are down here to start problems.&quot; According to a Flint police report, officers were conducting crowd control for the spectators when the dog broke loose from its leash and charged a 14-year-old boy. Officers first attempted to use a Taser on the dog during the attack, but the animal was unaffected. The dog then turned and charged toward the officer, who shot two bullets at the dog. According to the report, the dog continued, charging at a second officer who fired another two rounds, paralyzing the animal. Flint Police Chief James Tolbert said officers had to use deadly force on the animal after the Taser failed to work on the dog, because it posed a threat to the crowd after attacking the 14-year-old boy. Tolbert said the officers did not want to shoot the dog again because of the large crowd. Genesee County Animal Control came to the scene and took possession of the injured dog with the owner&#039;s consent. Chief Animal Control Officer Stephani Lazar said the center euthanized the dog. Lazar said some breeds of dog are just too much for some people to handle if they don&#039;t take the time to train them and keep them in safe and healthy situations.\r\n&quot;It&#039;s unfortunate. A lot of people buy these large-breed dogs with dominant personalities and they don&#039;t get them neutered and they don&#039;t train them properly and then they get put into situations where they can&#039;t handle these animals and then a person or another animal gets hurt,&quot; Lazar said. &quot;So these animals are set up to fail, and in the meantime not only do they fail, but they hurt somebody else.&quot; Lazar said some dog owners expect all breeds to have the same personality, but said that is not the case. She said the best thing a dog owner can do is to research their breed, get them spayed or neutered, and into an obedience class. Nolden said he is an avid animal lover, but believes the officers did what they had to in order to protect the crowd. &quot;I&#039;m a dog lover and I&#039;m on the Genesee County Animal Control Sub-Committee and I&#039;m really passionate about animals and their rights, but this dog was just really, really big and I do not fault the police officer for protecting the community,&quot; Nolden said. &quot;I could not have held that dog, it was that big.&quot;\r\nThe 14-year-old boy who was attacked suffered minor injuries and was taken to Hurley Medical Center for treatment, police said.

Police said the dog barked, lunged at the first officer and bit his handgun after the officer responded to a complaint in the 1900 block of West Bergan Street just after 5 p.m. Thursday. The attack reportedly came after police tried for several minutes to keep the pit bull at bay with a yard rake and lure it back to its owner&#039;s house with some food. &quot;It was just time to keep somebody from getting hurt,&quot; Capt. Phil Trent said.\r\nTrent said an officer first went to 1901 W. Bergan to help a 13-year-old boy and a 16-year-old boy who said the dog had them trapped in a car. As the officer approached, the dog ran behind a neighboring house. A few moments later, while the officer was asking a neighbor about the dog, it ran toward the officer and lunged at him. Because the neighbor said the dog might live at 1911 W. Bergan, the officer lured it to the backyard with some food. But as soon as the food was gone, the dog again lunged toward the officer. The officer drew his handgun and pointed it at the dog, which backed away for a moment but then jumped at the officer and clamped its teeth onto his gun, Trent said. After the officer pulled his gun away from the pit bull, the dog appeared to gather itself for another jump, and another officer who had arrived drew his .40-caliber handgun and fatally shot the dog.\r\nSouth Bend Animal Care and Control officers soon arrived and took the dog away. Police were not able to find the dog&#039;s owners or determine for sure if it lived at 1911 W. Bergan.

Note that the police shot the dog at the scene of a fire that destroyed the dog owner&#039;s home. The dog was in the owner&#039;s car while the fire burned. The dog jumped through the car window to allegly attack the police. The police used the opportunity to perform a warrantless search of the car where they discovered a small amount of marijuana, leading to a criminal charge for the owner. Two West Manheim Township Police officers, including the chief, were bitten by a dog while at the scene of a house fire in the township Monday morning. Chief Tim Hippensteel, who suffered injuries in the attack, was forced to shoot the pit bull, police said. It is expected to survive. Fellow police officer Sgt. Toby Wildasin was also injured when the dog belonging to a tenant of the burned home leapt from a car and attacked them. Both officers were treated at the scene for their injuries. The dog&#039;s owner, Christopher Adam Weibe, 20, of 31 Rickey Drive, is in York County Prison on $2,500 bail, stemming from the attack and drug charges, police say. Hippensteel was sent to the home about 11:20 a.m. for the fire and, once there, went into the burning house to search for anyone inside but was forced out by heavy smoke and flames, police said. Weibe and another person were asleep in the basement but heard Hippensteel&#039;s shouts about the fire and, with the pit bull, got out via a basement door.\r\nPolice say Weibe became argumentative and uncooperative when officers told him he had to secure the dog. Weibe put the dog in his car, which is missing a passenger-door window, police said. The dog jumped through the window and attacked Wildasin, biting his inner thigh and groin area, causing minor injuries, police said. Weibe regained control of the dog and put it back in the car. But it didn&#039;t stay there for long. It again jumped through the window, this time attacking Hippensteel and biting his right calf, police said. Hippensteel shot the dog once with his handgun. It was at that point that, police say, Weibe also got out of the car and shoved Hippensteel to the ground. Weibe ran away but was arrested a short time later when he returned to the scene. The dog was found nearby and was taken to a veterinarian for treatment, police said. Charges: Officers found marijuana, which Weibe took from the home when he fled the flames, in Weibe&#039;s car, police allege. They also found drug paraphernalia inside the home, police said. Weibe was taken to the county&#039;s central booking unit, where he was arraigned. He is charged with aggravated assault on a police officer, simple assault, resisting arrest, reckless endangerment, harassment, possession of marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia, police said. It&#039;s not known if he has retained an attorney. Police have asked the York County District Attorney&#039;s detective bureau to investigate the shooting to see if department regulations and state law were followed. The fire: Pleasant Hill Volunteer Community Fire Co. Chief Ted Clousher said the blaze started in an attached garage and spread to the house. Crews had the fire under control in 25 to 30 minutes, the chief said. Weibe and the other resident weren&#039;t initally aware if anyone else was inside the home. That caused firefighters to search the house twice. No one else was found inside, Clousher said. All told, five adults and three children were displaced, according to the local Red Cross, who is assisting them with food, clothing and a place to stay. A state police fire marshal is investigating its cause, Clousher said, adding it caused $125,000 in damage. The house is owned by a member of the armed forces who is serving aboard. He is renting the house and the residents do not have renters&#039; insurance, Clousher said.

Beard is accused of obstructing official business, and Brown faces two counts of felonious assault on a law enforcement officer and one count of resisting arrest.

Lieutenant Brad Connor of the Warwick Police Department told NBC 10 &quot;as the officer began to arrest the suspect, the dog actually charged out of the home and bit the officer in the leg twice. To protect himself the officer drew his firearm and fired upon the dog, striking the dog at least one time.&quot; The dog, a black pitbull named Diesel, suffered non life-threatening injuries after he was hit in the shoulder.\r\nNBC 10 spoke to Sean&#039;s girlfriend, who was at the home and saw the whole thing. She says that police were originally called to the house because a neighbor may have heard the couple arguing. While police were questioning Sanita, his girlfriend says that Diesel, who was inside the house with her, began getting agitated realizing his owner may be in trouble. At one point, she opened the front door to go back outside to see what was going on, and the dog forced its way past her and attacked the officer. She told NBC 10 that the dog has never before exhibited this type of violent behavior, but thinks he acted this way to protect his owner. Lieutenant Connor said that the officer did what he was trained to do in this type of situation, &quot;in this case, it was a large pitbull and the officer had been bitten at least once at that point and upon protecting himself he did what he needed to do.&quot; Sanita will remain held until Monday, while the dog is being held at Warwick Animal Hospital pending a vicious dog hearing. A police officer in Warwick is in the hospital Saturday after he was attacked by a pitbull, that he was forced to shoot, while on duty Saturday morning.

The officer was speaking with Sean Sanita, 19, about the call outside of the home as the exchange began to escalate the dog, who was inside the home at the time became agitated. The dog managed to get loose and started attacking Officer O&#039;Connell until he was left with no other option than to shoot the dog. Police tell NBC 10 that multiple shots were fired and that the dog was hit by at least one bullet.  The Warwick Animal Control Officer arrived at the scene and transported the dog to Warwick Animal Hospital for injuries that are non-life threatening.  NBC 10 reached out to Warwick Animal Control regarding the dog but they declined to comment.  O&#039;Connell is currently being treated for bite injuries sustained in the attack, but initial reports are that he should make a full recovery.

It all started at about four in the morning in July, 2009. Tallahassee Police Officers Joseph Azevedo and Mark Adrick arrived at a home in the 1400 block of Charlotte Avenue. The officers were there because Kyle Marshall&#039;s live in girlfriend for two years claimed he was going to harm her black lab Dutch and wouldn&#039;t return it. Marshall says it&#039;s not true and fallout from a fight. The officers claim Marshall ordered his dog Smitty to attack them.\r\nOfficer Azevedo fatally shot Smitty. &quot;The officers maintain that the dog attacked them and they were justified in using the force they used,&quot; said Cassandra Jackson, a spokeswoman for the Tallahassee City Attorney.\r\n&quot;In no way was Smitty aggressive,&quot; said Marshall. &quot;In no way did he look aggressive,&quot; he said. &quot;This was basically the officers not manning up to a mistake they made and covering themselves to keep their jobs,&quot; Marshall said.\r\nWhile Marshall admits he was rude to the officers and told them to leave his property multiple times, he says he feared for his own life after Officer Azevedo shot Smitty. He says he tried to close the door and get away, but the officers entered his home and Acevedo shot Marshall twice with a taser. &quot;They shot my dog right on my front porch and then came into my house,&quot; said Marshall. &quot;What rights do you have if you can&#039;t stay in your own house,&quot; he said. &quot;It was determined their actions were completely justified because they were in fear for their own safety,&quot; said Jackson. Marshall was arrested and charged with two counts of aggravated assault on a law enforcement officer, resisting an officer without violence and petit theft of the dog. He faced up to 30 years in prison. However, the state attorney dropped all the charges, noting &quot;the dog in this case does not meet the definition of a deadly weapon&quot;.\r\nMarshall then sued. Instead of going to trial, the city settled out of court with Marshall for $25,000. &quot;There was some concern perhaps the sympathy factor because of the dog,&quot; said Jackson explaining the decision to settle.\r\nWhile Marshall has received the $25,000 settlement, he says his legal bills were more than $40,000. And he said he sat in jail for two weeks.

However, the Phenix City Police Department says the dog made an aggressive move at the officer. Assistant Police Chief Robert Casteel says his officer was helping U.S. Marshals look for an escapee from Georgia. He says an informant told them the suspect would be at the Dillingham Street house. When they got there, Casteel says there were some people sitting in the back, including Westfall. U.S. Marshals approached them while he says his officer went to check on a shed that music was coming from. Casteel says U.S. Marshals asked Westfall to restrain his dog. \r\n&quot;Mr. Westfall was asked to take control of his dog and declined, and when the officer walked around from behind the car the dog made an aggressive movement toward him, baring his teeth and the officer fired one shot,&quot; says Casteel. Westfall tells a different story. He says his dog barked at the marshals and officer when they first arrived, but then calmed down once Westfall told the dog to be quiet. He tells News 3 the officer went into his shed to look around, and when he came out the dog barked twice. Westfall says the officer then pulled out his gun and shot the dog in the head from about 10-15 feet away.\r\n&quot;At first I thought it was a taser gun or something and then I looked at my dog and my dog&#039;s brains were hanging out. My dog&#039;s sitting there, he&#039;s panting- he lasted about 10 minutes before he died,&quot; says Westfall. &quot;Mr. Westfall may have been under that impression that the dog would be fine,&quot; said Casteel. &quot;But police officers get different reactions from dogs from other people because dogs can sense an apprehension whenever they arrive on the scene, and some dogs that won&rsquo;t bite anybody else will bite a police officer or people in uniform because they sense that apprehension.&quot; Westfall said his dog, a boxer, did not attack the officer and has never been an aggressive dog. &ldquo;My dog lives here, this is my dog&#039;s house. Somebody comes on my property; yeah my dog&#039;s going to bark at you. He has never bit anybody, and I don&#039;t think he would unless you hit him or kick him,&quot; says Westfall.

The following is the statement of the owner of the victim, who was handcuffed and forced to kneel in the desert while the police killed her dog: \r\n\r\n&quot;On July 4th I was driving alone with my service dog of almost 8 years of age, Dunkin&rsquo;, in the rear seat towards the middle. I was pulled over on I-17 after being tailed for about one mile. The cop was very close to the rental car I was driving which was a gray Toyota corolla. The vehicle was due back on Sunday and I had planned on returning it, then utilizing the airport shuttle to catch my early flight back to New York&rsquo;s La Guardia airport with Dunkin as my travel companion. I pulled over to a safe spot on the shoulder of the road and the cop opened the door and drew out a shot gun. He actually AIMED it at me. I could see his eye aiming and it made no sense. I was shouted at and told to keep my hands where he can see them. This seemed very strange and not at all common for being pulled over. I could hear shot gun cocked and I realized that something was not right. I obeyed his shouts to keep my hands up and I allowed Dunkin to continue sleeping in order to keep us both calm. I was ordered to get out of the car, walk backwards without looking, and was very confused&hellip; I was going further and further away from Dunkin&rsquo;. I was shouted at to kneel, yelled at and then immediately cuffed and put in the back seat of a cop car. I immediately told him that my service animal is in the back of the car and to please be careful with him as he is license in NY state and is official for my Multiple Sclerosis. The car was overwhelmingly hot and my MS symptoms began as I tried breathing for fresh air. It was getting hotter and now he was drawing a weapon to the vehicle. I was very frightened that they would kill Dunkin&rsquo; as they looked like they would do so with the weapons drawn so intently. The cop opened the rental car door which was nearest the I-17 traffic. Dunkin&rsquo; rested soundly on that side of the vehicle. When the door was opened, the cop let him get out of the car onto oncoming traffic. Dunkin&rsquo; got out of the vehicle confused. He ran into oncoming traffic, looking for me. His mission is to look for me, wherever I may be. As cars swerved and missed him&hellip; I screamed. I prayed and screamed at the top of my lungs for my companion&rsquo;s safety. The cop S.D Soto (who was the one who aimed at me through his shotgun, also cuffed me) walked to the front of the car passenger area. He pulled out Dunkin&rsquo;s fluorescent orange service vest and read the insert in his pocket which states that he is a service animal and he is protected under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. S.D Soto Read the facts, read my rental agreement (which was located on the passenger seat area) and continued to ignore my pleas for help and air conditioning. At this point a red headed cop was on the scene too, along with a thicker sized blonde-red headed cop. I will never forget their faces. One wore shades, the other had glasses and piercing blue eyes. They completely ignored my existence and did not check on me. Someone chased Dunkin&rsquo; and I told them that he would ONLY come to me. I begged and pleaded to allow them to let me call for him. S.D Soto told me to shut up and I was annoying him. He said that he would gag me next, if I said another word and did not cooperate. I noticed my wrists were really in a lot of pain and my body temperature was rising in the back of the car. Dunkin was nowhere to be seen, he ran off into the area where desert grows. At this point, I hoped coyotes would not get him. I was screaming for them to listen to my pleas and my proof that it was a rental and I do indeed have MS and need my service animal for my well-being. Again, I was shouted at while they walked around calmly with no care for Dunkin or my safety. My safety was compromised the moment they ignored me and Dunkin&rsquo;. They never read me any rights, and continued to walk around, ignoring how hot I was in that car. It felt like a fish out of water and I was gasping for air. Dunkin&rsquo; came back through the desert area to about 10 yards north of the vehicle which obtained me. I screamed again, and begged them to keep him safe. They again chased him, frightened him, and he ran northbound. I never saw my Dunkin&rsquo; again.\r\nAt this point the sergeant&hellip; Robert Hardt, was called to the scene. I was let out of the vehicle, still cuffed very tightly. I am 5 feet tall and weigh 110 lb&rsquo;s. I whistled in vain to call Dunkin&rsquo;.. I was not allowed to walk towards the area he has run towards. I was not allowed to move. I was on the gravel on the side of the road waiting for the cops to do something. I begged the sergeant to lead me, with the cuffs, or however he seemed fit, in order for me to be able to get to Dunkin&rsquo; to whistle for him. He told me not to worry and &ldquo;the dog will come back.&rdquo; A cop car came back with Dunkin&rsquo;s destroyed body in it. I asked an officer&hellip; is there anything left&hellip; the red headed one with the glasses and blue eyes shook his nod, indicating that there was nothing left to see. At that point, I began to mourn. I screamed and I screamed in shock. My hands were still cuffed. I was thirsty, the srgt gave me water from a water bottle he had in his car. Around that point, I was uncuffed. I called my friends and family in NY and AZ and no one answered for what seemed an eternity. I finally reached a friend in NYC and I screamed in agony at the trauma I had just undergone. The srgt called ambulance to see about my MS. They said to me, &ldquo;you cannot scream and cry in my ambulance.&rdquo; I refused treatment since I could not help my emotions of having lost my dearest best friend in this earth. They wanted to sedate me and start and IV on me. I refused this as I did not think I would wake up if I allowed them to stick a needle in me. Already they had violated me. A sheriff&rsquo;s chaplain was then called to the scene. My phone died, and I was able to speak to my brother, who was in Hawaii vacationing, through the srgt&rsquo;s cell phone. My brother was extremely concerned about my MS as he understands the close bond that Dunkin and I have shared for almost 8 years. I was in no condition to drive, I do not know who drove the rental back to the rental location. My belongings were put in a bag, I was put in a car with the chaplain and I continued to document my bruising by photographing my wrists with the time on the dash board. I grieved the entire way to the hospital asking the chaplain for words of consolation and he was speechless. The bruising on my legs from kneeling on the tar/gravel started to emerge when I got back to NYC. I have attached those pictures in a previous email. I was never cited for anything, I was never read any rights, I was not arrested. I ended up in the hospital and was given a sedative. I had x-rays taken of my wrists as the pain was excruciating to the slightest touch. My friend Andrea Barker took Dunkin&rsquo;s remains to the animal crematory where Dunkin&rsquo; was cremated. His remains arrive in New York in a few days.\r\nI have already felt the symptoms of MS which has been in full remission for 4 years. My left hand buzzes and tingles, my capacity to concentrate has diminished and my job is in jeopardy. I am a Master&rsquo;s degree student at NYU and begin a new class tomorrow. I have received 2 A&rsquo;s and 3 B&rsquo;s in the coursework I have achieved and I hold a position of Learning Specialist at the College of Dentistry. I am my sole provider and feel the stresses of this trauma impeding my rest, my work, my concentration, my spirit (which feels broken). I experience nightmares nightly and sever bouts of mourning.

But that&rsquo;s the sight he was greeted by after, police say, the dog bit three teenagers and lunged toward a police officer, who shot the dog twice around 3 p.m. Monday. &ldquo;I was just walking by and saw all the police, and then I was like &lsquo;I think that&rsquo;s my dog, what the heck,&rsquo;&rdquo; Lerma said near the taped-off crime scene Monday. &ldquo;She was never violent, she was playful. I just saw her this morning lying under the porch. She would get out sometimes, but she was never aggressive.&rdquo; The dog bites broke the skin, but the injuries were not serious, police said. Police said a 15-year-old boy and a 17-year-old girl flagged down a patrolling officer after the dog bit each of them on the ankle. The officer then tear-gased the dog, but it went around and bit the leg of another 17-year-old girl who was getting off a school bus. The dog then charged at the officer and another person trying to get out of her car. That&rsquo;s when the officer noticed she was foaming at the mouth and shot her twice in the head, according to police. The dog is being tested for rabies, according to police. Lerma said Canela had recently given birth to a litter of puppies, all of whom died soon after. He said his brother was most attached to her, and was worried how he would react. &ldquo;He was like someone in those rich people movies where they only have a poodle. He was like 10 times worse.

But the family who owns the dog, named &quot;Jack,&quot; disputed the claims made by police. A police report obtained Friday morning revealed new details about the incident. The dog reportedly acted aggressively toward two teenagers, a man and a plain-clothes detective that was driving by before being flagged down. Two teenage girls and a man living in the area told police a black dog had ran aggressively toward each of them around 5:30 p.m., first the girls, then the man, the report states. The girls, who were jogging, had seen a white dog first. They approached what seemed to be a lost and friendly dog, the report states. That&#039;s when, according to the police report, the black dog &quot;came out of nowhere&quot; at them, barking. The girls avoided the dog by climbing on a small rock wall, then the dog turned its attention to the man who was walking to get his mail. The dog was &quot;aggressively barking&quot; at the man, the report states, so he threw keys at the dog to scare it. That man then noticed plain-clothes LCPD detective Rick Garcia pulling into the neighborhood and asked him to call animal control. Garcia, after calling for animal control, said he tried to shoo the black dog away, then corral it into a nearby yard. Neither tactic worked, the report states, so Garcia said he tried to back away. When he did, &quot;the dog lunged at him for a third time,&quot; barking and with teeth bared. That&#039;s when Garcia said he fired two shots, hitting the dog near the head and back. Kelcy Wilcox, whose family owned the approximately 4-year-old dog, adamantly denied that Jack, the mostly black Catahoula mix was aggressive. She said the dog would have reacted the way it did because it was frightened. &quot;He&#039;s not an aggressive dog,&quot; said Wilcox, a New Mexico State University graduate who earned a degree in animal science, and has directly worked with the dog for about 2 1/2 years. &quot;He was extremely well mannered, well trained.&quot; According to a letter Wilcox wrote to the Sun-News, the family took the dog out publicly, to the Las Cruces dog park, Caliche&#039;s, St. Clair&#039;s Winery for Yappy Hour, Andele&#039;s Dog House and High Desert Brewing Co. By the time the animal control officer arrived, the report states, a roommate of the dog&#039;s owner arrived. They tried to look for the white dog, which had fled. The animal control officer reportedly found it in its yard, around the block from where the black dog died. As he approached that yard, a neighbor warned him to beware of the black dog living there because it &quot;was a crazy dog,&quot; according to the report. &quot;All he did was growl,&quot; Wilcox said. &quot;That is a warning and not a reason to shoot him.&quot; The adult man and two teenage girls who the police said were being harassed by the dog were not injured. As per departmental policy related to the duty-related discharge of a firearm, the multi-agency task force will investigate the shooting. The task force includes investigators from New Mexico State Police, the Do&ntilde;a Ana County Sheriff&#039;s Office, New Mexico State University Police and Las Cruces police. The task force reports its findings to the 3rd Judicial District Attorney&#039;s Office. Garcia, a 16-year-veteran of LCPD, is not subject to standard administrative leave, as happens in shootings involving people, LCPD Sgt. Roberto Gutierrez said this week. Dr. Patricia Norris, the Do&ntilde;a Ana County Sheriff&#039;s Office veterinarian, was to perform a necropsy of the dog, the police report states.','http://www.lcsun-news.com/las_cruces-news/ci_25128392/las-cruces-police-officer-shoots-kills-dog','Jack','Rick Garcia','1','0',0,0,0,'0','2','Plain Clothes','3','3','0','0','2','0'),(786,'2014-07-07','New Mexico','Las Cruces','Las Cruces Police Department and Officer involved Incident Task Force',1,10,0,'Terrier Mix',' A Las Cruces police officer shot and killed a terrier mix Monday morning.  The dog&#039;s owners told KFOX14 that the police shouldn&#039;t have done that. Dan Trujillo, a spokesman for the Las Cruces Police Department said just before 11 a.m. Monday officers responded to a report of a vicious dog in the 1000 block of Larry Drive. When they arrived they discovered that the dog had bitten or attacked a 79-year-old man who resides near the owners of the canine, said police spokesman Dan Trujillo. According to Trujillo the dog approached the police officer &quot;aggressively.&quot; The dog allegedly pinned the officer against his unit. The officer is believed to have fired at least one round which struck the dog. However, the owners, Marin Serna and his fiancee Sonia Gonzalez said their dog Mac was too small to pin an officer. They said their dog was wrongfully shot and the victim of breed discrimination. Gonzalez said the officer should not have had to use his gun to restrain a 30 pound dog. An Animal Control officer took the dog to a local veterinarian where the dog was pronounced dead. Injuries to the 79-year-old man who was bit or attacked by the dog were non-life-threatening. Investigators are also looking into the possibility that the dog may have attacked someone else earlier in the day. Trujillo said, &quot;Right now the Las Cruces Police Department and our Officer involved Incident Task Force, which is made up of agencies throughout the area, are jointly investigating this shooting.&quot; He said they investigate any officer-related shooting that occurs on duty. The dog did have a history of getting out of the yard but not for being aggressive.  Officials said the owner has been cited two times in the past 12 months for the dog getting out. According to Trujillo, animal control keep specific numbers on dog attacks but they do keep numbers on vicious animal calls.

News that the department is considering tranquilizer guns, however, brought little consolation to the dead dog&#039;s owner, Harold Mason. Mason is a retired Delaware County 911 dispatch supervisor and currently serves on the Muncie Board of Works, appointed there by Mayor Sharon McShurley. Mason believes that even without tranquilizers, the officers had alternatives to deadly force, including tear gas and Tasers. He criticized the officers for using their guns to break up a dog fight and questioned whether his dog was the victim of breed discrimination. &quot;The only reason they shot my dog is because he is a pit bull,&quot; Mason said. &quot;If you run up on a Chihuahua and poodle and the Chihuahua has got the poodle around the neck, are you going to shoot the Chihuahua? It was a dog fight. Dogs fight.&quot;\r\nHAROLD! you&#039;re a fucktard! if your pit fighter was fighting another pit fighter your idiotic comment would have some credibility. but this situation is the equivalent to an adult beating up a child. Barrett, however, defended the shooting, saying the officers did the best they could in the situation. Barrett was not on the scene but has reviewed corresponding reports. &quot;Based on what I know right now, I would say they did what they should do,&quot; Barrett said. &quot;You have to take all the possibilities into account.&quot; Mason&#039;s dog, a six-year-old brown pit-bull named Bishop, was killed about 11:30 p.m. on July 30. Earlier that evening, Bishop had gotten loose from Mason&#039;s back yard along North Gavin Street, where he kept the dog on a cable, and apparently sauntered over to a neighbor&#039;s house on nearby Lowell Street. &quot;This dog is not a vicious dog,&quot; said Mason, who sort of inherited Bishop from his son. The neighbor had befriended Bishop, Mason said, and her porch had become the pit bull&#039;s home away from home. On this night, however, the neighbor had tied a German shepherd to her front porch, having found it wandering the neighborhood earlier, Mason said. A fight between the dogs ensued and, according to police reports, Bishop sunk his teeth into the German shepherd&#039;s neck. Muncie police officers Kristopher Duncan, Chris Kirby and Shane Finnegan responded to the fight after the neighbor called 911. Kirby said he considered rubbing hand sanitizer into Bishop&#039;s mouth to get it to release, but that the dog was angry and wouldn&#039;t let the officers get close. To save the German shepherd, the officer said, he had to shoot the pit bull. &quot;I&#039;m a dog lover. I hate what happened,&quot; Kirby said. &quot;I hate it. It just breaks my heart. If I had another alternative, I would have used it.&quot; Kirby&#039;s first shot struck Bishop in the side, but according to police reports the dog continued to fight. Kirby and Finnegan fired several more shots before Bishop left the scene, apparently mortally wounded. Kirby tracked him down to a neighboring back yard where he euthanized the dog with a shot to the head. While police reports available to the media did not indicate exactly how many shots were fired, Mason said he heard eight as he ran to the scene of the fight. &quot;That&#039;s what concerns me is to shoot at a dog eight times in a residential area,&quot; Mason said. Mason showed The Star Press a nearby home that had at least four holes in its vinyl siding that appeared to be from gunfire. The neighbors told The Star Press that at least three of the holes were not there before the police shot at the dog. Barrett said police believe one of the holes came from the officers, though the department is not sure whether the bullet ricocheted or struck the house directly. &quot;They weren&#039;t just recklessly firing rounds into the air,&quot; Barrett said. Kirby, who estimated seven shots were fired, said as far as he knew none struck the house. &quot;We were close enough on every shot that every shot went into the dog,&quot; he said. After the chaos died down, animal control came and took away both dogs. Kirby -- who is currently providing foster care for an abandoned pit bull until a rescue group can find her a home -- reported that the German shepherd had lost a lot of blood but appeared as if it would recover. The flip side of this story is that they may have saved the German shepherd&#039;s life,&quot; Barrett said. Mason wasn&#039;t so sure. &quot;All they had to do was wait for me,&quot; he said. &quot;I could have got my dog.&quot; Mason met with Police Chief Deb Davis in the days after the shooting. (Davis referred questions to Barrett). &quot;I&#039;m not trying to get anybody in trouble,&quot; he said. &quot;I just don&#039;t want this to happen to anyone else.&quot; Barrett told The Star Press that the department&#039;s decision to pursue tranquilizer guns was not influenced by Mason&#039;s status in Muncie. &quot;It&#039;s not just about Harold or who it is,&quot; Barrett said. &quot;This is a scenario that we are coming onto more recently.&quot; The department has been looking at a tranquilizer gun that cost $227 and is considering buying three of them. It is unclear if and when the department might actually buy the guns and make them available to officers. The tranquilizer guns would likely stay in the cars belonging to uniform shift supervisors. If available, the supervisor would be dispatched directly to all animal fight or vicious animal calls. &quot;That&#039;s something we would put into our protocol,&quot; Barrett said.\r\nBarrett said he believed officers would welcome the tranquilizer guns so that they wouldn&#039;t have to resort to their firearms. He said officers are emotionally affected any time they have to take a life, even a dog&#039;s life.','http://www.thestarpress.com/article/20100807/NEWS01/8070329/Officers-kill-pit-bull-MPD-to-consider-dart-guns','Bishop','Chris Kirby, Kristopher Duncan and Shane Finnegan','1','0',0,0,0,'0','2','Uniform','3','0','0','0','2','0'),(788,'2014-02-26','New Mexico','Las Cruces','Border Patrol and Las Cruces Police Department',1,2,0,'Mixed','A Border Patrol agent has been jailed after a late night incident Wednesday in which police allege he threatened his family with a gun, shoved his wife then fatally shot the family dog. Carmelo Diaz Jr., 44, has been charged with three felonies &mdash; two counts of aggravated assault against a family member and extreme animal cruelty &mdash; plus misdemeanor battery against a household member, according to a Las Cruces Police Department news release. Diaz, of the 2500 block of Kentwood Court, is being held at the Do&ntilde;a Ana County Detention Center. His wife told police that Diaz became upset when she declined to kiss him, grabbing her by the neck and pinning her to a kitchen wall, according to a criminal complaint filed in Magistrate Court. Diaz then ran upstairs and &quot;threatened to take his own life,&quot; the complaint states. His wife followed, eventually finding him in the bathroom, but not before he allegedly pushed her to the ground. Diaz was armed with a .40-caliber handgun, according to the news release. Frightened, Diaz&#039;s wife fled to his teenage son&#039;s room. Diaz allegedly followed her, then pointed the gun at her face. Later, he allegedly pointed the gun at his teenage son, the complaint states, while saying, &quot;I don&#039;t give a (expletive). I&#039;ll kill everybody.&quot; Eventually Diaz&#039;s wife and two children ran to a neighbor&#039;s house. Diaz&#039;s wife told police that Diaz rang the doorbell, asking about who they were calling on the phone, the complaint states. Diaz reportedly told his son to &quot;tell dispatch everything&#039;s OK,&quot; the complaint states. Diaz then walked away, and that&#039;s when police allege he shot the family&#039;s mixed-breed dog. A veterinarian determined the dog was paralyzed, according to the LCPD news release, and it was euthanized. Police responded to the family&#039;s home about 8:30 p.m. Wednesday after a call about a domestic disturbance. Diaz reportedly drove away in his silver Toyota Camry before LCPD officers arrived.\r\nLater, officers located Diaz&#039;s car parked on White Sage Arc. Police found a shell casing near Diaz&#039;s car &mdash; he apparently shot his cell phone, breaking it and a car window. Officers later blocked many of the streets in the Sonoma Ranch and Northrise area while conducting a search for Diaz, according to scanner traffic Wednesday. A nearby gym was locked down during portions of the search. An officer at the family&#039;s home saw Diaz hiding in the shadows, according to scanner traffic. Officers ordered him to drop the handgun which he did before being taken into custody. A Border Patrol spokesman confirmed Thursday that Diaz is an agent with the federal agency.\r\nDuring his video arraignment Thursday in Magistrate Court, Diaz said he had been working for Border Patrol for nearly four years. The Border Patrol&#039;s communications department released a statement on the matter to the Sun-News: &quot;The Border Patrol takes every allegation of misconduct seriously. While a comment specific to this event cannot be made due to an ongoing investigation by another jurisdiction, the Border Patrol will cooperate fully with any investigation. The Border Patrol understands its responsibility to maintain the trust of the community in which we serve and does not tolerate any activity by any of its personnel that may jeopardize that trust.&quot; Generally, agents facing felony charges are subject to suspension or administrative leave, said Border Patrol special operations supervisor Joe Romero in an email. &quot;It depends on different variables as each case is looked at independently,&quot; Romero said.

This week it was reported that sergeant Barry Antwine was charged with &ldquo;laying out poison for domestic animals&rdquo;, after his neighbors filed a complaint. Prosecutors say Antwine  put  a substance -- possibly anti-freeze -- in a bowl in front of his house in early April.\r\nThe investigation began when a complaint was filed by a neighbor claiming  Antwine had poisoned several dogs. Officers say at least six dogs died. A vet we spoke to said he treated two dogs that died after ingesting anti-freeze. On April 7, Antwine was put on paid administrative leave pending the investigation. Chief Ken Grace says he will remain on leave until the case is resolved. This is not the first time Antwine has been arrested either. In 2013, when he was a school resource officer, it came to light that he was arrested under the charges of second degree rape and molestation while he attended Wagoner High School in 1997. An affidavit shows that a 14-year-old girl accused Antwine of touching her inappropriately while they were in class, to which Antwine admitted doing so. Antwine then entered into an agreement of deferred prosecution with the State of Oklahoma that stated charges would not be filed if he met the conditions of the agreement for four years.

What went unexplained was where the tame buck may have originated. Powhatan Point resident Heidi Brown offered a likely explanation for the animal, often referred to as Bucky. &quot;I believe that this deer once belonged to my late father-in-law, Marvin Brown. After the fawn&#039;s mother had been hit by a car, Marvin rescued and raised the young deer,&quot; Brown wrote in a letter. She said the deer was amazing to see, behaving like a dog by playing with children, greeting visitors, following Marvin Brown around and even enjoying car rides. &quot;On November 18, 2013, Marvin was shot and killed,&quot; Brown went on to say. &quot;A few days after Marvin&#039;s murder, his deer ran away. The deer was wearing an orange collar for his own protection during hunting season. But, given his friendly nature, we did not expect the young deer to survive for very long, especially without Marvin to care for him.&quot; When Bucky wandered into Clarington several months ago, he was wearing an orange collar. The small village is just seven miles from Brown&#039;s home in Powhatan Point, and the age of the buck in question seems to fit the timeline. Brown stated that she was relieved to read about residents caring for Bucky, calling it &quot;heart-warming.&quot; &quot;Although it was devastating to learn that the little guy was put down, I am grateful to the people in Clarington who cared so much for him during his short life.&quot; Meanwhile, outrage over ODNR&#039;s decision to kill Bucky has continued to grow. Online news outlets have reported on the issue, while animal rights activists and others have jumped in to criticize ODNR on its Facebook page. There was even a yousign.com petition to fire the officer who shot Bucky in the public park near the edge of Clarington. As of Wednesday afternoon, it had received 3, 052 signatures, but on Thursday afternoon the petition had been deleted. Much of the outrage centers around the fact that the deer was killed in front of two young girls who had fed and pet him. Bucky is also connected to a petition on change.org labeled &quot;Support Trooper&#039;s Law &amp; Make Compassion Legal! Protect Animal Wildlife &amp; Stop the Killing!&quot; The petition calls for the state to allow willing and licensed rehabilitation experts, veterinarians and caretakers to provide appropriate care for injured wildlife, such as deer or raccoons. &quot;The hands of our veterinarians have been tied by the government. They are not permitted to treat certain wildlife such as an injured fawn...and, they [ODNR] threaten compassionate caretakers with arrest, jail time and fines,&quot; the petition says. Clarington resident Sandy Potts, whose yard was frequently visited by Bucky, had this to say about the petition. &quot;Although we lost our Bucky to the cruelty of the ODNR, his death has brought a national spotlight to our cause. The people at saving Trooper were working with us to help save Bucky and we need to support them so this law is passed and never happens again,&quot; she wrote on her Facebook page. The controversy reached the Ohio Humane Society, whose director, Corey Roscoe, sent a letter to Scott Zody, Chief of the Ohio Division of Wildlife. Roscoe expressed disappointment with ODNR&#039;s decision, and said that many Ohio residents have placed distressed calls to his agency. &quot;This did not appear to be a case of illegal possession, but rather of a habituated deer who was not sick or exhibiting threatening or dangerous behavior. We...agree that it would have been best for him as well as the public that this conditioning be broken, but a non-lethal approach should have been tried before the rather arbitrary decision to kill the animal was made,&quot; Roscoe wrote. He went on to say he would welcome a meeting with ODNR staff to discuss protocol and resources for situations like these in the future.','http://www.timesleaderonline.com/page/content.detail/id/561380/New-light-shed-on-deer-s-origins.html?nav=5010','Bucky','Unknown','1','0',2,0,0,'3','3','Uniform','3','3','0','0','0','0'),(799,'2014-09-09','Nevada','Las Vegas','Las Vegas Police Department',1,2,0,'Unconfirmed','Las Vegas police shot and killed a dog Tuesday afternoon after receiving calls that it was attacking someone.

I live with my wife Ginger and our two small children in Mason County, West Virginia. On June 24, 2014 the WV State Police Special Response Team shot and killed our dog. The WVSP were searching for a man named Jonathan Jeffers, who they allege shot at an officer while he responded to a domestic violence call. Mr. Jeffers fled from the police and ended up in the woods near our house. We live in a very rural, and secluded area near Milton, WV. My wife Ginger was at home with our two small children, RaeLee and Avery. The morning of the 24th she noticed a local sheriffs vehicle in our driveway. She let me know, and I made the decision to call the sheriffs office as this was way out of the ordinary. They noted that I called, but didn&#039;t provide any information as to why they were on our property. Over the next two hours, the police presence increased, including a helicopter flying overhead. I called the sheriffs office again to make sure they knew that my wife and children were home. At that time they explained that they were actively searching for a fugitive, and they would alert the officers that my family was inside our home.\r\nAt approximately 1pm my wife put our oldest daughter down for her daily nap in the nursery. When she came out she noticed 6-8 men dressed as soldiers come out of the woods and into the gravel road in front of our home with a K9. Our dog Willy Pete, a six year old beagle/basset mix was asleep on his pillow right outside our front door, and directly beneath the window that Ginger was watching from. The K9 unit was \r\nbarking when Ginger watched Willy Pete get up and leave the porch toward the officers. Ginger watched as one of the men raised his rifle towards Pete. She immediately ran outside to the top of the steps of our porch and began screaming for them to not shoot our dog as he would not hurt them. A shot was fired and Ginger saw a plume of dust come up from our yard between our dog and the officers. My dog being very afraid of guns (we live in an area with a lot of hunters) immediately turned around to run for Ginger, who was still desperately yelling for them to stop when they fired 3 more times. Willy Pete ran behind our house while Ginger ran through it to the back door. She saw Pete on the ground gasping for air and watched him die next to our air conditioning unit. Moments later an officer came into our house. Ginger was literally in the floor sobbing begging to know why they had killed our dog. He responded &quot;Ma&#039;am we couldn&#039;t let our dogs fight. We are dog people too. Where is your shovel so we can bury him.&quot; Ginger told them I was on the way home and she wasn&#039;t going to do anything until I got there. I arrived approximately 15-20 minutes later to a veritable sea of police officers and vehicles. My wife was on our porch screaming and so upset I couldn&#039;t even understand what she was saying. I was screaming at them asking why they had killed my dog when I heard Ginger say they \r\nhad shot towards her and the house (our younger daughter was in her chair in the living room by the window). I asked them why they would shoot at our house when the person I found out later to be the one who killed our dog grabbed my arm and cursed at me saying id better calm down before I got myself into trouble. Almost immediately they were asking me where my shovel was, and that they would do us the service of burying the dog. I told them I would help dig the hole, but I couldn&#039;t bear to look at my boy like that. Ginger and I gave statements to one of the officers and I began digging my dogs grave. The officers finished the hole and buried my dog. Before they left one of them came in and made an attempt at apologizing for what they had done. Ginger confronted him by asking why they shot towards her and our house. His demeanor instantly changed, and he left immediately. Several days later the WV State Police \r\noffered us a voucher from the Humane Society for a dog from a local shelter. We respectfully declined. Being on a very limited income, saying that we couldn&#039;t afford an attorney to represent us would be an understatement. We decided to use the only tool that we felt we had available and made efforts to get our story on local news media and the internet. Almost immediately we received an outpouring of support. \r\nThe WV State Police were obviously unprepared to handle the backlash and decided to make statements through their Facebook Page. These comments included the statement that reports of the dog being shot as it was running away were &quot;completely fictitious&quot;, and insinuated that we were inciting violence towards the police. All we did was ask for an investigation into the shooting. Based on these statements we decided to do the unthinkable and dig our dog up to have a necropsy performed. Several days later the WV State Police issued a lengthy press release as can been seen here . This press release is almost entirely false as it pertains to the killing of our dog. They claim that Sgt. S.T. Harper shot Willy Pete three times within 3-5 \r\nfeet as Pete continued to advance. However, we are in possession of a necropsy report which clearly shows our dog only has one entry wound and no exit. This means that by their own admission they must account for the other two bullets that are not in our dog. The WV state police are absolutely responsible for where we stand today. Ginger and I are left with the heartbreaking loss of our loyal dog that we watched born into this world. Ginger will live the rest of her life with the horrific image of him running desperately to her for help. We have had our sense of security taken from us, and even worse my families lives were endangered when that officer made the terrible decision to shoot at my dog. Thankfully our children and my wife were spared. The damage they inflicted on us is not something that will soon be repaired. We will one day have to teach our children about what they do when they are in trouble, and we want to tell them like our parents told us, you pick up the phone and call 9-1-1. \r\nUnfortunately, I won&rsquo;t be able to teach them that without the specter of these events flashing through my mind. Ginger and I have always been respectful of law enforcement, and refuse to give any credence to anyone who threatens violence against anyone brave enough to do their job. Ginger and I want our girls to be proud of the message that we leave behind. That message is that you stand up for what is right, even when it is against seemingly insurmountable odds. We have retained the counsel of Richard B. Rosenthal, General Counsel for The Lexus Project and Maxwell Hiltner of Mills, Mills, Fiely &amp; Lucas. We intend to pursue federal action against the WV state police seeking an injunction to require officers be trained on how to handle encounters with domesticated animals as well as establish a requirement for Independent oversight of future incidents. Nothing can give us our sense of security or our precious family member back, but we can take solace in knowing that we did what was necessary to prevent this kind of horrific event from disrupting another family&rsquo;s life. God forbid the next time something like this happens the consequences could be infinitely worse. Since this happened to us last month we have become aware of just how often this happens in our country. The WV state police have only kept records for 4 years on dog shootings. Based on those records they have killed 15 dogs including Willy Pete. Sgt. S.T. Harper is responsible for three of them. This is one police agency in WV in 4 years. We shudder to think of the numbers once police agencies all across the country are considered. Our Facebook page receives information on a new incident almost every day.

They found blood splatters on the floor of the landing and walls of a third floor apartment from which they heard a woman screaming for help. A tan pit bull was mauling its owner and the woman was by the wall with bite wounds on both of her arms. Police had to shoot the dog to save the man, Ladeairous said. The woman, who was the 38-year-old Port Chester man&rsquo;s mother, told police she and her son were arguing and when they raised their voices the dog went crazy and started biting her, police said.

Randy Green sued the Village of South Holland, police Officer Chad Barden and other unknown officers, in Federal Court. South Holland, pop. 21,000, is a southern suburb of Chicago. &quot;On Sunday, July 22, 2012, two South Holland Police Officers arrived in separate vehicles at the home of Randy Green between 9-10 am, to investigate a purported dog off-leash (at large),&quot; the complaint states. &quot;Upon information and belief, a caller had identified the dog at large as &#039;a big old gray dog runnin&#039; around.&#039; The caller made no mention of the dog being dangerous, vicious, or aggressive. &quot;The two South Holland officers arrived while plaintiff Randy Green and his family were asleep inside of their home, and where Mr. Green&#039;s Cane Corso dog, Grady, was sitting on the front porch. &quot;Upon information and belief, the chain holding Grady in the Green family backyard had popped, allowing Grady to be off leash on and around Mr. Green&#039;s residence. &quot;Both South Holland officers were equipped with dog-catching poles in the trunks of their vehicles, but neither attempted to use the dog-catching poles to capture the purported dog at large. &quot;South Holland officer Chad Barden stood, with his gun drawn, near the Green family home while the dog Grady sat on the front porch. &quot;The accompanying South Holland officer stood, leaning against his own police vehicle, approximately 100 feet away from Officer Chad Barden. &quot;The dog Grady walked past both officers on more than one occasion without incident, thereafter lazily returning to the front porch of the Green residence. &quot;At no time did the dog Grady make physical contact with either officer. &quot;The South Holland police officers stood outside the Green family home for approximately twenty minutes. &quot;At this time, the dog Grady approached Officer Barden again as he was standing nearest the Green family home.\r\n&quot;Shortly thereafter, Officer Barden shot the dog Grady three times for no reason.&quot;\r\nGrady, wounded, ran into the back yard and Green &quot;rushed outside&quot; to help him and take him to a vet. Citing an &quot;Expert Report,&quot; Green claims that &quot;video surveillance footage from the Green family residence revealed the absence of any charging, lunging or showing of teeth by the dog Grady and instead showed the dog Grady seeking &#039;greater distance between the officer and himself,&#039; displaying &#039;calming [body] signals&#039; by &#039;looking away from the officers and showing his [Grady&#039;s] flank,&#039; and moving in a &#039;trot.&#039;&quot; The family immediately &quot;took Grady to an emergency veterinary facility where Grady was treated,&quot; the complaint states. Meanwhile, &quot;South Holland police officers walked onto the residential property of Randy Green, including his backyard and other private areas near his home,&quot; Green claims. A month later, South Holland police delivered a letter accusing Green of having a dangerous dog. Green seeks damages for unreasonable seizure, trespass, intentional infliction of emotional distress, violation of the Illinois Humane Care for Animals Act, and malicious prosecution.

Dan Marocchi said his 2-year-old German shepherd, named Max, never attacked the officer and didn&#039;t deserve to die. &quot;The Ogden Police Department is trying to cover up a bad shooting,&quot; he said Monday. However, Ogden Police Lt. Chad Ledford said the dog lunged at two officers before being killed. &quot;This could have been avoided if he (Marocchi) controlled his dogs like he was asked to do,&quot; Ledford said. The incident began about 5:30 p.m. Sunday when police responded to a report of a man with a gun at Marocchi&#039;s residence in the 2400 block of Jackson Avenue. Marocchi, 67, believes he was reported to police because he answered his door carrying a handgun for protection because a long-haired man, whom he didn&#039;t know, was standing on his porch. When police arrived at Marocchi&#039;s home, they ordered him to keep his German shepherd and another dog, an Australian shepherd mix, inside. &quot;The owner allowed them to run out,&quot; Ledford said. The black-and-brown Australian shepherd mix, named Rusty, escaped and hasn&#039;t been found. The German shepherd charged at an officer, who was unable to deploy a Taser to subdue the dog, Ledford said. Then the German shepherd leaped at another officer, who knocked the dog down and shot twice with a handgun, killing it, he added. Marocchi said he never saw Max charge the first officer or any attempt by the officer to deploy a Taser. It only took a few seconds for Max to run from the house to a neighbor&#039;s driveway, where it was shot, said Marocchi, who believes that didn&#039;t allow for enough time for a second attack on a police officer. However, Marocchi admits he only heard gunfire and didn&#039;t see the actual shooting. Marocchi added that when he looked over at Max, the dog was dead in his neighbor&#039;s driveway and the police officer who shot him was about 6 feet away.\r\nThere was no report of the dog injuring any of the officers, Ledford said. Marocchi said he was kept handcuffed in a patrol car for about 90 minutes but wasn&#039;t arrested in connection with the initial man-with-a-gun complaint. The man-with-a-gun-incident investigation will be screened by the Weber County Attorney&#039;s Office to determine if any charges should be filed, Ledford said. Ogden police officials will also conduct an internal investigation into the shooting of Marocchi&#039;s dog. Police in Ogden also shot and killed a pit bull in January 2012 in the 1000 block of Patterson Avenue. In that incident, the dog reportedly approached officers in an aggressive manner.','http://e.standard.net/stories/2013/03/04/man-refutes-ogden-police-claims-fatal-shooting-german-shepherd','Max','Two Unknown Police','2','0',2,0,0,'0','2','Uniform','2','2','0','0','2','0'),(820,'2012-01-28','Utah','Ogden','Ogden Police Department',1,50,1,'Unconfirmed','An Ogden bystander was somehow injured as she stood nearby watching police shoot and kill an aggressive pit bull in her neighborhood.

Police were trying to determine if she was injured by debris from the roadway or from a bullet fragment after the round struck the pavement and curb. Three officers said they were in the 1000 block of Patterson Street about 2 p.m. investigating an incident when an unleashed pit bull charged at them from a nearby backyard. Officers said they ordered the 31-year-old bystander to get control of the dog, but the woman told them it wasn&#039;t hers. The officers, who were standing in the road, said the dog started to circle the three officers and &quot;bumped&quot; into one of the officer&#039;s legs, police said. The first officer deemed the dog a threat and fired a shot toward the animal. A second officer fired two more shots. The dog died from its injuries. No officers were injured. Police said the woman was treated at the scene and released. A Ford Taurus parked in the same driveway was also damaged in the incident, police said.

The dog, Copper, had been shot by a police officer in Radford&#039;s Bisset Park a day earlier during a response to a call about two dogs not on leashes. Radford Police Chief Don Goodman said that based on the report, the use of the gun was for the officer&#039;s safety. The dog was shot Thursday afternoon, when an officer was called to the park at 3:25 p.m., he said. Accounts of the story differ after that point.\r\nDeMasi, an 18-year-old Radford University student, said he and a friend were in a secluded area of Bisset Park down a slope, allowing their dogs to play by the riverbank. He said Copper saw the officer, who&#039;d approached from above, and ran over to greet him. DeMasi said the officer yelled for him to get his dog. But before DeMasi had the chance to make a move, he said, the officer shot Copper in the leg without further warning. Goodman said the officer, whose name wasn&#039;t made available Friday, was charged by the dog as he got out of his vehicle. The officer repeatedly urged the owners to call off their dogs, Goodman said. The dogs continued at the officer in an &quot;aggressive manner,&quot; Goodman said, so the officer drew his .45-caliber pistol and shot the dog in the right front leg. Both dog owners were charged with allowing an animal to run at large, which violates a Radford city ordinance, Goodman said. &quot;If the dog would have been on a leash, this incident wouldn&#039;t have occurred,&quot; the police chief said. DeMasi admitted that he had violated the leash ordinance, but he called the incident &quot;police brutality at its finest.&quot; &quot;There was no barking or growling, that&#039;s the thing,&quot; DeMasi said. &quot;They weren&#039;t at a full sprint; they were jogging toward him wagging their tails,&quot; he said. &quot;As soon as I see them, I start screaming. Before I could get any words out, the shot went off.&quot; The officer helped escort the dog to the vet&#039;s office, where DeMasi was issued a summons. DeMasi said going to the secluded area of Bisset Park is something he and his friends do at least once a week to give their dogs a chance to play. He said they&#039;ve never had problems before, because the spot is at a riverbank away from other people and dogs. A disagreement with another dog owner over the dogs being off their leashes prompted the call, DeMasi said. His biggest complaints centered on what he saw to be excessive use of force and a lack of compassion, DeMasi said. The officer had other visible weapons, such as pepper spray and a Taser, which should have been considered before the use of a firearm, he said. Further, DeMasi said, someone trained in animal control should have been dispatched instead of a police officer. Goodman said that routinely, such a situation would have ended with a warning or a ticket. The dog allegedly charging makes it a different situation, he said. &quot;He [the officer] probably would have just told him to &#039;put your dog on a leash,&#039; and we probably would have gone about our business,&quot; Goodman said. He also said that less lethal options, such as a baton, pepper spray and Taser are designed primarily to &quot;deal with combative people.&quot; Goodman also said that those weapons are used in close proximity, which is something the officer wasn&#039;t afforded. Any incident involving use of force is internally reviewed, to make sure policy was followed, Goodman said. No administrative action has been taken against the officer, and outside of the review, the incident, for all intents and purposes, is over, he said. DeMasi said he didn&#039;t feel that the officer&#039;s safety was threatened and doesn&#039;t want the incident treated like a typical dog attack story. &quot;It was a really messed-up situation,&quot; he said. DeMasi said his vet bill so far is $500 and his ticket cost him $150. Julie Magyar with Riverside Veterinary Clinic said the dog will have to recuperate but will be fine. The bullet went through Copper&#039;s leg and caused some damage to the elbow, she said. Magyar said the dog should be in a cast for six to 10 weeks.

The officer shot and killed a chocolate Labrador named Sonic at a residence in the Eastern Hills subdivision on Nov. 3. TPD spokesman Sgt. Brent Blankley said that the officer felt threatened and thought the dog was a Pit bull-Labrador mix. Owner Rebecca James said that her dog was an eight-year-old full-blooded chocolate Lab that never showed aggression. &ldquo;Sonic was an inside dog, we had just let her out to go to the bathroom and she ran up the street with a neighbor&rsquo;s dog that morning. She was a sweet dog who liked everyone,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That police officer shot an innocent dog four times. He shouldn&rsquo;t be on the police force, because to me, that is not a stable person.&rdquo; The officer was taking a break at 7:26 a.m. when Sonic and another dog, which the officers described as a Pit bull, approached as he disembarked his motorcycle, Blankley said. &ldquo;The large brown dog was snarling and baring his teeth while running toward the officer,&rdquo; Blankley wrote in a press release issued Tuesday morning. &ldquo;When the dog got within 13 feet of the officer, he had no choice but shoot the vicious dog for his own safety. He shot the dog one time and the dog fell to the ground, but got up and kept coming towards the officer. The officer shot the dog a second time to stop him from attacking him. The officer then shot the dog two additional times to stop the suffering of the animal.&rdquo;\r\nThe other dog left the property as soon as the first shot was fired, Blankley said.\r\nJames&rsquo; sister-in-law Tana James agreed that Sonic was not vicious. &ldquo;She was overweight. She was eight-years-old and had hip dysplasia so she couldn&rsquo;t leap, jump or do a lot of active things,&rdquo; said James, who manages a veterinary clinic. &ldquo;In all the years I&rsquo;ve been around her, I&rsquo;ve never seen any aggression. I&rsquo;ve never seen her growl or lurch at anyone.&rdquo; She said that the other dog is a Boxer named Izzy that lives next door to her sister-in-law and her husband. &ldquo;She is a small, white Boxer who just gave birth to puppies,&rdquo; James said. &ldquo;They were always together.&rdquo; Rebecca James had placed missing dog fliers around the neighborhood and received a call Monday from a neighbor who told her about the shooting. She has since spoken to other neighbors who said the heard gunshots, but no barking or growling that morning.

The children were playing on the neighbor&rsquo;s property with that man&rsquo;s grandson, when the shooting occurred Monday, according to Sherrill. &ldquo;I own a gun myself,&rdquo; Sherrill said. &ldquo;I can understand this up to a point &hellip; that they have to put animals down, but you don&rsquo;t do it in front of kids. I&rsquo;m an adult, and I don&rsquo;t want to see it.&rdquo; Police Chief Michael Freeman offered a different version of events, maintaining the raccoon was not shot near any children or dwellings by Humane Officer Barry Accorti, who estimated he shot the animal at least 70 yards from any house.\r\nFreeman said Accorti shot the animal after determining there were no children present. Accorti, the same humane officer involved in the kitten incident in 2013, followed the law, according to Freeman. &ldquo;The property owner set a trap (which was requested from the city) and called us when he had something in the trap,&rdquo; Freeman said. &ldquo;He gave us permission to take care of the animal on his property.&rdquo; &ldquo;Because a neighbor disagrees with it doesn&rsquo;t make it wrong,&rdquo; Freeman said of the incident.\r\nFreeman said the animal was shot with .22-caliber ammunition that was fired toward the ground. &ldquo;This is a highly-trained individual who can make deductions as to whether this can be done safely or not,&rdquo; Freeman said. &ldquo;He is a certified officer. Not somebody we just hire off the street, give them a gun, and tell them to go to it.&rdquo; Under Ohio Department of Natural Resources regulations, animals can be caught and then released or destroyed by a property owner, or permission can be given by a property owner to have an animal destroyed by another party, such as a humane officer. Accorti became a humane officer in 2012 after retiring as a North Ridgeville police officer with 31 years&rsquo; service as a patrolman, detective, SWAT team commander and lieutenant. Over the years he received many commendations. An adult raccoon and number of baby raccoons were removed by the city from the neighbor&rsquo;s property last week, according to Sherrill. It was June 10, 2013, when Accorti shot and killed five kittens in response to a homeowner&rsquo;s request for help in ridding her property of stray cats, which have posed a problem in the city. That incident occurred at a residence where young children were present but did not witness the actual shooting, which triggered protest from angry residents demanding Accorti&rsquo;s firing, threats of legal action by humane groups, and thousands of signers to online petitions demanding action, including Accorti&rsquo;s dismissal. Accorti&rsquo;s actions at the time were deemed appropriate by Freeman. The episode led the city to announce it would no longer dispatch police or humane officers to handle feral cat calls, and to the formation of a citizens advisory committee in hopes of developing a better means of reducing the city&rsquo;s numbers of stray or feral cats.','http://chronicle.northcoastnow.com/2014/06/10/parent-alleges-humane-control-officer-killed-raccoon-front-kids/','Unknown','Barry Accorti','2','0',1,0,0,'3','3','Uniform','0','3','0','0','0','0'),(828,'2014-03-14','Alabama','Mobile','City of Mobile Police Department',2,2,0,'Unconfirmed','&quot;My guess is when he walked up to this point here he went to go around the corner and saw them and immediately reacted, because they were after him which they&#039;re supposed to,&quot; saiid Mark Yeager.

Music told policestateusa.com that it was a Nissan Xterra from Virginia Beach, VA. As Music wrote in a blog post, &ldquo;I will not have that influence around my family,&rdquo; saying she was trying to do the right thing by making a report. The acquaintance was still on the property and Music had not let on that she had gone to talk to the police. Music wrote on that while she was providing officers with details of the stolen property, and the individual who had brought it over, she also explicitly told the police not to shoot her dogs. &ldquo;The puppy may jump, we have been trying to get her out of that,&rdquo; Music explained, stating that the dogs were friendly puppies.  She said the officers laughed and told her not to worry about it.  Unconvinced, she emphasized again:  &ldquo;PLEASE don&rsquo;t shoot my dogs, they are my babies.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ammo was just sniffing around the ground wagging her tail. And then she looked up at him, did not growl, did not bark, and before I could say anything he fired his weapon.

Her dogs, Ammo and Half-Pint, and roommate, Kyle Sewall, age 22, waited at home.  Sewall gave his account in an exclusive interview with policestateusa.com. &ldquo;I was waiting on officers to arrive, Ammo needed to go the bathroom and she had been whimpering for 15 minutes.  So I gave in and let her out,&rdquo; said Sewall.  &ldquo;The person who had stolen the property was outside cleaning the stolen vehicle with a shop-vac and while I kept an eye on Ammo I was talking to him playing it cool.&rdquo; He continued: &ldquo;About 5 minutes later is when the sheriffs pulled up, came flying in. Sgt David Little was exiting the vehicle and as he was exiting I noticed he already had his sidearm trained on Ammo who was just sniffing around the ground wagging her tail. And then she looked up at him, did not growl, did not bark, and before I could say anything he fired his weapon. Shot her point blank in the head,&rdquo; Sewall told policestateusa.com. &ldquo;I went to go rush toward Ammo and he trained his weapon on me,&rdquo; Sewall explained. &ldquo;I identified myself saying, &lsquo;I am Kyle, lower your weapon.&rsquo; He did and they allowed me to tend to Ammo.&rdquo; Ammo, the 10-month-old pit bull / mastiff puppy, had been struck in the head with a .40 caliber slug, fired by Sergeant David Little of the Jones County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department. While Sewall tended to the wounded animal, officers investigated the vehicle and arrested the man who was in possession of it.  Animal Control showed up and asked if Sewall wanted to euthanize the dog.  Sewall declined. Some time later, Music returned to the home after being allowed to leave the sheriff&rsquo;s office.  She found Sewall behind a kiddy pool with a strange look on his face.  He was cradling her puppy in his arms. &ldquo;They shot her,&rdquo; Sewall said. Music asked Sgt. Little why he had shot her dog, after she had explained to him and other deputies that it was a friendly, harmless puppy, and explicitly had asked him not to shoot it.  Music says that Sgt. Little denied that she had told him this, but that an accompanying deputy confirmed her account. Rather than continue to argue she quickly scrambled to make emergency arrangements to have Ammo treated by a veterinarian on a Sunday.

She was merely on my neighbors property across from my mothers home where they were kept confined since 2008. The deputy&#039;s prejudice against pit bulls lead him to react instead of investigate. He claimed Eden became aggressive after she was pepper sprayed, and began to attack him when he turned to enter his patrol car. Thus, turning to her with his weapon drawn firing one shot in which he claim was the shoulder. The Animal control officer was called after the shooting to find Eden lying paralyzed waist down still breathing. My dogs did not have a collar on them because they were fenced inside. It happened on a Memorial Day weekend, and I could not contact the Animal Control Office until Tuesday 5/29/2012. I have filed a complaint with the Sheriff&#039;s department, sent Eden for a legal necropsy. The Jones County Deputy suffered no injuries. My American bulldogs were fenced in a 10 X 10 on my mothers property. Prior to that they had full run of her back yard until the house caught fire Aug 2011, forcing me to put them in a small 10X10. I did not have them with a collar in their pen, and I did not have them with a microchip. Since 2008 they have only escaped the property twice. This last time they were on a parrallel street and the neighbor claim the dogs were aggresive to him and he called the Jones County Sheriff department. According to them, the dogs did not bite anyone, or destroy any property. Reportedly, they were barking aggressively at the other neighbors dog behind the neighbors fence. The deputy reported that the dogs approached him as he exited his patrol car to investigates the neighbors complaint. He then stated he attempted to close his patrol car door when the dogs approached him. He drew his pepper spray to shoo the dogs away is what he claimed. My male dog, Caleb laid down while the female Eden continued her approach then backed off. He stated he then turned toward his vehicle when Eden approached him aggressively, so he drew his weapon and fired. Hitting her in the shoulder. Animal Control was notified after the shooting to the scene. When they arrived on scene, ACO (Animal Control Officer) Jennifer, stated Eden was near death and paralyzed, but was still breathing. She stated that Caleb was stand offish at that point but he was captured and held at the animal shelter until Tuesday 5/29/2012. The ACO claim she did not have any knowledge of the owner, so she had to euthanize Eden. ACO Jennifer surrendered Caleb to my mother after verifying with my veterinarian that his shots were current. She later waived all fines and fees surrounding the event when she released Eden&#039;s body to me on 6/7/2012 We got permission from our employer in Dutch Harbor, Alaska to pick up Caleb from Macon, Georgia and bring him back with us on 6/12/2012. After speaking with Capt Mitchell of Jones County Sheriff, he felt his deputy responded appropriately. I asked him whether there were any reports of my dog biting anyone? Did the deputy have any training in responding to aggressive dog calls? Is the deputy qualified to determine an aggressive dog, or is their a hearing required? What is the departments policy for notifying Animal Control, and why didn&#039;t he wait until they arrive before conducting his investigation? Capt. Mitchell was unable to answer my questions. The ACO stated that Eden was found shot at the front of the neighbors car, and Caleb was found at the rear. That gave me the impression that the dogs did not approach the officer but he in turn approached them. ACO Jennifer claimed there were no records kept by her on her response to the call, nor did she keep track of what time she was dispatched, or what time she was on scene. If I wanted those records, I would have to go through the sheriff&#039;s department which she claimed she didn&#039;t have. I spoke to the clerk at the sheriff&#039;s department, and she claimed the person responsible for the 911 recordings was out of town. All in all, I am getting a run around from the sheriff&#039;s department to my veterinarian. My own vet documented that my dog was a pit bull until I showed him the certificate of her breed being American bulldog. I had them to correct all her records. Eden is currently getting a legal necropsy at Tifton University here in Georgia. Jones S.O. Incident Report reads as follow: On 5-25-12 I responded toXXXXX in reference to some aggressive dogs. Upon arrival to the residence I made contact with two large pitbull dogs under the carport of the residence. The dogs came out and walked around my patrol and approached me on the rear driver side.

I next closed the door on my patrol vehicle. I walked about 10ft in front of my patrol vehicle to speak with the complainant Tirrell Lester. He stated that the dogs were aggressive with him when he attempted to come outside. He stated they also went to his neighbors house at 146 and attempted to get at a dog there.

It happened a week ago in Kalihi after officers responded to a domestic call in the area. As police officers were about to leave, Bruce, a two-year-old Staffordshire Bull Terrier mix, got loose from his cage and lunged at the officers, and then got shot. When the family asked police if they could take the dog to the veterinarian, they were told to stay put until an investigation was completed.\r\nThe first thing KHON2 News asked HPD was why the family was forced to wait. We were told it&rsquo;s standard policy to do a thorough investigation after an officer fires a weapon, so the scene had to be preserved. So we then asked that if this were instead a person, would there be a delay in getting help? Late Friday afternoon, a HPD spokeswoman called back and said the officers made a mistake and should have allowed the family to get medical help for the dog. One week after being shot in the chest, Bruce looks almost as good as new, although there are some stitches that still need to help him heal. His owners still can&rsquo;t believe what they had just gone through.\r\n&ldquo;It was terrifying for all of us,&rdquo; said the dog&rsquo;s owner Kristen Butac. &ldquo;We never would have thought this would happen to us. He&rsquo;s our family, so of course we&rsquo;re going react the way we did. We&rsquo;re upset.&rdquo; Butac said three officers were walking outside the house when Bruce lunged at them. The first two managed to sidestep and avoid the dog, but the third officer fired a shot. An HPD spokeswoman said the officer described the dog as aggressive and vicious. When asked how much was the dog bleeding, Butac said &ldquo;well, to us, it seemed like a lot. I mean, seeing something like that, of course, you&rsquo;re panicking. You don&rsquo;t know what else could have happened.&rdquo; She said the officers would not let anyone leave the house, even as they pleaded to let someone take Bruce to the vet. But they were told nobody leaves until the investigation is finished, which took about an hour. Investigators found the shell casing, but they couldn&rsquo;t find the bullet, which made the family even more nervous, thinking that it could still be inside the dog&rsquo;s chest. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t know what other injuries he had, so we were just trying our best to just put  pressure on his wound,&rdquo; Butac said. After the family rushed Bruce to an emergency care veterinarian, they did get some good news. &ldquo;The vet said he was a very lucky dog. What happened was the bullet had entered and exited his chest. The only damage was to his soft tissues.&rdquo; The family plans to file a lawsuit against HPD.

According to the lawsuit, the Police Department unlawfully permits its officers &ldquo;to shoot pet dogs during the execution of search warrants even though there are no reasonable justifications to shoot the dogs.&rdquo; Walker and Cataldo were living at 6253 Rocky Mountain Ave. with their two pit bulls, Pinky and Blue, when North Las Vegas SWAT officers served a drug search warrant on Sept. 14, 2012, at the home near Carey Avenue and Hollywood Boulevard, according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit claims the dogs were running toward the backyard, away from the officers, when they were shot. It describes Pinky as &ldquo;just a puppy.&rdquo; &ldquo;The dogs did not bark, approach, or come into contact with the officers at any time,&rdquo; the document alleges.

They said they remember their pet as a large, friendly lap dog. Tulsa Police Sgt. Jeff Davis said the off-duty officer was walking his own dog in the 6900 block of East 18th Street late Thursday afternoon when the pit bull, which was loose, approached his pet. Davis said the officer felt threatened, so he shot the dog, killing it. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an unfortunate thing,&rdquo; Davis said. Grant Holm, 50, lives three doors down from where the shooting occurred. Holm witnessed the situation as he, his wife and their grandchild spoke outside with a neighbor. Holm said he saw Titus run from between two houses on the other side of the street toward him with his tail wagging but then shift directions toward the officer when it saw two other dogs. The officer was walking with a large dog on a leash and was with a woman who had a small dog on a leash, Holm said. Titus went to the large dog and appeared to be greeting the other animal from a submissive posture with its head down, Holm said. The officer pulled on his dog&rsquo;s leash, rearing the animal up onto its hind legs, Holm said. Titus then moved to fill the void created by the officer pulling on the leash, he said. &ldquo;The man, as smooth as you please, reached behind him, pointed (a handgun), put it up to the dog and shot it in the head or neck area, and Titus immediately went down,&rdquo; Holm said, noting that the officer didn&rsquo;t say a word before pulling the trigger. As Titus lay in the grass, moving his legs and yelping, &ldquo;he (the officer) bent down, aimed at it and shot it in the head with everybody in shock,&rdquo; Holm said, adding that the second and final shot sent adults scurrying to collect children and take them inside their homes. Holm said he took issue with what he believes to be the officer&rsquo;s unwarranted shooting of a friendly dog. Holm said he doesn&rsquo;t know why the officer didn&rsquo;t try to get Titus to stop, ask any of the many people outside if the dog was theirs, or simply holler for help.\r\nHe said he also doesn&rsquo;t know why the officer needed to walk over and shoot Titus a second time when the animal already was lying on the ground severely wounded.\r\n&ldquo;I might have seen it differently if they were fighting, but there was no fighting,&rdquo; Holm said, also saying there was no barking or growling. On Friday afternoon, Blazek and Slane were trying to cope with the loss of their pet. The couple, who have been dating for almost a year and live together, didn&rsquo;t witness the shooting. Slane, 26, said she was inside their home and Blazek was away when Blazek&rsquo;s brother, Joseph Blazek, let Titus and the couple&rsquo;s other dog into the backyard, which is enclosed by a 6-foot-tall privacy fence. Just that morning, however, Titus had found a way to get out through a small opening in the fence, Slane said. Slane said that was how Titus escaped from the yard. Nicholas Blazek, 26, said he has owned Titus since bringing him home as a puppy. He said Titus was large, weighing about 60 to 65 pounds, but was a friendly dog who would sleep in bed with them. He recalled how a friend with a 2-year-old daughter would come over and the youngster would ride Titus like a horse.\r\n&ldquo;He was just a big goober &mdash; a big lap dog,&rdquo; Blazek said. He said Titus had never shown aggression. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s never even been in a dog fight,&rdquo; he said. After Titus was shot, Blazek was ticketed for having a dog at large. The owners have the option of paying the preset fine of $75 or having a hearing in municipal court, Davis said.\r\nDavis, who declined to release the name of the officer, said he won&rsquo;t be placed on administrative leave because he was off-duty and the shooting didn&rsquo;t involve a person. Leland Ashley, a Tulsa police spokesman, said the incident will be treated the same as a citizen shooting an animal when threatened. Ashley also noted that the officer used his personal firearm, not a police-issued weapon. Slane and her boyfriend said Friday that they want justice for Titus and for the officer to be reprimanded. &ldquo;It was definitely an unjust, unnecessary, horrible event,&rdquo; she said.','http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/local/witness-owners-of-pit-bull-killed-by-off-duty-tulsa/article_400fc734-6d16-51cb-8748-e188852b8ab1.html','Titus','Unknown','2','0',1,0,0,'0','1','Plain Clothes','3','3','2','2','2','2'),(834,'2013-11-10','Georgia','Atlanta','Atlanta Police Department',1,10,1,'Labrador and Pit Bull mix 2yo','Last November, a dog in Atlanta was killed by a City of Atlanta Police Department officer. According to their Facebook: Justice for Jane Our Family Dog page, the family learned last week that the officer involved has been cleared of any wrong doing. After an Internal Affairs investigation, Investigator Art Nixon along with his supervisors, ruled Officer Brian Carswell of the City of Atlanta Police Department completely justified in murdering Jane in her fenced-in front yard on a quiet Sunday morning. This tragic story began November 10, 2013, when the family of slain pit bull Jane, Matthew and Kelley Rodriguez, was saying goodbye to relatives visiting them from North Carolina. During the excitement of packing, an 11-year-old girl accidentally dialed 911. Emergency dispatch called the family back, and the niece confirmed it had been an accidental call. An hour later police arrived at the house, where they knocked once without identifying themselves. Kelley was nursing her three-month-old baby upstairs, and thought the visiting family had returned to pick up an item perhaps missed during their packing. The family dogs, Jane and Lucy, were lying with her on the bed. Kelley shouted that she was coming to the door, and when she opened the door leading outside, the dogs ran out. At the time, the City of Atlanta police officers had their backs turned, but quickly turned around and drew their weapons. Officer Brian Carswell allegedly shot Jane from the gate, while the dog was on the steps of the home, several feet away. Another officer had his weapon aimed at Lucy. If not for the fast thinking of Kelley, Lucy, too would have been executed. Kelley quickly picked Lucy up, where she carried the surviving dog upstairs, where she feared for the safety of her family. &quot;I ran up the stairs to get my infant son as I was terrified, and from the upstairs balcony I started to yell, You killed my dog! Why did you come here to kill my dog!!!??? I couldn&#039;t believe what was happening!&quot; Both dogs were rescues, and very much loved by family and neighbors alike. These neighbors, who all knew Jane and Lucy, gathered outside the yard in disbelief. To make matters worse, the officers wouldn&#039;t allow anyone to come near Jane, not even to transport her for emergency treatment. It wasn&#039;t until more officer&#039;s arrived that Kelley was able to give permission to a neighbor to take Jane to a vet. By then it was too late. Kelley couldn&#039;t even be with her dog as she took her last breath. She had to remain with her infant, but was able to contact Matthew, who was on a charity bike ride at the time. Jane died from her injuries. &quot;I cannot express what we feel. We keep playing this over and over. There was no reason that the Officer had to kill Jane. She was a friendly dog, everyone loved her, and she did not give him any reason to feel threatened.&quot; Justice for Jane didn&#039;t happen with the internal investigation. The Rodriguez will now join the families of other dogs slain by police, and spread the word about just how often a family dog is murdered by police. Jane was shot by police in her own yard, while police officer&#039;s were at the gate, then denied emergency veterinary care until it was too late.

Richard Chrisman was originally charged with aggravated assault, second-degree murder and animal cruelty.\r\nHe was convicted in September of assault, but jurors failed to reach verdicts on the other counts. He later pleaded guilty to manslaughter in a deal with prosecutors that spared him a second trial. Judge Warren Granville sentenced him Friday to seven years in prison for manslaughter and five years on the assault conviction with both sentences to run concurrently. While noting that Chrisman was doing his job, the judge also said he went too far. &quot;Society entrusted you with the power and authority of a law enforcement officer,&quot; Granville told Chrisman. &quot;On this occasion, you failed to meet that responsibility.&quot; Chrisman was arrested after he shot and killed Danny Rodriguez, 28, and the man&#039;s pit bull when he and his partner responded to Rodriguez&#039;s home after a frantic call from his mother that her son was acting violent. Chrisman maintained the shootings were self-defense but his partner told jurors the situation had been defused before Chrisman opened fire. At his sentencing hearing, Rodriguez&#039;s mother tearfully pleaded with the judge to sentence Chrisman to the maximum of 15 years in prison. &quot;I feel so guilty,&quot; Elvira Fernandez told the judge. &quot;If I never picked up that telephone and made that call, Daniel would be alive today.&quot; Several police officers testified on Chrisman&#039;s behalf, calling him a good man who supported his colleagues and loved his job. &quot;I&#039;ve never seen him lose his temper on or off the job,&quot; Phoenix officer Matt Morgan said. Chrisman pleaded for leniency, calling the events of that day a tragedy. &quot;But I would ask that you understand that that tragedy reaches both sides,&quot; he said. Outside court, Fernandez said she was disappointed with the sentence. &quot;It just didn&#039;t seem fair,&quot; she said, holding back tears. Chrisman had the support throughout his case of the Phoenix Law Enforcement Association, which found his conviction to be a travesty of justice. &quot;Rich is kind of an unfortunate victim of the justice system,&quot; said Ken Crane, the union&#039;s vice president. &quot;He was just trying to do his job.&quot; During his trial, Chrisman described a chaotic scene in which his partner shirked his duties as backup while Rodriguez&#039;s pit bull became aggressive. He said that at one point, the dog lunged at him leading him to shoot the animal twice. Chrisman explained how pepper spray and his stun gun failed to subdue the suspect as the two struggled, and Rodriguez picked up a bicycle from the living room floor. &quot;He was going to smash my brains in ... I fired two rounds, center mass,&quot; Chrisman told jurors. Prosecutors accused him of being reckless and escalating the situation unnecessarily. Defense attorneys noted that Chrisman had never fired his weapon once during 10 years on the force and was defending himself. But Chrisman&#039;s partner, Sergio Virgillo, told jurors Chrisman was on a tear from the moment he approached Rodriguez&#039;s door, then pulled out his gun and pressed it to the suspect&#039;s head. Chrisman denied the allegations and accused Virgillo of not being there to help with the struggling suspect, who was high on methamphetamine, and at one point even taking a personal call on his cell phone during the incident. Chrisman was fired about five months after the shooting. Virgillo remains employed with the Phoenix Police Department. Chrisman had previously been caught on video planting a crack cocaine pipe on a woman - an event that landed him on the Brady List of police officers proven to have lied under oath.','http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/bastard/2010/11/richard_chrisman_phoenix_police_department.php','Junior','Richard Chrisman and Sergio Virgillo','1','0',0,0,1,'0','0','Uniform','1','2','1','1','2','1'),(836,'2013-08-15','Massachusetts','Leominster','Leominster Police Department',1,2,0,'Unconfirmed','Fifteen-year-old Kassidy Edwards can&rsquo;t forget the horrific sound. &ldquo;It was just two big loud popping noises right after each other and there was nothing after that,&rdquo; she describes.

Kassidy and her mother say they discovered the dog hit by a car on their Leominster street early in one morning this spring and called police for help. They say the police responded right away and police began trying to find the dog&rsquo;s owner or a kennel or an animal control officer to come take the dog. Police say they did all they could, but because Leominster had no animal control officer, and no other neighboring community&rsquo;s officer could help, they shot and killed the dog. They say the dog was seriously injured and they called Fitchburg&rsquo;s Animal Control officer to take custody but they couldn&rsquo;t respond. They tried all of the local animal shelters and the dog was dying so they were advised as a last resort to shoot it. Kassidy says, &ldquo;It was sad, the dog got shot, they didn&rsquo;t know what else to do so they had to take the dog into the woods and shoot him.&rdquo;\r\nState officials say this never would have happened if Leominster had an animal control officer. The say the officer could have come to the scene and taken the dog away. MSPCA Chief Richard LeBlond says he was stunned to learn the City of Leominster would be without an animal control officer for a year. Chief LeBlond says, &ldquo;In this age it shouldn&rsquo;t be happening.&rdquo; We contacted city leaders for answers. Leominster Purchasing Agent Greg Chapdelaine says they had difficulty finding someone to fill the role, but after a year-long search, they hired an animal control officer that started August 1st. This comes as an effort to make these positions more professional and uniform from town to town is implemented. By law, all cities and towns must designate an animal control officer every year. The state recently strengthened its animal control Laws. Officers must have proper training, and state officials will be keeping a much closer eye on them. Chief LeBlond says the stakes are higher than people realize, explaining, &ldquo;All we have to do is lose a person&rsquo;s life and what&rsquo;s that worth.&rdquo; Kassidy hopes no one will have to go through what she did and hear the shooting of a dog.','http://boston.cbslocal.com/2013/08/05/leominster-police-shoot-dog-as-last-resort-because-of-no-animal-control-officer/','Unknown','Two Unknown Police','1','0',1,0,0,'3','3','Uniform','3','3','0','0','0','0'),(837,'2013-07-18','North Carolina','Winston-Salem','Winston-Salem Police Department',3,2,1,'Unconfirmed','A Winston-Salem police officer shot and killed a dog Thursday after it and two other dogs acted aggressively, police said.

She was taken by Willard EMS to Mercy Hospital where she was later released. The officer who fell also suffered injuries and was treated at Mercy Hospital. The Huron County Dog Warden&#039;s office arrived and captured one of the pit bulls, which was struck by a bullet. The dog warden took the animal to a veterinary clinic. It was later released. Kyle Zarcone, 19, and Anthony Hicks, 19, were both arrested on charges of drug possession, and Willard police seized evidence of drug trafficking and a safe. Additional charges may be filed after review by the law director. The Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation and Identification has been called in to conduct a review of the shooting.','http://www.sanduskyregister.com/article/2982581','Unknown','Unknown','1','2',2,0,1,'1','1','Not Sure','1','2','2','0','2','2'),(840,'2012-10-07','Nebraska','Omaha','Omaha Police Department',1,50,0,'Golden Retriever and Labrador mix','An Omaha police officer shot and killed a dog on a public sidewalk. The officer&rsquo;s report claims the shooting was justified; however, the owners call the incident an execution of a friendly, family pet. Mike McKnight obtained surveillance video of the incident for a Fact Finders exclusive. On October 7th, after midnight, police blocked a street in the area of 35th and Vinton to look for an armed suspect. They say Chris Schulte, who lives in the area, ignored orders to stop and walked the family dog toward the search area. He was arrested and his dog, Teela, shot. Chris Schulte said, &ldquo;You know I should have got back but I was just walking on. Not threatening, dog wasn&#039;t being aggressive.&rdquo; In the report by Officer Schuster and Officer Clement, the officers said &ldquo;suspect&rsquo;s dog became aggressive, growled at officers, and showed its teeth before being shot and killed.&rdquo; Tim Wagner told Channel 6 News he watched the incident, live, from inside his home via a night vision security camera. Wagner said, &ldquo;The dog didn&#039;t stand a chance. The dog did nothing aggressive. I&#039;ve lived next to this dog two and a half years and it&rsquo;s one of the best dogs.&rdquo; Fact Finders checked with the Nebraska Humane Society. Teela, a Labrador, golden retriever mix, had a clean record with no history of bites or vicious behavior. Schulte says Teela belonged to his aunt, Michelle Meadows. Meadows said, &ldquo;It was very shocking. I would think they would maybe taser her or something, if they thought she was being aggressive, but I don&#039;t think she was.&rdquo; The police report described Schulte as intoxicated. He was arrested, at the scene, for obstructing police and resisting arrest. He claims Teela, who was still on a leash, didn&rsquo;t threaten to attack officers before one of them shot her. &ldquo;They didn&#039;t have to shoot em. Not at all. (It was an) Execution,&rdquo; said Schulte. Fact Finders showed the video to Omaha police command staff, whom provided a response. Lt. Darci Tierney said, &ldquo;The Omaha Police Department is aware of the incident and Chief Schmaderer has authorized an Internal Investigation into the matter.

Serna and Morales said they went outside and the officer approached them saying there had been a 911 call about a deceased woman. Morales then said the officer told him he was responding to the call from another family blocks away on another street, who had once lived in their house. Morales said the officer then told him 20 minutes later to check on his dog. According to Morales, the officer said, &ldquo;He trotted up to me after I turned the corner, came to my feet and I shot him.&rdquo; Morales said the officer described how he told the pit bull to get back, and when he didn&rsquo;t, he stepped back and fired his service revolver. However, the officer admitted to Morales the pit bull never growled at him. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if he meant to go straight down between the eyes or the top of the head, but it went from the mouth down,&rdquo; Morales said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s heartbreaking. It&rsquo;s an innocent dog.

Someone had called 911 to say that mailboxes were being broken into.\r\nAs the officers were driving to the address on La Barbera Drive, Morales said they saw the suspects fleeing in a car. The officers tracked what they believed was that car to the 500 block of North 3rd Street in the Japantown neighborhood.

At Michael Dadio&rsquo;s house on George Street, his girlfriend&rsquo;s kids played in the back yard while his dad mowed the lawn. Then the cops showed up. They killed the family dog, tasered Michael Dadio Sr. and then arrested him &mdash; all because he didn&rsquo;t show up to court on DUI charges. (Dadio Sr. was not available for comment.) This overreaction by two East Haven police officers &mdash; in front of children &mdash; has upset neighbors on a street where many families own dogs. &ldquo;The way this happened was totally reckless,&rdquo; says Dadio Jr. He says he went to the police to complain and was told, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a dog.&rdquo; The shooting happened in May while the Department of Justice (DOJ) was investigating EHPD on complaints of racial profiling of Latinos. The DOJ&rsquo;s final report is expected sometime in July. The sergeant who killed the dog was the same one who signed off on the highly controversial arrest of a priest last year, which ignited national news coverage of complaints from area Latinos and the subsequent DOJ investigation. Dadio&rsquo;s story differs from the official police record. (The priest&rsquo;s account also differed from the police report in that 2009 case.) According to officer Jason Zullo&rsquo;s report, on May 22, he drove by the George Street home and &ldquo;immediately recognized Michael Dadio standing in front of his [son&rsquo;s] residence.&rdquo; Zullo knew Dadio had an arrest warrant for skipping court. (That&rsquo;s a misdemeanor. According to the state judicial website, Dadio has no convictions.) Sgt. John Miller and Zullo approached the house. &ldquo;Dadio immediately ran from officers in an attempt to elude capture when he saw the police vehicles arrive,&rdquo; according to the report. Zullo writes that Dadio ran to the back yard and Miller followed. Zullo went around the other side of the house. &ldquo;As officers gave chase, Sgt. Miller was confronted by an aggressive dog/pit bull forcing him to discharge his weapon,&rdquo; says the report. The report does not say that the dog chased, lunged at, intimidated or bit either of the officers. The back door to the house was wide open, says the report, and Dadio Sr. wasn&rsquo;t seen anywhere in the yard, so officers went inside to look for him and found him &ldquo;inside a cabinet under the kitchen sink.&rdquo; Then they tasered him after shouting at him to comply. Dadio says there&rsquo;s no way his dad would fit under the kitchen sink, and, there was no reason to taser him. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a harmless guy. My dad didn&rsquo;t even know there was a warrant for his arrest.&rdquo; Dadio admits that his dad ran from the cops. But that&rsquo;s because they got out of the police car with their guns drawn, he says. Dadio was outside next door and says he saw what happened. He says his dad went towards the back of the house, where the children were playing. The family&rsquo;s two dogs were barking, but are very well trained and both went through obedience school, he says. The German shepherd was on the back porch barking at the cops, when it was shot in front of the kids, who Dadio estimates were about 25 feet away. &ldquo;They could have killed the kids,&rdquo; says Dadio. After the shooting and the arrest, Dadio says more cops arrived. They blocked off the street and didn&rsquo;t let anyone enter the home for hours. Meanwhile, standing in the street, Dadio could hear his dog crying. He was so freaked out and upset, he says, that he left. The dog bled to death. The kids were so traumatized, says Dadio, that they wouldn&rsquo;t sleep at the house for days. Dadio is planning on filing a lawsuit. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not expecting any money, but I want something done to the officer. Suspend him or something.&rdquo; Neither Miller nor Zullo have been suspended, but an internal investigation is ongoing, says interim chief Gaetano Nappi. Several neighbors filed civilian complaints about the shooting, Nappi confirmed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d rather not harm anybody,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;If in fact [the shooting] was justifiable, it&rsquo;s an unfortunate circumstance of us doing our job.&rdquo;','http://www.informationliberation.com/?id=31241','Unknown','John Miller and Jason Zullo','1','0',1,0,0,'1','1','Uniform','1','2','0','0','2','0'),(845,'2009-03-12','Texas','Bruceville-Eddy','Bruceville-Eddy Police Department and McLennan County Sheriff&#039;s Office',1,2,1,'Unconfirmed','Family members were demanding answers Friday after officers killed a dog and then used a Taser to subdue the dog&rsquo;s elderly owner for refusing to obey a command to stop, only to learn afterward that the man was deaf and likely didn&rsquo;t hear the order.\r\nThe dog was one of two that chased a Bruceville-Eddy woman into her home and wouldn&rsquo;t let her come out late Thursday afternoon.

When Steurer arrived at the home in the 0-99 block of Churchill Court, he walked in through the garage and heard the cries, which led him upstairs. &quot;I turned and looked. There was a medium-size brown pit bull,&quot; he said. The dog&#039;s mouth was clamped on the 41-year-old woman&#039;s forearm. She &quot;was covered head to toe in smeared blood,&quot; Steurer said. The dog was &quot;actively chewing and pulling on her right arm. I was thinking, what am I going to do to get this dog off of her?&quot; Steurer said he grabbed the dog by its neck, which caused it to let go of the woman. &quot;He dug his feet in, turned his head &hellip; toward me and growled,&quot; Steurer said. Fearing another attack, Steurer said he decided to shoot the dog. At that point, other officers had arrived and tended to the woman, who was taken to Provena St. Joseph Hospital in Elgin and later transported to Advocate Lutheran General Hospital in Park Ridge. Officers also found the woman&#039;s 5-year-old nephew and 11-year-old niece in a bedroom. Steurer said the dog first attacked the boy and then turned on the woman after she intervened.

Scoppettuolo said the two large dogs were friendly during the first few moments when 14-year-old Brandon Marchetti was inside the construction yard. But that suddenly changed and the animals attacked Marchetti without warning, Scoppettuolo said. The 12-year-old dialed 911 on his cellphone and frantically summoned help. Moments later, Revere Police Officer Mike Mullen, along with other officers and Revere firefighters, arrived on the scene to see both dogs mauling Marchetti, according to Revere police. Mullen fired at both dogs, hitting one in the leg and driving it away from Marchetti, Detective Sergeant Steven Pisano of the Revere police said last week. Firefighters sprayed the other dog with a fire hose, cut open the gate, allowing Mullen to climb the fence and carry the boy to safety, Pisano said. Marchetti was transported by ambulance to Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, according to Scoppettuolo&rsquo;s uncle, Richie Troville, who said he did not know the boy&rsquo;s condition. A hospital spokeswoman could not confirm Saturday whether Marchetti was at the hospital. Marchetti&rsquo;s parents could not be reached for comment Saturday. Pisano said Scoppettuolo told police Marchetti had scaled the fence by climbing a snow bank and jumping onto a retaining wall connected to the fence. Scoppettuolo told officers he stayed on the wall while Marchetti jumped down into the yard. The owner of the property has kept guard dogs in the yard for three decades, and in all that time police never received a complaint about him or the dogs, Pisano said. The yard was enclosed by a padlocked, 6-foot-high, chain-link fence topped with barbed wire, he said. Mullen was uninjured, police said. In the phone interview Saturday, Scoppettuolo said he and Marchetti often visited the dogs, named Bella and Sonny, while on walks around their neighborhood. But neither had ever before tried to enter the construction yard near the Northgate Shopping Center. Troville said his nephew remains deeply upset by witnessing the dogs suddenly turn on his best friend. &ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s still kind of distraught,&rdquo; Troville said. Troville said Marchetti and Scoppettuolo spend a lot of time together, looking for things to do in the neighborhood. They would routinely visit the dogs, feeding and petting them through the fence, Troville said. According to Troville, the owner had warned the boys to be cautious near the animals. &ldquo;He told them you need to stay away from the dogs,&rdquo; Troville said of the owner of the construction yard.

She said it was a Chinese Shar-pei, a 60-pound dog that can be aggressive and is sometimes used for fighting. Sgt. Beaulieu said in the memo on the incident that at around 5 a.m., police got a call from a man at 28 Summer St. who said he was stuck in his car with his daughter and couldn&rsquo;t get out because a dog that he thought was a pit bull was trying to attack them. Officer Cerullo went to the scene and was able to distract the dog so that the man and his daughter could get out of their car and enter their home. He said that during that encounter, the dog charged him several times. Further, he said he was unable to locate the owner. About three hours later, around 8:15 a.m., Cerullo was called again to the same address because the dog was trying to attack another person, according to Beaulieu&rsquo;s memo. Animal Control Officer Bistany was notified, and Cerullo waited at the scene for her to arrive. He cleared a parking area of bystanders while also attempting to locate the dog&rsquo;s owner. Cerullo said that as he was watching the dog, it charged him several times, and at one point, got within a few feet of him. &ldquo;At this time, Off.

Police were called to the township village of Brownsville, located west of Shenandoah, shortly before 8 a.m. about two dogs fighting on a front porch at 1301 W. Penn St. When Patrolman Ray Tonkinson arrived, he found a pit bull aggressively attacking a chocolate Labrador-pit bull mix. Both dogs were of similar size. &ldquo;The pit bull was ripping the other dog apart when I got there,&rdquo; Tonkinson said. &ldquo;The pit bull had to be put down.&rdquo; The owners of both dogs are Christopher Brown and Annie Hornberger, who also own three other dogs at that address. Tonkinson said no people were attacked during the incident. After the attacking dog was killed, the surviving dog was taken by the state dog warden to the Ringtown Valley Veterinarian Hospital, where it is being treated. Brown and Hornberger spoke of the incident and are sad about the loss of their female pit bull named Princess and the injuries to the other female dog named Bella. Both were acquired as rescue dogs and were about 2 to 3 years old, spayed and microchipped. &ldquo;I was at work and my girlfriend left out one of the dogs (Lab),&rdquo; Brown said. &ldquo;The other dog got out of the cage and they got in at it. She couldn&rsquo;t separate them, so the police were called. The police shot the pit bull and the other dog is at the vet.&rdquo; As for the Labrador&rsquo;s condition, Brown said, &ldquo;Right now she&rsquo;s staying for observation, but she should be able to pull through. They have her intravenously taking fluids. There are a couple of stitches in the mouth.&rdquo; Hornberger said that all five dogs are taken well care of, though two dogs have medical conditions. &ldquo;All my dogs have had their shots, including for rabies, and they all have food,&rdquo; Hornberger said. &ldquo;Because one dog has a skin condition and another has colitis, there are some people who say my dogs have rabies. The dog warden saw the records for the shots and the licenses, and if I didn&rsquo;t have them, I would have been fined and my other dogs would have been taken away from me.&rdquo; Hornberger said that there wasn&rsquo;t much she could do in separating the dogs. &ldquo;There are neighbors here who wanted me to separate two pit bulls and keep three other dogs tame plus keep my five-year-old son away from the fight,&rdquo; Hornberger said. &ldquo;What am I going to do at 90 pounds against two dogs? I can only do so much, and I think I did what I could to protect my son and the other three dogs.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an animal lover, but I&rsquo;d rather see the animal get put down than have my stepson in the middle of it,&rdquo; Brown said. &ldquo;Maybe if I would had help during the first 20 minutes, I could have saved her (Princess),&rdquo; Hornberger said. &ldquo;It got started about 20 minutes after 7. When it got out of control, I just couldn&rsquo;t get her mouth open and get the other dog away. I was here screaming and crying for help.&rdquo; Hornberger usually lets each of the five dogs outside separately, but she said they all get along with each other. &ldquo;By the time I opened the front door, both of the dogs were out. Well, Bella jumps to play, so she started to play and the pit didn&rsquo;t know it,&rdquo; Hornberger said. &ldquo;I tried to calm them down. I feel terrible because I couldn&rsquo;t separate them.&rdquo; Hornberger was visibly upset in describing what happened and shed tears about the loss of Princess and the injuries to Bella. &ldquo;I wish I could have done more,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d do anything for any of my dogs, and it hurts to have to stand there and watch and not be able to help either one of them.&rdquo; &ldquo;There are no charges at this time,&rdquo; Tonkinson said. &ldquo;The dog warden will be reviewing the paperwork on the dogs.

Aldana lives with the owner of the dog, Daniel Shoaf, 28, who said he went to church Sunday morning and later dinner when the shooting happened. &quot;When I came home, everyone was like freaking out,&quot; Shoaf said. According to police, Officer Christopher Schoof pulled up to the home about 5:30 p.m. Sunday to serve an arrest warrant on a man, who based on information, might be at what the dispatcher called a &quot;party house.&quot; Police said Nero was tied to a cable in front of the home, but the dog&#039;s collar broke as it acted aggressively toward the officer. In his report, Schoof said the dog was growling and showing its teeth while charging at him. Schoof said he tried to retreat from the dog, but with, Nero continuing to come at him, he fired two shots. Aldana, who was sitting on the front porch beside Juanira Puentes, 22, said the first shot fired roughly 15 feet in front of them hit the dirt, but the second bullet struck Nero in the chest. &quot;It was crazy. I had never seen anything or anyone get shot. It was like in front of my face,&quot; Puentes said. Because Shoaf was not home, a neighbor drove Nero to the animal clinic at Purdue North Central near Westville where the dog died. Shoaf said an online petition asking for the officer to be terminated or resign has been signed by more than 500 people. Aldana wonders why the officer didn&#039;t use his Taser if he felt he was in danger and there were many people, including children, playing close to where the dog was shot. The officer had his gun pointed more toward the ground, but had any of the shots flown above of the dog someone on the porch could have been hit, Aldana said. &quot;He just didn&#039;t even think.

It happened last Wednesday in southeast Waxahachie when the animal suddenly appeared in a residential neighborhood.  Feathers on the ground are a mute reminder of where the bird met its end in Malcolm Brigman&rsquo;s yard. &ldquo;First thing I saw was that durn thing coming,&rdquo;  90-year-old Malcolm Brigman told CBS 11 News. He faced German soldiers in the Ardennes in World War II&mdash;and then a very tall challenge again last Wednesday in his own yard. &ldquo;It scared me, you know, when it come out,&rdquo; he said of the animal. Brigman was caught in the climax of a blocks-long chase of a stray emu. Fully grown emus can be 6-feet tall, weigh 150-pounds and run 55 miles an hour. &ldquo;These animals are extremely powerful,&rdquo; animal control officer Warren Howell told CBS 11 News. Howell, who had handled emus in the early 1990s,  had the animal under control once by sneaking up behind it. &ldquo;You always want to approach them from the rear. Because emus have hinged knees that lift up to the front they cannot strike hard to the rear.&rdquo; But he couldn&rsquo;t get it into his truck&rsquo;s dog-sized cage. &ldquo;It had different ideas about going into the truck. I lost my grip on it when it pushed off the tailgate.&rdquo; Howell and six other police and animal control officers tried herding and corralling it again when Brigman suddenly entered a danger zone. &ldquo;He stepped out of the shed directly in the path of the emu and there was nobody between him and the emu,&rdquo; Howell recalled. &quot;He &lsquo;rassled him and threw him down, but he couldn&rsquo;t hold him,&rdquo; Brigman said of Howell and the emu adding, &ldquo;And it kicked him upside the head, I think, and down his eye. And his stomach, arms.&rdquo; Howell picked up the story. &ldquo;There are 6-inch talons that come out the end of those feet and if those get into you they can cause serious damage,&rdquo; he said. He knew he and a fellow animal control officer were losing their battle to sit on and tie down the emu. Brigman feels Howell and the others had to act. &ldquo;And he knew that bird was fixing to get up from there, so he just stood there and told the police, &lsquo;Shoot him, shoot him.&#039;&rdquo; Police fired twice at Howell&rsquo;s instructions. &ldquo;The Waxahachie police officer needed to fire two shots to field euthanize the animal.&rdquo; Howell insists the choice  was either the emu or Brigman. &ldquo;Yes.

She has not yet heard a response, but the issue is expected to be addressed Wednesday during the Atwater City Council meeting when, ironically, Berger said he intends to present a proposed ordinance to allow chickens in the city, that the council asked him to prepare earlier this year.\r\nThe situation started this spring when Turnball&rsquo;s five-year-old son, Phoenix, was given baby chickens and ducks as a birthday gift. &ldquo;He takes care of them,&rdquo; said Turnbull. &ldquo;He plays with them.&rdquo; Turnbull said she wasn&rsquo;t aware at the time the city didn&rsquo;t allow poultry. In May, another Atwater family who also had chickens, asked the city council to change the ordinance. City Clerk Goldie Smith said she was in the process of researching chicken ordinances when Turnbull&rsquo;s neighbor, Dick Rierson, brought pictures of Turnbull&rsquo;s muddy poultry pen to the August city council meeting.\r\nSmith said the council decided at that point to inform Turnbull, and other residents who had chickens, to remove them. In an interview with the West Central Tribune, Rierson said he was concerned about having chickens in town living &ldquo;in filth like that&rdquo; and that he feared it would attract rats. Rierson said the chickens &ldquo;were probably nice pets, but you have to keep it clean.&rdquo; He seemed surprised to learn that the police chief had killed one of the chickens. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not for mistreating any animal,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not for killing a chicken for the sake of killing a chicken.&rdquo;\r\nBut Rierson said the ordinance prohibiting livestock was put in place for a reason and if killing the chicken was the only way for the police chief to address the problem, &ldquo;then I&rsquo;d say he&rsquo;s doing his job.&rdquo; Berger said when he got the call on Aug. 16, he saw the chicken in a yard next to Turnbull&rsquo;s house. He said he tried for 10-15 minutes to catch the chicken or chase it back into the pen. &ldquo;I feel like I made a good effort to get it back in,&rdquo; he said. But when the other two chickens and two ducks in the fenced pen started to get out, Berger said he closed the door that he&rsquo;d opened, grabbed a shovel leaning against Turnbull&rsquo;s garage and &ldquo;dispatched&rdquo; the chicken. Since there were children playing in the adjacent yard, Berger said he didn&rsquo;t want to use his gun to kill the chicken and the shovel was the &ldquo;safest way to dispatch it.&rdquo; When asked why it was necessary to kill the young chicken instead of letting it be, Berger said the family was &ldquo;not supposed to have them in the first place&rdquo; and that he wanted to give the aggrieved neighbor &ldquo;some results.&rdquo; It was the same process he would use if there was a report of a skunk, he said. &ldquo;I guess I don&rsquo;t regret it, because it&rsquo;s like taking care of any rodent in town,&rdquo; he said. Turnbull said she doesn&rsquo;t understand that logic. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t perceive a chicken being a threat to anybody,&rdquo; said Turnbull. Turnbull&rsquo;s neighbor, Jason Shoutz, said he saw Berger walked up to the chicken by the coop and swing the shovel &ldquo;up and down.&rdquo; His young daughter was in the yard at the time and saw the officer kill the chicken. Berger said he left no note on the door and although he intended to initiate contact the family after killing the chicken, he did not. Shoutz informed Turnbull and her fianc&eacute;, Chris Gordon, about what happened. Gordon said he called the police chief later that day. &ldquo;I said, so you came to our home and killed our chicken with our shovel?&rdquo; said Gordon, retelling the  conversation. &ldquo;He said, &lsquo;Yup. Any questions?&rsquo; That&rsquo;s the thing that makes me mad.&rdquo; The situation has been the talk of the town for a while, but Berger said &ldquo;most of the people think it&rsquo;s rather silly.&rdquo; When asked what was silly, he responded, &ldquo;That there&rsquo;s such uproar about a chicken.&rdquo; Berger said that after advising city council members what had happened, he was instructed not to take immediate action regarding Turnbull&rsquo;s remaining poultry. Turnbull is upset with the police chief but she also blames herself for not taking the city&rsquo;s initial warning seriously. She said she discounted the verbal warning, in part because she never received anything in writing about removing the animals and because of the upcoming vote on the ordinance. She said it didn&rsquo;t make sense to move the animals to a farm for a couple weeks with the possibility they could eventually be legal in town. Berger said he believes the other families who had poultry in town removed their animals after being instructed to do so. Atwater Mayor Mark Olson declined to comment for the story. He said both sides of the issue, which he called the &ldquo;chicken fiasco&rdquo;, would be discussed at the council meeting this Wednesday. Turnbull said she intends to be at that meeting and is still hoping the council agrees to adopt an ordinance so her son can keep his remaining chickens and ducks.','http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/weird/2014/09/02/officer-decapitates-pet-chicken/14979133/','Unknown','Police Chief Trevor Berger','0','0',1,0,0,'0','2','Not Sure','0','3','0','0','0','0'),(870,'2012-07-31','California','Colton','Colton Police Department, San Bernardino Sheriffs Department',1,2,0,'Unconfirmed','On July 31, 2012, the Los Angeles stations didn&rsquo;t have their choppers flying anywhere near enough to San Bernardino County to catch the police pursuit that began in Colton. If they had, there&rsquo;s a strong chance they&rsquo;d have caught another chase that ended badly, this time for 21-year-old Trevor Michael Taylor. Colton Police Sgt. Steve Davis was running a regular patrol when he spotted a green Honda Civic just before 11:15am, near the intersection of 9th and H streets. Knowing that Civics get stolen quite a bit in California and just about everywhere else, Davis radioed dispatchers to see if the car was stolen. The Civic came back stolen, the day before from Rancho Cucamonga, according to a report released by the San Bernardino County District Attorney&rsquo;s Office. Davis called for backup as he continued to trail the car. Two officers&mdash;Sgt. Lou Gamache and Officer Todd Smith&mdash;fell in behind Davis, following the Civic as it traveled on Auto Plaza Way, over the 215 Freeway into San Bernardino. Davis tried to pull the car over as it reached E Street, heading east. That&rsquo;s when the pursuit began. The officers chased the car for 21 minutes, according to the prosecutors&rsquo; report. The driver of the Civic pushed the small car as fast as 80 mph down city surface streets. Prosecutors allege the car almost struck an elderly, cane-wielding pedestrian. Davis tried to use a PIT maneuver four times to stop the Civic, to no avail. He lost control of his patrol car after the fourth try, with Smith taking over the lead role in the chase. As the Civic sped south on San Francisco Street, Smith tried a PIT maneuver, this time with success. The Civic spun around and the officers boxed it in with their patrol cars. Gamache saw straight into the Civic&rsquo;s driver&rsquo;s side window as it aligned with his own and he got a look at the driver for the first time&mdash;it was Taylor. Smith got out of his patrol car and approached the Civic with his gun drawn. He ordered Taylor take his foot off the gas and keep his hands in plain sight. Gamache, still looking at Taylor through his open window, also had his gun trained on the man. Gamache told investigators that he saw Taylor mouth, &ldquo;OK,&rdquo; as he held his hands in the air. Suddenly, Taylor dropped his hands and quickly leaned forward. Gamache thought Taylor was going for a gun. So did Smith. Both officers fired a barrage of shots at almost the same time, according to prosecutors. Taylor slumped over in his seat, dead. A search of the Civic revealed he had no weapon. Instead, officers found a large dog in the car. The animal sustained a gunshot wound to the paw. As is common for many police departments, Colton elected to have the county sheriff&rsquo;s department investigate the officer-involved shooting as a homicide, to avoid any possible accusations of conflicts of interest. Detective Mauricio Hurtado handled the investigation for the San Bernardino County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department. Hurtado took statements from at least three witnesses, none of whom felt the officers used unnecessary force in shooting Taylor. One witness told Hurtado that she felt the officers gave Taylor every opportunity to surrender without being shot. An autopsy report showed that Taylor was struck by 13 bullets fired from two different guns. Many of them struck him in the head and chest. Toxicology reports showed he had amphetamine and methamphetamine in his system when he died. The District Attorney&rsquo;s Office cleared Gamache and Smith of any wrongdoing, saying both officers acted in self-defense. A year after the shooting, Taylors parents brought a Federal lawsuit against the police officers involved, the police chief, and the city. Taylor et al, v City of Colton Case Number 5&#58;13&#45;cv&#45;01330&#45;PSG&#45;AJW.

After 11 years, Bonnie Boudreaux never expected to lose her guard dog, Paddy, like this: Shot and killed in her front yard. &quot;We were thick as thieves, the two of us. He was my buddy,&quot; said Boudreaux. It all happened Sunday morning, Boudreaux says she heard gunshots nearby, somewhere on her 32 acres of land, and called 9-1-1. &quot;I said, well you don&#039;t need to come to my house because I have a dog that&#039;s protective and won&#039;t let you get out of your car,&quot; said Boudreaux. Boudreaux wanted deputies to search the property, not her home. But not getting that message, a deputy came to her house, and got out of his car, despite the signs in the driveway. &quot;I went out there and I said back up and get into your car. Get back in your car,&quot; said Boudreaux. But it was too late.... &quot;I was headed in his direction when he shot the dog. Had I been two, or three, steps closer I would have gotten it too.

Gutierrez forced the Barboza family to tie their labrador mix Bobby to a pole in their front yard. Gutierrez then proceeded to shoot Bobby three times with a rifle retrieved from his squad car. Gutierrez killed the dog in front of the Barboza&#039;s three year old daughter, as well as several children who looked on from their school bus stop directly in front of the Barboza family home. Gutierrez justified the killing based on three complaints filed by a neighbor of the Barbozas in five days, who police describe as &quot;mentally disabled.&quot; The neighbor&#039;s first two reports allege that Bobby broke into the neighbor&#039;s home and &quot;ripped a shirt&quot;. The neighbor stated that she knew it was the labrador despite the fact she had not witnessed any such events. When police failed to act based on the neighbor&#039;s outlandish claims, she escalated - instead of saying the Bobby had ripped a shirt, the third complaint alleged that Bobby was in fact a &quot;vicious pit bull&quot; that &quot;went after&quot; her daughter. 45 minutes after receiving this last fanciful allegation, Gutierrez was killing Bobby in front of a pack of children. Two weeks after the shooting, the Barboza family has filed a quarter million dollar lawsuit and Gutierrez is suspended from the police force. Here is how Jackson Hole News &amp; Guide reports the events:  Bobby, the dog shot three times 14 days ago by a Teton County, Idaho, Sheriff&#039;s Deputy and the center of a lawsuit, is currently at the veterinarian and may undergo surgery today. &quot;We hope the vet will be able to sew up his wounds,&quot; said Joshua A. Garner, attorney for the dog&#039;s owner, the Barboza family of Felt, Idaho.\r\nThe shooting, which drew national and regional attention, occurred when deputy Joseph W. Gutierrez responded to a call from a neighbor accusing the 5-year-old mutt of vicious behavior Nov. 12. The Barboza family alleges that Gutierrez arrived with the express purpose of killing their dog. Gutierrez has been suspended, pending a completed investigation. The Barbozas filed a civil tort claim for $250,000, the cap for non-economic damages, against Teton County on Nov. 21. &quot;The Deputy&#039;s actions were cruel, inhumane, outrageous and unlawful,&quot; the claim says. &quot;More than anything, we are looking for accountability as well as an apology from the sheriff&#039;s office,&quot; Garner said. In a press release, the sheriff&#039;s office justified Gutierrez&#039;s actions according to a county ordinance that says if a vicious animal cannot be safely impounded, then it may be destroyed. The press release referenced details from several reports made by a neighbor who alleged misbehavior and attacks by the dog.\r\nThe release also labeled Bobby a dangerous breed that the Barbozas failed to register and restrain within their yard. &quot;This is an unfortunate event which has occurred. Teton County Sheriff&#039;s Office is considering it a learning experience that we can learn from and improved policy and procedures in deal [sic] vicious animals,&quot; the release says. The attorney for the Barboza family disagreed. &quot;They are trying to spin this and make it look like the dog owner&#039;s fault,&quot; Garner said, &quot;when in reality you have a deputy who shot this dog three times without proof and no warrant.&quot; The release, issued Monday, said the shooting was in accordance with Section 8 and 11.4 of the Teton County Ordinances. According to the release, Section 8 says &quot;that if any vicious animal so found at large cannot be safely taken up and impounded, such dog may be destroyed by the Animal Care and Control Officer or Teton County Sheriff&#039;s Office.&quot; The release&#039;s reasoning included references to the dog as a pitbull - a breed deemed too dangerous to be accepted by the Idaho Humane Society - and previous allegations of aggression, all made by a neighbor. It also highlighted the Barboza family&#039;s response to the shooting. Garner was outraged by the statement. &quot;I don&#039;t think the Teton County Sheriff&#039;s Office is taking this seriously,&quot; he said. The Teton County Sheriff&#039;s Office logged three incident reports all made by the same neighbor against Bobby within five days. The sheriff&#039;s office press release described the neighbor as &quot;mentally disabled.&quot; The first, filed Nov. 8, reported: &quot;neighbor&#039;s dog ripped shirt.&quot; Deputy Tim Scheer arrived in Felt at 3:52 p.m. and left at 4:09 p.m. Two days later, the same resident filed a claim that she returned home to find a ripped shirt. &quot;The dog next door did it,&quot; the report reads, &quot;[the reporting party] did not witness this.&quot; The shooting occurred Nov. 12. The report, filed at 2:55 p.m., details that a &quot;vicious pit bull went after [reporting party&#039;s] daughter.&quot; The daughter made it inside, unharmed. Gutierrez was dispatched at 3 p.m. and arrived on the scene at 3:38 p.m. Ten minutes later, he logged: &quot;Shots fired. Dog is dead.&quot; He cleared the scene at 4:07 p.m. The tort claim offers the following account of events from Leo Barboza&#039;s point of view: Gutierrez demanded to see Bobby, saying he was there to kill him and did not need to provide proof that the dog had bitten or attacked anyone. He instructed Barboza to bring Bobby outside and tie him to a pole, while he retrieved his rifle from his vehicle. Barboza pleaded for his dog&#039;s life. Gutierrez fired three shots, one through the dog&#039;s neck and two in his head. Barboza&#039;s father-in-law, wife and 3-year-old son witnessed the event. According to reports, a school bus unloaded a group of children moments before the shooting. They all stood on the street and witnessed it. Barboza moved Bobby to the dog&#039;s usual hideout under the trailer, Garner said. The Nov. 12 incident report continued with three entries the following night, when Barboza&#039;s father-in-law suffered an anxiety attack, deemed stress-induced by his doctor. An ambulance was called, with a request made for a reporting officer other than Gutierrez. The family returned  Nov. 14 to find Bobby alive. The sheriff&#039;s office press release highlights the Barbozas&#039; delayed treatment of their dog as negligent. Cooke declined to discuss details of the incident because it was under investigation, but he echoed the press release by saying that the county must learn from the shooting. &quot;The problem is going to continue to grow,&quot; he said, &quot;the county is going to have to step up and make some changes.&quot; Among the reforms, he said, they will examine deputies&#039; training on handling aggressive animals. The sheriff&#039;s office recruited Gutierrez from out-of-state for his bilingual skills less than a year ago, prior to his certification, said Teton County Sheriff Kim Cooke. Cooke said Gutierrez had just returned from Peace Officer Standards and Training as a Detention Officer in Boise, Idaho. Cooke said Gutierrez had been a Marine. Gutierrez has been suspended following the shooting, the second recent suspension of a Teton County deputy. There are currently six active deputies. &quot;It puts us down a bit,&quot; Cooke said. &quot;We need more help.&quot; He said the high cost of living made recruitment and retention of deputies difficult in Teton County.\r\nThe Teton County Sheriff&#039;s Office has received multiple threats following the incident. KIDK, a CBS affiliate in Idaho Falls, Idaho, broke the story with video of Bobby&#039;s gaping wounds Nov. 20, igniting public indignation nationwide. Reports ran on CNN and The Drudge Report, among other media sources. &quot;There&#039;s so many people who think they know the story,&quot; Cooke said. &quot;It&#039;s pretty easy to make a decision when you don&#039;t have to make them.&quot;','http://www.jhnewsandguide.com/archives/idaho-dog-survives-shots-fired-by-sheriff-s-deputy/article_e4962057-9c41-55eb-aac8-42ce400d1f01.html','Bobby','Joseph W.

When asked why he shot the helpless puppy, the shooter replied: &ldquo;Yeah, I shot the dog. What the fuck you gonna do about it?&rdquo; The cop&#039;s question was answered recently with two lawsuits against the city of Harvey and its police in relation to the incident. Here is how the events were reported: The city of Harvey is currently facing two lawsuits from a December incident in which officers shot a man in the leg without cause, shot and killed a witness&rsquo;s puppy, and threatened a witness. Harvey, a far south suburb of Chicago, has a median income and home value of about half the statewide median. The population is 90 percent black and Latino. Paul Manning claims officers in a squad car followed him as he walked down a street on December 30. As described in the lawsuit, the officers stopped their car and told Manning to &ldquo;come here&rdquo;; Manning, however, who was unarmed and had done nothing wrong, kept walking. As he kept walking away from the squad car, Manning slipped and fell. When he tried to get up, one of the officers shot Manning in the back of the leg. After Manning fell yet again, the officers fired still more shots at him. While Manning was lying on the ground, one of the officers stood on the man&rsquo;s back and handcuffed him. A nearby witness tried to record the incident on his cell phone. The officer, however, grabbed the witness&rsquo;s cell phone and threw it while, as Manning describes in the lawsuit, saying, &ldquo;You touch the phone, I will shoot the shit out of you.&rdquo; Meanwhile, Karnischa Miller heard gunshots and opened the back door to witness, as she claims, &ldquo;a young man, Paul Manning, lying on the ground after having been shot. He was screaming and asking for an ambulance.&rdquo; Her 14-week puppy Nemo ran out through the open door. An officer yelled to Miller&rsquo;s boyfriend to come get the dog, but as LeShon Wright advanced to follow the order, an officer raised his gun towards Wright and the dog. Wright stopped in his tracks, but the dog kept walking towards the officer. Although Nemo &ldquo;did not growl, bark, or act aggressively in any way&rdquo;, the officer shot the puppy. The city of Harvey has admitted that the officers shot Miller&rsquo;s dog. Miller claims that the officer&rsquo;s response was, &ldquo;Yeah, I shot the dog. What the fuck you gonna do about it?&rdquo; Miller claims that she and her children were so disturbed by Nemo&rsquo;s brutal murder, and from &ldquo;being forced to helplessly watch him die&rdquo;, that they moved from Harvey to Wisconsin. She is now suing the city of Harvey, Officer James Sinnot, and Officer Davres on the grounds of excessive force, illegal seizure, failure to intervene, and emotional distress. Manning, who has sued the city of Harvey, Officer Sinnot, and Officer O&rsquo;Shea, is seeking punitive damages for excessive force, battery, and emotional distress.','http://www.opposingviews.com/i/society/harvey-ill-police-shoot-unarmed-man-threaten-shoot-shit-out-witness','Nemo','James Sinnot, Davres and O&rsquo;Shea','2','0',1,0,1,'2','2','Uniform','0','0','2','0','1','0'),(883,'2012-09-02','New York','New York','NYPD',1,1,0,'Parakeet','A situation propagated by NYPD police escalated to violent levels for Evelyn Lugo&#039;s family on September 2, 2012 - an event that is now the center of a lawsuit in Brooklyn Federal Court. Ortega et al v. City of New York et al Case Number 1:2013cv06646 Filed November 29, 2013 New York Eastern District Court. Evelyn is pictured above. Despite the focus of the title, this unnecessary event is all around tragic for its violence and destruction towards an innocent family. The Staten Island mom of 10 recounts the Labor Day barbecue gathering among some of her grown children. Lugo&#039;s son Edwin Avellanet, age 26, was taking garbage out when cops did a &#039;stop-and-question&#039; about an orange cone nearby to reserve a parking spot for family members. They demanded to see identification and he refused saying he had done nothing wrong. A cop grabbed him by the arm but he retracted his arm and went into the house. City cops busted several windows. When Lugo opened the door to see what was happening, cops barged into her home, busting the door - no warrant of course - and beat up her family and their friends, using batons on the victims&#039; faces. Grandchildren were among the victims traumatized by the pepper spray used in the St. George home. A daughter allegedly had an asthma attack from the plume. The pet parakeet was ejected from its cage after commotion from the cops knocked it off a dresser. Lugo&#039;s daughter, Anna Febles, says she screamed &quot;The bird!&quot; when the officer said &quot;F--- the bird&quot; and stepped on it, killing it. Lugo says: &quot;They threw me like a piece of garbage on the floor.&quot; Backup cops arrived to barge in and look for Avellanet. As per the usual MO, the victims were arrested and initially faced criminal charges. Then those charges were dropped but there has been no retribution for the family, nor disciplinary action towards the cops involved. Evelyn reports being sick, depressed and heartbroken since the incident. Their attorney, Jason Leventhal, helping them in the suit alleging unlawful search and seizure, excessive force and malicious prosecution, said: &quot;It was completely uncalled for.&quot; Evelyn pulls it all into perspective when she says: &quot;They [the police] don&rsquo;t care about us as humans, they&rsquo;re going to care about the bird?&quot;','http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nypd-killed-parakeet-staten-island-mom-article-1.1541112','Tito','Charles Drobness, Ralph Conde, Thomas Nigro, Mary Gillespie and Unknown Police','0','0',1,0,2,'1','1','Uniform','0','0','2','2','1','2'),(884,'2013-09-27','Tennessee','Mountain City','Mountain City Police Force',1,1,0,'Squirrel','It sounds nuts, but a Tennessee police officer has been kicked off the force after a run-in with a squirrel. Jody Putnam was fired from the Mountain City Police Force after a Sept. 27 incident where he shot his gun at the unnamed squirrel, which had found its way into the Dollar General store. Animal control was called to help get rid of the rascally rodent, but when that officer was unavailable, Putnam answered the call of duty instead. Putnam tried to apprehend his squirrelly suspect by shooting his gun inside the store, according to property owner Carl Duffield.\r\n&quot;Shooting back there, of course that should not have been, that should not have happened. Then they began to spray it with mace and pepper spray.&quot; Duffield told WJHL-TV. &quot;There was a lot of people that come out and just like me they came out and they were coughing and a hacking. It was comical, but I&#039;m sure they didn&#039;t feel that way, the customers that came out.&quot; It is unknown how many shots Putnam fired, and Dollar General store officials have refused to release the surveillance tape. When bystanders were allowed back in the store, they saw the dead squirrel pinned under his shoe, the Mountain City Tomahawk reported. In Mountain City, officers are required to make a written statement to their supervisor whenever they fire a weapon.\r\nPutnam, an officer with nearly two decades of experience, refused to explain his squirrel shooting, so he was fired by the town&#039;s Board of Mayor and Alderman, according to WBIR. &quot;The decision the City Council made on this incident speaks for itself,&rdquo; Mountain City Mayor Lawrence Keeble told the Tomahawk. A year after the incident, not only has Jody Putnam not suffered any criminal penalties for recklessly endangering a store full of people, he had the audacity to run for Johnson County Sheriff in the August 7th, 2014 elections.

Its relationship to reality is dubious: On April 25th just before midnight, two South Precinct bicycle officers were contacting several people in an alley behind a tavern (4900 Block Rainier Ave. South) when an intoxicated male approached them and began interferring with their investigation. At one point the suspect grabbed one of the officer&rsquo;s bike in an attempt to distract them. When the officer responded toward the suspect, who is described as 6&rsquo;06&Prime;, 300 pounds, took up a fighting stance and said, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s fight!&rdquo;  Officers immediately ordered the suspect to the ground. He refused, and thrust his hands into his pockets. The officer then attempted to use pepper spray on the suspect and take him into custody. The suspect was able to shake off the officer and run up a flight of stairs into an apartment.  The officers requested additional officers respond to the scene. At that point, the officers were still out with the four individuals in the alley. They made the decision to release those individuals and began to move toward the stairs. At that point, the suspect began throwing metal items at them from above, nearly striking the officers and people below.  The officers approached the suspect&rsquo;s apartment to where they could hear a dog barking/growling on the other side of the door. The officers announced their presence and told the suspect to secure his dog. The suspect then sent the dog into the hallway at the officers. The dog subsequently retreated back into the apartment and the officers told the suspect to secure the dog yet again. At that point the officers heard the suspect tell the dog to &ldquo;get &lsquo;em!&rdquo; and the dog charged them.  One of the officers was not able to retreat any further due to the size of the landing.  When the dog got close enough to bite him, the officer had no other option but to fire two shots at the dog, killing it. The officers then ordered the suspect onto the ground. The suspect refused and was tased by one of the officers. The suspect was then taken into custody. The suspect was later taken to Harborview Medical Center for evaluation due to his intoxication. The 42 year old suspect will be booked later into the King County Jail for Investigation of Assault and Investigation of Harassment.

Metro spokesman Officer Marcus Martin said the chimp that was killed was shot by an officer after it appeared the chimp was headed toward residents, including children, who had come outside to watch the chase. A 911 call at 10:13 a.m. alerted officers to the escaped chimpanzees near Ann Road and Jones Boulevard. Live-streamed video of the ensuing chase showed multiple Metro Police and animal control units involved in the hunt for the chimps, each of which weighed upwards of 170 pounds. The chimpanzees, one male and one female, had escaped from a residence on the 5700 block of Rowland Avenue, Martin said. Neighbors said the chimpanzees appeared agitated and felt they were going to be attacked. One of the chimpanzees climbed on top of a woman&rsquo;s car and tried to open her door. At one point, one of the chimps had climbed onto a police car and was banging on it, Martin said. When one chimpanzee &mdash; the male &mdash; was about to enter a neighborhood area where neighbors and children were outside, it was shot and killed by one of the officers. The other chimpanzee was continuing on Rowland Avenue, where it was tranquilized shortly before 11:45 a.m. &ldquo;When you see the size of these animals, we think reasonable people would understand (to stay away),&rdquo; said Martin. The owners of the chimpanzees, David and Sheri Potochan, had been approved by the county for keeping exotic animals, Clark County spokesman Dan Kulin said. Martin said the female chimp had been returned to its owners. Metro Police public information officer Bill Cassell said reinforcements were made to the chimp&rsquo;s holding area before its return.

With the chimp squealing in the background, Herold cries out, &quot;He&#039;s killed my friend!&quot; The victim, Charla Nash, 55, remains hospitalized with life-threatening injuries after the chimp, once featured in television commercials for Coca-Cola and Old Navy, attacked her Monday afternoon, police said. Nash had just arrived at Herold&#039;s house when Travis jumped on her and began biting and mauling her, causing serious injuries to her face, neck and hands, according to Stamford Police Capt. Rich Conklin. Conklin said the attack was unprovoked, but he described it as &quot;brutal and lengthy.&quot; Herold had called Nash to her house to help get 14-year-old Travis back inside after he used a key to escape. While her friend was being attacked, Herold was unable to pull the primate off. She then called 911 before stabbing the chimp with a butcher knife and hitting him with a shovel. Neither fazed Travis, who police said had been like a child to Herold. A Stamford police officer later shot the chimp multiple times after the primate went after him inside a police cruiser, Conklin said. Travis returned to the house, where police found him dead. Conklin estimated that Travis weighed close to 200 pounds. Conklin couldn&#039;t confirm media reports that the chimp had Lyme disease, though he did say investigators were taking their time with the case to determine what may have provoked Travis to attack Nash. Animals often do not exhibit symptoms of Lyme disease, caused by the bite of certain types of ticks, although aggression is a possible symptom, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Conklin said Nash had recently gotten a haircut that changed her appearance significantly. Conklin said the chimp had been acting &quot;rambunctious&quot; earlier, prompting Herold to put Xanax in a cup of tea for him to drink. He did not know if the animal had been prescribed the medicine or if Herold had ever given her pet such a mixture before. Conklin added that his department is not used to dealing with cases such as this, and they were trying to familiarize themselves with laws and regulations before deciding if charges will be filed. Conklin said this isn&#039;t the first interaction his officers have had with Travis. The chimp, who was well known and liked in the community, escaped in 2003 and &quot;wreaked havoc&quot; on the streets of Stamford for a couple of hours, Conklin said. Travis&#039; body was removed from the home and taken to two locations: His head was taken to the state lab for a rabies test and the body was taken to the University of Connecticut for an animal autopsy. Conklin said this is standard procedure. The chimp, who was known to walk around town, sometimes without a leash, also liked to surf on the Internet and was able to change the TV channel with a remote, according to a Stamford Advocate article. The paper also reported that Travis watered plants, was able to feed hay to his owner&#039;s horses, ate at a table with the rest of the family and sometimes drank wine from a stemmed glass. Charla Nash has since sued twice - the first lawsuit against the estate of Sandra Herold, the now-deceased former owner of Travis the chimp. Nash&#039;s second lawsuit was against the city of Stamford Connecticut, and alleged that the Department of Environmental protection neglected its duties by granting Herold an exotic animal license for Travis, allowing him to be kept in the home. This latter suit sought $150 million dollars in damages. In 2013, the courts dismissed Nash&#039;s suit against the city. Her legal team pressed on, seeking help from the state Judiciary Committee. May of 2014 the Committee voted against granting Nash relief, preventing her from moving forward with her latter lawsuit. Connecticut grants itself sovereign immunity in almost all torts, forcing those who wish to sue the state to request permission from the state to do so, in the form of the state claims commissioner. As one might expect, claims against the state are few and far between as a result.','http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1880229,00.html','Travis','Frank Chiafari','1','0',0,1,0,'0','2','Uniform','1','1','0','0','1','0'),(895,'2014-05-02','Montana','Chillicothe','Chillicothe Police Department',1,1,0,'capuchin monkey','Friday night there was peace and calm in Chillicothe after an escaped monkey eluded police for hours and had neighbors scrambling for cover. The monkey was shot and killed by authorities in the city located in Livingston County, about 97 miles northeast of Kansas City. Police said they ran out of tranquilizer darts and had no choice but to use deadly force because they believed it would have been a threat to others. Chopper 5 was rolling when the creature was spotted running on the property of M&amp;L Trucking and Repair about 4 p.m. The monkey was running full speed and then stopped and collapsed. Later someone placed a blanket over it. The white-headed capuchin monkey escaped from Johnston Rental Center about 8:30 a.m. The creature got out of its cage and escaped through a vent. Police say the owner, Bill Johnston, is a licensed breeder by the United States Department of Agriculture and has about 30 of them, but the one that escaped Friday couldn&#039;t be contained. It had been sighted all around the city of 10,000 people, but mostly in the southern or southeast part of the city. &quot;We seen a bunch of cops, happened to look over and seen this monkey running through the yard and it took off running and the cops took off after it,&quot; William Johnson said. &quot;I think it was more scared than anything with everybody chasing it, but it was a fast little monkey,&quot; Nicole Irving said. Fast, free and elusive. These neighbors said the primate spent part of the day hiding in a garage on Herriford and Violet streets, directly across from the Garrison Elementary School which had to go on lockdown. &quot;We had preschoolers here at the building. We kept them safe. We did stay inside on this nice day, but everybody was kept safe,&quot; said teacher Kari Keller.\r\nJust before 4 p.m. there was another sighting at a metal shop, just a few blocks away, near International Road and McCormick Street. Attempts to sedate the money failed after the owner ran out of darts.

Police evacuated an estimated 300 people from the zoo compound Thursday and killed Jabari, a 13-year-old male western lowland gorilla, after he charged at officers. Zoo workers armed with tranquilizer guns had pursued the animal through the forested jungles of the Wilds of Africa exhibit for about 40 minutes, but could not gain a clear shot, officials said.\r\n&ldquo;It tried to charge two of our officers, so we had to shoot it,&rdquo; Deputy Police Chief Daniel Garcia said. &ldquo;You can imagine the pandemonium we had out here when he got loose. We felt terrible we had to put this animal down.&rdquo; The injured included a mother and her toddler son. Rivers Noah, 3, was in fair condition at Children&rsquo;s Medical Center with multiple bites to his head and chest. His mother, Keisha Heard, 26, who was bitten on the legs, and Cheryl Reichert, who suffered arm injuries, were treated at hospitals and released. &ldquo;I was like, &rsquo;This is not happening, this is so unreal,&rsquo; cause he just came out of nowhere,&rdquo; Heard said Friday on NBC&rsquo;s Today show. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m watching this gorilla. He has my son in his mouth, he&rsquo;s attacking him, and I tried to help him and there wasn&rsquo;t really anything that I could do. ... He slings me back across the concrete area where we are. So it was really scary.&rdquo; The fourth injured person, a child, was treated at the scene. Jabari was in the award-winning gorilla-conservation area, two acres surrounded by a 16-foot concave wall, before the attack around 5 p.m. Some youths had reportedly teased Jabari shortly before.\r\n&ldquo;He had to have scaled the wall,&rdquo; said zoo director Rich Buickerood. But &ldquo;this habitat is among the best in the country. This blows our minds.&rdquo; He said he did not know why zoo employees, who were armed with pepper spray, did not use it on the gorilla. Some zoo-goers hid inside a restaurant and the monorail surrounding the Wilds of Africa exhibit. The gorilla darted in and out of thick bamboo and trees before officers spotted him on a nature trail. He was holding a pair of white children&rsquo;s sandals when he came within 15 feet of two officers who shot him, police Lt. Anthony Williams said. The 114-year-old zoo has been in financial straits and the nonprofit Dallas Zoological Society recently proposed a county takeover. Buickerood said last month that the zoo staff had been cut and maintenance postponed because of the fund shortage.','http://www.nbcnews.com/id/4558461/ns/us_news/t/gorillas-escape-violent-rampage-stun-zoo-officials/#.VBsJtvldXGA','Jabari','Two Unknown Police','2','0',1,1,0,'0','2','Uniform','1','1','0','0','0','0'),(898,'2008-03-12','Texas','Bastrop','University of Texas at Houston Police Department',1,100,0,'Chimpanzee','An 18-year-old research chimpanzee was shot and killed after he escaped from an enclosure at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center facility in Bastrop.

They used &quot;at least one tranquilizer dart&quot; before a 5-year-veteran of the police department fatally shot the animal, said assistant Police Chief Thomas Engells with the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. It was the second time in five months that a chimp has escaped from the Michale E. Keeling Center for Comparative Medicine and Research.

Boise police say the 75-pound dog ran aggressively toward officers as they walked up to Lortz&rsquo;s trailer home on Patricia Lane. One officer fired five shots. Three bullets hit Lortz&rsquo;s Subaru, flattening both tires on the passenger side and hitting a door handle, he said. &ldquo;They shot my dog and killed my car,&rdquo; said Lortz, who described the dog as a 5-year-old Australian Bandog. The incident began about 10:15 a.m. Sunday when a neighbor called police, saying it sounded like a fight was going on and someone may be hurt. Lortz said his wife was having a panic attack related to her medication, had been crying out in the yard and then came back inside. Accounts from Lortz and the police differ, principally about whether the gate leading to Lortz&rsquo;s yard was open or shut when police arrived. Lortz said his wife had just been next to the gate and was sure it was closed. Officers reported it was open and the dog ran through it before they reached the gate. Lortz, who was inside the trailer, didn&rsquo;t see what happened but &ldquo;heard gunshots go off in my driveway and my dog screaming.&rdquo; From what police told him and evidence at the scene, he said he believes one officer opened the gate and startled Scrappy Doo, which in turn startled the officer, who ran toward the back of the Subaru. &ldquo;When he ran, the dog gave barking chase, his partner saw it and opened fire,&rdquo; Lortz said. Here&rsquo;s what Boise police say: Officers arrived, parked nearby and heard yelling inside the trailer as they walked toward it, police spokeswoman Lynn Hightower said. The Subaru was parked close to the gate, and as officers walked along the Subaru&rsquo;s passenger side, a large dog ran out of the yard. &ldquo;The officers described the dog as growling and baring its teeth ... charging toward them and within just a couple feet of them both,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Both officers felt the dog was attacking them and about to bite them. Both pulled their firearms to defend themselves. &ldquo;One officer began to run and turned away,&rdquo; she said, adding that the officer has trained with the BPD&rsquo;s canine unit, including wearing a &ldquo;bite suit&rdquo; for training, and &ldquo;knows when a dog is about to bite.&rdquo; &ldquo;The second officer, also just feet away and seeing the threat to both himself and the other officer, immediately fired at the dog.&rdquo; Police reported that the dog was shot twice, and Lortz said that&rsquo;s what he initially thought. But, he said, it now appears one bullet struck a bell on the gate, knocking it into the dog&rsquo;s neck and causing a 2-inch cut. &ldquo;He was saved by the bell,&rdquo; Lortz said. &ldquo;There was blood on the bell.&rdquo; Police gave Lortz a restitution form to fill out, and Lortz said his initial impression is that he will likely be reimbursed for damage to the car but not for the veterinarian bills, which run about $400 so far. Hightower said no such determination has been made, and the city&rsquo;s insurer will decide which damages will be covered. Lortz said Scrappy Doo still has a bullet near his ribcage but is recovering well and in good spirits, something he called &ldquo;miraculous.&rdquo; He said he doesn&rsquo;t blame the officers. &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t come here to kill my dog. They thought my wife was in danger,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The officer who shot my dog did it to save his partner&rsquo;s life.

Owner Gabrielle Stropkai said she had let the dog out to use the bathroom as she sat outside her apartment with neighbors. Stropkai said the dog had become more wary of strangers since giving birth two weeks ago. &ldquo;She barks at people she really doesn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Stropkai said. Police claim that Kita charged toward the officers, snarling and acting aggressively. One officer shot the animal in the back of the head when she was less than 3 feet away. Stropkai contested the police account. She said Kita was walking back toward the entrance of Stropkai&rsquo;s ground-level apartment when she began to bark at the officers, but did not charge or act aggressively toward them. The officer asked Stropkai and her friends to whom the dog belonged. Then, according to Stropkai, he immediately pulled his weapon and fired, killing the dog in front of her 2-year-old son. Stropkai and her neighbors tried to staunch the bleeding, but it was too late. Kita never made it to the vet. &ldquo;I ran towards her and grabbed her face, but you could already tell,&rdquo; Stropkai said. &ldquo;I felt her take her last breath, and she was dead.&rdquo; Police spokesman Charles McClure said the officer was within his rights to use lethal force to protect himself if he felt the dog was somehow a threat to him. &ldquo;As with every citizen, a person has a right to defend themselves,&rdquo; he said. The pet was running loose in front of the apartment, a violation of the city ordinance that requires dogs to be leashed, he said. Stropkai was not cited. McClure said there&rsquo;s no indication the shooting was inappropriate, and he noted that independent witnesses to the shooting said they saw the dog acting aggressively. Stropkai said Kita had never bit anyone and was not a threat to the officer. Stropkai said she had the dog since it was 5 weeks old, and Kita had always displayed an even temperament. Stropkai also said that if Kita had been charging, she would have been shot in the face or chest. Instead, the bullet entered the back of the dog&rsquo;s head and exited through her stomach. An investigation into the shooting is ongoing, McClure said. Officials plan to conduct a review of the use of force policy, as is typical in this type of incident, he said. McClure said there&rsquo;s no estimated date for the investigation to be completed. Neighbor Kenny Taylor was outside with Stropkai when the shooting occurred. He said Kita began to bark after the officer asked about the dog&rsquo;s owner. &ldquo;I was already headed down the sidewalk, and boom,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There was no time to get the dog, nothing.&rdquo; On Monday morning, Stropkai&rsquo;s 2-year-old son rode his bicycle around the small parking lot in front of the apartments, circling past the spot where Kita&rsquo;s bloodstains were still visible on the pavement. Inside, six puppies slept together in a crate. Stropkai said she has to bottle-feed them every few hours. All of the puppies have been claimed, she said, but they are too young to go to their new homes. For now, Stropkai and her friends are just trying to keep the 2-week-old dogs alive and healthy. Pete Ritter, Boise&#039;s deputy police chief, called Kita&rsquo;s death &ldquo;unfortunate.&rdquo; &ldquo;Officers never want to harm an animal,&rdquo; he said in a statement. &ldquo;The dog came upon the officers quickly and they felt it was about to bite them. This is a very dog-friendly community. Many officers have dogs. We work with dogs. Dogs running loose are a safety risk, for people and for the dogs. This was a very unfortunate situation for everyone involved.&rdquo; Stropkai asked why the officer, if he truly felt threatened, didn&rsquo;t deploy a Taser or pepper spray rather than lethal force. &ldquo;You could have kicked my dog away from you and she would still be here,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;She could have a broken rib or something, and I would take care of her, but she would still be here.

Police were called to the home to check on the welfare of two children, Deputy Chief Craig Kingsbury said at a press conference Wednesday. Upon knocking on the slightly-ajar door, two dogs attacked one of the officers.\r\nThe videos shows the officer firing his weapon three times at close range, severely injuring the dog, Junior. Police transported the animal to a veterinary hospital, but the dog died en route. Larry Carver, brother-in-law of the dog&rsquo;s owner Anthony O&rsquo;Hare, said the first gunshot hit Junior in the leg, dropping him to the ground.\r\nTwo more shots were fired, one in the dog&rsquo;s stomach, which killed him. The Idaho Press-Tribune requested comment from O&rsquo;Hare, but did not receive a reply Wednesday evening. &ldquo;I can tell you he&rsquo;s not heartless,&rdquo; Kingsbury said of the officer who shot the dog. &ldquo;This bothered him, and it bothered several other members of this agency. A lot of us are dog lovers.&rdquo; The second dog fled when the shots were fired, Sgt. Tim Randall said. Officers don&rsquo;t know if it has since returned to the home. A dog was barking inside the residence Wednesday evening when the Press-Tribune spoke with Carver. The welfare check was otherwise routine, Kingsbury said, and the caller&rsquo;s concerns, when investigated, were unfounded. Carver, who ran outside just after shots were fired, believes the situation could have been handled differently. He questioned why the police didn&rsquo;t use the &ldquo;mace&rdquo; they had on them on the dog instead. &ldquo;I just didn&rsquo;t understand that and they were here to do a welfare check, and they&rsquo;re firing guns,&rdquo; Carver said. Pepper spray from the belt of the officer who shot the dog was punctured by apparent bite marks. Randall said that while it&rsquo;s acceptable to have dogs for protection, it&rsquo;s important to understand the liability that goes along with it. &ldquo;They need to be careful to make sure that the dog doesn&rsquo;t come into contact with the wrong person,&rdquo; Randall said. &ldquo;Whether that&rsquo;s keeping the door locked, or a good fenced yard, a secure yard that&rsquo;s well-signed.&rdquo; The two videos were taken by the officers&rsquo; CopVu cameras, small devices that clip to their uniforms shirts and are activated with a simple slide motion.

The incident happened at Branger&#039;s home Saturday after he says he thought the dog was going to kill his chickens. &quot;I asked him if he actually saw her attack the chickens and he said, &#039;no, but I don&#039;t know what she did when I went in the house to get the gun&#039;,&quot; Geary said. &quot;He shot her when she was walking away...shot in the back.&quot; Officer Brangers declined to talk on camera, but did say he&#039;s remorseful for what happened, and in the future plans to better enclose his chickens. He says the past year, neighborhood dogs have killed 15 of his 19 chickens and that he&#039;s shot at five dogs. He says he&#039;ll shoot again if animals threaten them. Geary says Brangers shot and killed those five dogs. Geary reported his incident to authorities. As far as the Scott County Sheriff&#039;s Office is concerned, the case is closed. The KRS says that given the fact the shooter, in this case the Lexington police officer, had the right to shoot to protect his chickens. &quot;The most disturbing thing I heard him say was that he is going to eliminate the threat before it becomes a threat,&quot; Geary said.\r\nThe Scott County Attorney&#039;s Office is now reviewing the case to see if any laws were broken.

Its of interest that Striker was the first casualty of Ruby Ridge. The following excerpt is from Wikipedia, reproduced 9-18-2014 at 2:19 PM EST: Operation &quot;Northern Exposure&quot; was suspended for three months due to the confirmation hearings for USMS Director Henry E. Hudson.The Weavers noticed the lack of USMS activity and began to believe the USMS had dropped the case. On August 21, 1992, six marshals were sent to scout the area to determine suitable places away from the cabin to ambush and arrest Weaver. The marshals, dressed in camouflage, were equipped with night-vision goggles and M16 rifles. DUSMs Art Roderick, Larry Cooper and Bill Degan formed the reconnaissance (Recon) team, while DUSMs David Hunt, Joseph Thomas and Frank Norris formed an observation post (OP) team on the ridge north of the cabin. At one point, Roderick threw two rocks at the Weaver cabin to test the reaction of the dogs. The dogs became alerted, and Weaver&#039;s friend Kevin Harris, and Weaver&#039;s 14 year old son, Samuel, emerged and followed the dog Striker to investigate. Harris and the younger Weaver were hoping that the dog had noticed a game animal since the cabin was out of meat. Sammy Weaver told his father he believed the dogs had sensed either a large animal or a man in the woods. The Recon team marshals (Roderick, Cooper and Degan) initially retreated through the woods in radio contact with the OP team, but later took up hidden defensive positions. Later the OP team marshals and the Weavers both claimed the Weaver dogs were alerted to the Recon team marshals in the woods after neighbors at the foot of the mountain started their pickup truck. The Recon team marshals retreated through the woods to the &quot;Y&quot; juncture in the trails 500 yards west of the cabin, out of sight of the cabin. Sammy and Harris followed the dog Striker on foot through the woods while Randy also on foot took a separate logging trail. Vicki, Sara, Rachel, and baby Elisheba remained at the cabin, at first appearing anxious to the OP team, but later appearing relaxed. Randy encountered the marshals at the &quot;Y&quot;; Roderick claimed to have yelled, &quot;Back off! U.S. Marshal!&quot; upon sighting Weaver, and Cooper said he had shouted, &quot;Stop! U.S. Marshal!&quot; Later statements by Roderick, Cooper and Randy agreed that Randy responded by cursing and retreating from the marshals. About a minute later the dog and the boys came out of the woods and a firefight erupted between the marshals and Sammy and Harris.\r\nAccounts differ at this point as to who first opened fire but agree that DUSM Roderick shot and killed Weaver&#039;s dog and that Samuel Weaver returned fire at Roderick. After the Federal agents began firing, 14 year old Samuel Weaver was shot in the back while retreating, and DUSM Degan was shot and killed by Harris.\r\nThe version of the firefight told by DUSMs Roderick and Cooper was that the dog, followed by Harris then Sammy, came out of the woods. DUSM Degan challenged Harris, who turned and shot Degan dead without Degan firing a single shot. Roderick then shot the dog once, Sammy fired at Roderick twice, and Roderick fired once again. Roderick and Cooper heard multiple gunshots from the Weaver party. Cooper fired two three-shot bursts at Harris and Cooper saw Harris fall &quot;like a sack of potatoes&quot;. An impact caused leaves to fly up in front of Cooper who then sought cover. Cooper saw Sammy run away. Cooper radioed to OP team Dave Hunt that he had wounded or killed Harris.\r\nHarris&#039; version was that, when the dog followed by Sammy then Harris came out of the woods, the dog ran up to Cooper and danced about as he did in playing with the children. The dog then ran to Roderick, who shot the dog in front of Sammy, who cursed Roderick and shot at him. Degan came out of the woods firing his M16 and hit Sammy in the arm. Harris then fired and hit Degan in the chest knocking him down. Cooper fired at Harris who ducked for cover. Cooper fired again and Sammy was hit in the back and fell. Harris fired about 6 feet in front of Cooper and forced him to take cover. Cooper announced that he was a US Marshal. Harris checked Sammy&#039;s body, found him dead, and ran to the cabin.','http://mag.newsweek.com/1995/08/27/the-echoes-of-ruby-ridge.html','Striker','US Marshalls Art Roderick, Larry Cooper, Bill Degan, Lon Horiuchi, David Hunt, Joseph Thomas, Frank Norris et al','1','0',1,0,1,'1','1','Uniform','1','2','1','0','1','1'),(905,'2013-05-27','Idaho','Idaho Falls','Idaho Falls Police Department',1,50,0,'American Bulldog mix','Idaho Falls police shot and killed a dog Monday night while they were serving a warrant.

Jeff Blitz, who let his dog Ace out early Thursday morning, detailed the moment he heard gun shots while sitting inside his garage. &ldquo;They shot the dog and then came to the garage. The dog came around to me and he (the trooper) said &lsquo;you better calm down,&rsquo;&rdquo; Blitz told ABC 27. &ldquo;I said, &lsquo;calm down? You just killed my dog.&rsquo;&rdquo; Blitz&rsquo;s neighbor, William Maynes, who heard the entire altercation from his home across the street, gave even greater insight into the trooper&rsquo;s actions. &ldquo;There was a lady running down the road saying &lsquo;don&rsquo;t shoot the dog, don&rsquo;t shoot the dog,&rsquo;&rdquo; Maynes recalled. &ldquo;&hellip; So I got up, looked out the window and all the sudden I heard bang, bang, bang&hellip;&rdquo; According to police, several local and federal law enforcement agencies were attempting to issue an arrest warrant for Blitz&rsquo;s daughter when the dog was shot. When researching for the arrest, the agencies failed to discover that Blitz&rsquo;s daughter had long since moved from the residence. Even worse, Blitz&rsquo;s 5-year-old grandson Dane was only feet away inside his room as the trooper wildly shot twice into the lawn before hitting the dog. &ldquo;They walked away when I pointed it out, I said &lsquo;you already took one part of my family and there&rsquo;s a second one in there watching TV,&rsquo;&rdquo; Blitz said. &ldquo;He could of got it too.&rdquo; Despite Ace being shot in the side, which leads Blitz to believe his dog was not being a threat to officers, Pennsylvania State Police spokesperson Rob Hicks defended the shooting, arguing that the offending trooper was likely keeping people safe. &ldquo;Every once in a while we get thrown into a situation where we have to protect either ourselves or somebody else and this is one of those situations,&rdquo; Hicks said. Blitz says the hardest part has been explaining the situation to his grandson, who watched Ace get buried in the backyard as police stood around in the front. &ldquo;He was just out there sitting talking to him a while ago,&rdquo; Blitz explained. &ldquo;He asked me, &lsquo;Pappy, can I go talk to Ace?.&rsquo;&rdquo; Although an investigation has been opened into the matter, few expect the trooper to be held accountable for shooting a dog outside the wrong home. &ldquo;The investigation is going to look at the whole picture, but the biggest point of the investigation is to be looking at whether the use of force was warranted in this situation,&rdquo; Hicks added.','http://www.abc27.com/story/25416604/trooper-shoots-kills-york-county-mans-dog','Ace','Unknown','2','0',1,0,0,'0','2','Uniform','0','2','0','0','2','0'),(909,'2013-09-01','Utah','Saint George','Saint George Police Department and Washington County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office',1,2,1,'Unconfirmed','A police shooting of a dog named Loki last Sunday remains under investigation by both the St. George Police Department and the Washington County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office. The St. George Animal Shelter and family have addressed placement of excess dogs that had been kept in addition to Loki at the owners&rsquo; home. In addition, Best Friends Animal Society has stepped in to accept Loki and tend to his medical needs and care. The history of the family involved, their dogs and neighbors reveals a pattern of similar incidents, including dogs biting people, dogs allowed to roam free of constraint and an excessive number of dogs maintained at their residences. While not all neighbors agree, neighbor concerns and complaints over the family&rsquo;s dogs, both at this residence and previous ones is not new. A St. George Police officer responded to the neighborhood of 1500 West and 1400 North last Sunday, when dogs were reported running loose and causing concern to neighbors. The officer observed four dogs and shot at one of them three times when the dog aggressively charged him, according to police statements. Resident Sherrill Brinkerhoff, who said she owns Loki, has lived at 1563 West 1400 North in the neighborhood for 13 years.  It is a a quaint, but by no means quiet neighborhood, in St. George. She is not the only dog owner there. Three &ldquo;Beware of Dog&rdquo; signs can be seen hanging on fences around yards throughout the neighborhood and dogs can be heard barking from inside neighboring homes and backyards. Brinkerhoff&rsquo;s residence is home to extended family from time to time as well as many dogs. A U-haul trailer was still attached to a truck parked in front of Brinkerhoff&rsquo;s house, Wednesday, evidencing the move her son Kolten Winder had just made to come live with her. Winder had arrived the  day before with his fianc&eacute; Chelsea Chiacchiera, two children and a dog, Dexter. The City of St. George has a two-dog limit on residences and includes provision for dog owners to apply for a kennel license if they wish to maintain more than two dogs at a given residence. This family of dog owners tends to watch each other&rsquo;s dogs and considers them all one in the family, Chiacchiera said, accounting for some confusion in who owns what dog. As of Sunday, there were eight dogs at the house. None of the dogs are licensed with the City of St. George. This is not a new or isolated incident with this family. City Attorney Shawn Guzman said that citations have previously been issued for too many dogs in that home. According to a statement issued earlier this week, neighbors told police that the dogs have acted aggressively towards them in the past. Records kept by the City of St. George include multiple criminal citations against members of this family. Between 1999 and 2006, Brinkerhoff, then named Winder, was cited five times for animal-at-large / attack / cruelty, and four times for two license violations each, at various other addresses. In 2007, Chiacchiera was cited at a different address when Angela Billmire was bitten by Chiacchier&rsquo;s pit bull on the upper left leg, on the back side by her butt. According to the incident report, &ldquo;The owner of the dog Chelsea stated the dog was getting aggressive and had bitten two other people the previous week. She turned the dog over to animal control.&rdquo; In June 2012, Brinkerhoff&rsquo;s dog, Sebastian (identified as Sabastain in the police report), bit neighbor Jim Brey on the back of his calf one night while Brey was on the sidewalk in front of her home. The dog was quarantined because animal control found Brinkerhoff&rsquo;s yard not secure enough to ensure home quarantine. Winder and  his family told St. George News about Sebastian. They said he was vicious and they had to put him down.\r\nIn October 2012, neighbors Shanna and Kyle Crosby complained about the dogs at the current Brinkerhoff home. According to the incident report, the Crosbys said: &ldquo;As people started walking close to the residence the dogs would start barking and run out into the street after the people.&rdquo; On investigation, officers identified one each of the following breeds at the home: sheltie, hound mix, black lab, German short hair mix, little mix-breed, and an extremely large pit bull / mastiff mix. There were also two puppies in the residence. A door was accidentally left open due to the move, Chiacchiera said. She said she had been sleeping and Loki and Dexter let themselves out and began wandering the yard and the street area in front of the home. St. George Police said there were four dogs loose when they arrived. &ldquo;I woke up to three gun shots,&rdquo; Chiacchiera said, consistent with the police statement that three shots were fired when the dog charged the officer. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think the cop should have shot the dog,&rdquo; neighbor Irma Gonzalez said. &ldquo;What I saw was the cop near the truck and the dog was far away. Three shots is excessive.&rdquo; &ldquo;I went into our kitchen, and there was blood everywhere,&rdquo; Chiacchiera said. She walked into Brinkerhoff&rsquo;s bedroom and found Loki bleeding and immediately rushed him to a veterinary clinic; the City of St. George paid the bill, she said. Neighbor Irma Gonzalez said the dogs have never been aggressive with her or her own dogs. She said she questions why police responded to an animal control issue and fears how this was handled and is keeping a watchful eye on her own pets. The officer used a hand gun in self defense, St. George Police Sgt. Sam Despain said; &ldquo;the officer was protecting himself at that point, the outcome was what it was, he really was just protecting himself.&rdquo; Chiacchiera did not witness the shooting and has only heard secondhand stories from neighbors. But she said one story she was told was that an elderly couple was taking a walk Sunday morning, when they saw her dogs they crossed the street as a precaution and called the police because the dogs seemed unattended and are widely known as an aggressive breed. Loki, the dog involved in the current shooting incident, is a 15-pound, medium-size blue heeler/pit bull mix, a &ldquo;friendly and curious dog,&rdquo; Chiacchiera said, as the family gathered around three of their other dogs Wednesday.NOTE: The weight claimed here along with the combination of breed claimed makes no sense, particularly when considered along with pictures of Loki. The breed and weight remain unconfirmed until issued by Best Friends Animal Society. While his daughter, Jasmine, kissed their pit bull Dexter, egging him on for a friendly wrestling match in the front yard on Wednesday, Winder watched. He wouldn&rsquo;t have vicious animals around his 9-month-old baby and his 5-year-old daughter, he said, and related the story of Sebastian who the family previously owned and had to put down because he was vicious. On Wednesday, Chiacchiera said that Loki was in critical condition and still needed surgery for a wounded front right paw and rear left paw. He was hit by three bullets, one of which grazed his lip after going through his nose, she said. The family needed to come up with $2,000 for the dog or decide to have him euthanized (no requirement to euthanize the dog has been imposed by authorities) and the family was seeking donations to cover the surgery. St. George Animal Shelter&rsquo;s manager, St. George Police Sgt. Ivor Fuller, said Loki was not in critical condition and had not been sedated. He had been given pain pills to keep him comfortable. &ldquo;The injuries were to his legs,&rdquo; Fuller said, &ldquo;he had casts on and was able to move around and did not act like he was in any pain at all.&rdquo; (NOTE-Since Fuller is a police officer, he has every reason to downplay the extent of Loki&#039;s injuries. Fullers credibility is additionally compromised when we consider that as soon as St George handed custody of the dog to Best Friends Animal Society, they rushed him into surgery.) Loki has since been taken into the care of Best Friends Animal Society.&ldquo;The owners released the animal to us, and we released the animal to Best Friends, who now has custody of Loki and is taking care of all his medical needs and they will place him in their facility,&rdquo; Fuller said. Today, Loki is in Las Vegas in surgery, Best Friends Media Representative Barbara Williamson said. &ldquo;We did accept the dog,&rdquo; Williamson said, &ldquo;and as part of the dog being accepted to Best Friends we agreed that he will not be adopted into St George or Washington County.&rdquo; She said such stipulations are not unusual. Brinkerhoff has yet to be charged with anything. Chiaccheria has been charged with failure to control a vicious animal, dog at large and failure to license.','http://www.stgeorgeutah.com/news/archive/2013/09/06/sai-officer-involved-dog-shooting-family-patterns-best-friends-steps-in-for-loki/#.VBs7rPldXGA','Loki','Unknown','0','1',1,0,0,'1','1','Uniform','0','1','2','0','2','0'),(910,'2011-03-21','Utah','Santaquin','Utah County Sheriff&#039;s Office and Orem Police Department',1,2,0,'Unconfirmed','Josh Boren, the police officer who shot and killed his wife, two young children and mother-in-law before taking his own life, was once disciplined for shooting at a stray dog while he was on duty rather than taking it to the shelter. According to a report obtained by the Deseret News through a public records request, Boren was suspended without pay for 36 hours in 2011 while he was working for the Utah County Sheriff&#039;s Office. On March 21, 2011, Boren called his supervisor to report that he was &quot;in trouble.&quot; He had picked up stray dog that appeared to be abandoned, took it to a remote area of Keigly Quarry near Santaquin, and fired at least three rounds at the dog with a .22 rifle in an attempt to kill the animal, the report states. It was unknown if any of the rounds actually hit the dog. However, one of the rounds did strike the passenger door of his patrol car, according to the report. Boren &mdash; who once worked as an animal control officer &mdash; later admitted he did not follow the department&#039;s protocols. &quot;Instead of booking the dog into the South County Animal Shelter in accordance with policy, you attempted to destroy the animal on your own,&quot; the report states. &quot;Although Orem Police Department did not find enough evidence to support criminal charges, your misconduct rises to the level of a serious behavior problem as defined (by the department&#039;s code book),&quot; the report states. &quot;Your misconduct has caused serious discredit to your credibility as a peace officer and to the Utah County Sheriff&#039;s Office.&quot; Boren, 34, graduated from Peace Officer Standards and Training in 2006. He worked at the Utah County Jail and as an animal control officer during his time with the sheriff&#039;s office. Boren had taken a job last fall as an officer with the Lindon Police Department. He was selected from a field of 70 candidates. His 2011 suspension was the only disciplinary action taken against him from either department. After Boren failed to report to work on Jan. 16, he and his family &mdash; wife Kelly Boren, 32; children Joshua &ldquo;Jaden&rdquo; Boren, 7, and Haley Boren, 5; and mother-in-law Marie King, 55 &mdash; were found dead inside their home at 37 N. 630 West in Spanish Fork. Friends and police say Josh and Kelly Boren had been having marital problems and were living apart. Kelly Boren was reportedly ready to begin divorce proceedings, according to some friends. A single funeral service was held Wednesday in Layton for Kelly, Jaden and Haley Boren and Marie King. A funeral service for Josh Boren was held in Spanish Fork on Thursday. Many of Josh Boren&#039;s friends and co-workers described him as a big teddy bear whom they wouldn&#039;t expect to lash out with such violence. But RiRi Whiting, one of Kelly Boren&#039;s best friends, believes there was more happening with her friend&#039;s marriage than what appeared on the surface. Just hours before her body was found, Whiting said she texted Kelly Boren who was headed home after work. In their exchange of text messages, Kelly seemed to indicate she was done with the marriage, Whiting said. She then used the word &quot;rage&quot; when referring to her estranged husband.','http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865594756/Officer-who-killed-family-was-once-disciplined-for-shooting-at-dog-report-says.html?pg=all','Unknown','Josh Boren','0','2',0,0,0,'3','3','Uniform','3','3','1','0','0','0'),(911,'2014-07-23','Utah','Ogden','Ogden Police Department',1,50,1,'Pit Bull 11yo','A family is outraged after Ogden police shot their dog in its own yard early Wednesday morning. Police say the dog was ordered to attack them and was shot in self-defense. However, the dog&rsquo;s owners dispute police&rsquo;s claims that the dog was aggressive and that there was no reason to put it down. A woman called police earlier to conduct a welfare check on her brother whom she hadn&#039;t heard from in three days, Lt. Tim Scott said. She was worried that he may be in danger of gang violence. At about 1 a.m. Wednesday two officers responded to the address on the 2900 block of Monroe Boulevard, Scott said. The officers rattled a chain-link fence around the home to check for a dog, but got no response, he said. The fence has a No Trespassing sign and Beware of Dog sign attached to it. They knocked on the door several times to make contact with the subject of the welfare check before they saw the man come from the back of the home with a baseball bat. Officers attempted to explain the situation to the man, who refused to cooperate and shouted expletives at them, Scott said. The man told officers that he would sic his dog on them, at which point he brought out a pit bull from behind the home. Officers say the man commanded the dog to &ldquo;get him,&rdquo; prompting the dog to move toward police in an aggressive manner. The officer closest to the pit bull drew his gun and fired at the dog, killing it in self-defense, Scott said. Mia Mendiola said the house that police responded to is her parents&rsquo; home. The parents are the dog&rsquo;s owners. &quot;Chuva wasn&rsquo;t just our dog, she was family,&ldquo; Mendiola said. The 11-year-old pit bull was given to her mother as a Mother&rsquo;s Day gift, and has since been a very gentle dog, Mendiola said. Mendiola, who lives next door to her parents, said she was awakened by multiple gunshots outside. She went outside and saw her mother, 58-year-old Barbara Sustaipa, in a panic after seeing her dog dead. \r\nSustaipa had to be taken to the hospital and was found to have suffered a heart attack, Mendiola said. The man police were there to see was Mendiola&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s boyfriend, Victor Rosa, she said. She said she doubts police officers&rsquo; account that he was threatening them with a baseball bat and the dog. No arrests were made at the scene. However, the Weber County Attorney&rsquo;s Office is screening charges against the man for assault on police, Scott said. With family members outside and upset, the officers opted not to make an arrest and left the scene to deescalate the situation, although the officers had enough probable cause to arrest Rosa, Scott said. Police said the man has a prior criminal history including simple assault, assault against a police officer and protective order violations. Scott said an internal investigation into the officers&rsquo; actions is being conducted alongside the criminal investigation into Rosa. Ogden Animal Services said they have had multiple calls of animal abuse at that home, but have never been able to make contact with the owners or the dog. Mendiola said Chuva was very loved among the family and that she has never been vicious. &quot;They could have done a lot of things differently,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There was absolutely no reason for her to die.&rdquo; Scott said the officers did not want to shoot the animal, but when faced with an attacking dog, police protocol calls for them to put the dog down quickly. The dog&rsquo;s remains are with Animal Services and will likely be returned to the owners.','http://www.standard.net/Police/2014/07/23/Utah-family-outraged-by-police-shooting-pit-bull.html','Chuva','Two Unknown Police','1','0',0,0,1,'0','0','Uniform','0','1','0','0','2','0'),(912,'2010-07-01','Florida','Orlando','Orange County Sheriff&#039;s Office SWAT',1,2,0,'Unconfirmed','Orange County, Fla. sheriff&#039;s officers forced their way in to a home, killed the pet dog as it hid in a closet and shot a teenage girl without justification, apparently while looking for someone else, the family claims in court.

They claim a sheriff&#039;s SWAT team kicked in their door, shot their dog to death and shot Seda three times in the legs. She was 17. Cruz rented the home and shared it with Seda and her dog. The sheriff&#039;s office obtained a warrant to search the property in July 2010 on the basis of probable cause based on previous police encounters with a Christopher Seda, the complaint states. &quot;Upon entering the premises, a member of the Orange County SWAT team shot Plaintiff Jennifer Seda three times in the legs and threw her face down on the ground,&quot; according to the lawsuit. &quot;A member of the SWAT team then restrained plaintiff Jennifer Seda and forced his knee into her back and began hitting her and telling her to be quiet.&quot; The women say the officers shot the dog to death although the animal showed no aggression against them and was actually hiding in the closet. Seda was unarmed and weighed about 100 pounds. &quot;The Orange County SWAT team detained plaintiff Jennifer Seda in her own home, where she was held against her will, interrogated, and denied medical treatment for approximately four to five hours,&quot; the lawsuit states.

They seeks damages for negligence, property damage, excessive force, battery, assault, false imprisonment and violation of Florida&#039;s Knock and Announce law.

Alice Renee McGlone says her cats Rhett Butler and Tara will have to go on without Scarlett &ndash;&ndash; her 9-year-old Labrador retriever &ndash;&ndash; after a York County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office deputy shot and killed the dog when, he says, it charged him aggressively on Tuesday. McGlone&rsquo;s friend Ron Montana buried Scarlett on Wednesday afternoon in her backyard, under a tree, on Clara Street in Rock Hill. Montana and McGlone say they&rsquo;re outraged that the deputy used lethal force. But, sheriff&rsquo;s officials say the deputy had no choice but to protect himself from the dog.\r\n&ldquo;He hated to have done what he did but we teach our officers that they need to protect themselves in all situations,&rdquo; said Capt. Allen Brandon. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s regrettable what happened.&rdquo; Scarlett was a friendly dog and warmed to strangers easily, McGlone said. After adopting the dog from a shelter at six weeks old, she and Scarlett were &ldquo;inseparable.&rdquo; On Wednesday, Scarlett&rsquo;s body was covered by a teal blanket in McGlone&rsquo;s yard. Before Montana buried the dog, McGlone knelt beside Scarlett and held her paw. Montana and McGlone say they don&rsquo;t understand how a deputy felt so threatened by Scarlett that he shot her. On Tuesday, two deputies went to McGlone&rsquo;s house just before 4 p.m. after McGlone&rsquo;s daughter called police to say she hadn&rsquo;t heard from her mother since Feb. 26. McGlone had been sick, she explained, and her phone was dead on Sunday night when her daughter in Virginia tried to call. When deputies arrived for a routine welfare check, no one was home. There were no cars in the driveway and deputies noticed a broken window screen, pulled away from a window on the side of McGlone&rsquo;s house. They tried knocking on McGlone&rsquo;s front door first but got no response, according to a sheriff&rsquo;s office report. As one deputy, Jonathan Reed, knocked on a window at the rear of McGlone&rsquo;s house, he saw her dog &ldquo;charging&rdquo; and &ldquo;snarling with bared teeth,&rdquo; with its head lowered, the report states. As Reed &ldquo;retreated,&rdquo; he saw that the dog was on a leash, he wrote in the report. &ldquo;However, I saw that the leash was long enough to allow the dog to reach me before I could get away.&rdquo; With no time to &ldquo;yell at the dog or use a less lethal deterrent,&rdquo; Reed wrote, &ldquo;I instinctively drew my handgun and fired once, striking the dog in the top of the head.&rdquo; The one shot killed Scarlett. Reed was not injured during the incident.\r\nThe sheriff&rsquo;s office has reviewed the audio from Reed&rsquo;s body microphone, which was worn while he was at McGlone&rsquo;s home. The time in which Reed had to retreat or avoid injury by the dog, Brandon said, was just seconds. When Reed turned the corner of the back of the house to knock on a window, there were no signs of a dog in the backyard, Brandon said. It&rsquo;s possible that Scarlett was in her doghouse on the other end of the yard when Reed turned the corner. Reed has been with the sheriff&rsquo;s office for at least five years, Brandon said. It&rsquo;s rare, he said, that any deputy would have to resort to killing an animal while on duty. But, in the course of nearly 70,000 calls for service a year, he said, law enforcement officials face a lot of unknowns when arriving on scene. During property or welfare checks like the one at McGlone&rsquo;s house, dispatcher workers and deputies often are not told by family members that a dog or other animal will be on scene. But, Brandon said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s good information to have.&rdquo;\r\nIt helps keep animals and officers safer, he said, when more information is given to dispatch and relayed to officers. Scarlett usually protected the house by barking when someone pulled in the driveway, McGlone said, but the dog had never shown signs of aggression. Typically, Scarlett stayed inside with McGlone. When deputies arrived on Tuesday, Scarlett was on a leash or a tie-out, attached to a run line strung between two poles in the backyard. Even if her dog was aggressive toward the deputy, McGlone said, she thinks the deputy would have had enough room and time to back away.\r\nAnd, Montana said, he thinks the deputy should have realized there was a dog in the backyard before proceeding to the back window. He pointed out that the leash was not fully extended and, based on where Scarlett was killed, it appeared the deputy had shot at &ldquo;point blank range.&rdquo; A sign that reads &ldquo;Bad Dog&rdquo; was attached to Scarlett&rsquo;s doghouse in the yard. Montana says the sign was put there as a joke by one of McGlone&rsquo;s relatives. After Tuesday&rsquo;s shooting, one neighbor told Reed on Tuesday that Scarlett had tried in the past to bite his niece, causing him to call Animal Control, the report states. The Herald could not reach that neighbor on Wednesday. York County Animal Control officials told The Herald that the department has no record of a call regarding an aggressive animal at McGlone&rsquo;s residence or the neighbor who talked with Reed. It&rsquo;s possible that the neighbor complained about the dog to another agency, thinking he was calling Animal Control, said Steve Suber, the agency&rsquo;s director. Police records show that a warning was issued in January at the home for a leash law violation for the dog running loose, Brandon said. McGlone said sometimes Scarlett would get off her leash but that another neighborhood dog often ran loose and some people would blame her dog for those problems. A neighbor across the street from McGlone&rsquo;s house said she was shocked at the news because she thought Scarlett &ldquo;was a sweetheart dog,&rdquo; said Shana Renzema. She didn&rsquo;t see or hear Tuesday&rsquo;s incident. She and her children sometimes had helped take care of McGlone&rsquo;s dog while she was away. She&rsquo;d never noticed aggression or behavior problems with Scarlett. After McGlone was notified on Tuesday that a deputy had killed her dog, a sheriff&rsquo;s office supervisor met with her at her home. The sergeant seemed &ldquo;compassionate&rdquo; about the loss of Scarlett, McGlone said. He offered to have Animal Control remove Scarlett from her yard. McGlone says she can&rsquo;t even think about replacing Scarlett. Her grandmother &ndash; who died in December &ndash; had helped pick Scarlett out from the shelter. She adopted Scarlett and her two cats Rhett Butler and Tara around the same time. &ldquo;She just attached herself to us. It was love ever since,&rdquo; McGlone said. As Montana dug a hole in the yard for Scarlett&rsquo;s burial, McGlone sat inside her home, looking at pictures of Scarlett, as her cats meandered around the yard and onto the porch. McGlone was still in disbelief, she said, and wished she&rsquo;d done things differently before leaving the house on Tuesday. &ldquo;Something told me to just bring Scarlett in and I didn&rsquo;t. And I beat myself up for that.&rdquo; ','http://www.heraldonline.com/2014/03/05/5742510_officer-shoots-kills-dog-in-york.html?rh=1','Scarlett','Jonathan Reed','0','0',2,0,0,'0','2','Uniform','0','1','0','0','2','0'),(915,'2014-06-21','Alaska','Juneau','Juneau Police Department',1,100,0,'Black Bear','Alaska authorities say they have shot and killed a black bear that lumbered through the front door of a home in the state&rsquo;s capital while people were inside.

Seidl said some of the animals had been at the city&rsquo;s &ldquo;Animal Protection and Safety Shelter&rdquo; since November &mdash; unclaimed and unadopted. &ldquo;We stretched out as long as we could,&rdquo; Seidl said. &ldquo;At one point in time, we were completely full.

The Alaska Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said it would have tried to help find homes for the animals, but Houston animal control hadn&rsquo;t contacted the agency. &ldquo;There are more humane ways of killing animals than taking them out and shooting them,&rdquo; said Cindy Liggett, who operates Kitty and K-9 Connection animal rescue in Anchorage &ldquo;We are not a poor society.

Purcell denied issuing any such order. &ldquo;Animal control keeps them for three to five days and then they&rsquo;re disposed of in a legal way. But I don&rsquo;t get told when they dispose of dogs,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I know our officers try really hard to find homes and we keep dogs longer than any other.&rdquo; Purcell said the city was working to have its animal control officer licensed by the state to euthanize animals by lethal injection rather than having a veterinarian do it at greater cost. He said euthanizing by gun is common in rural areas around the state. Sally Clampitt, executive director of the Alaska SPCA, said lethal injections are for more humane than is terminating a dog&rsquo;s life by gunshot. &ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s really horrible, frankly,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Our position is that euthanasia done by a licensed veterinarian is the preferred and most humane way.&rdquo;','http://www.adn.com/article/20100202/killing-shelter-animals-raises-uproar','Unknown','Charlie Seidl, Charley McAnally, Mayor Roger Purcell','1','0',0,0,0,'3','3','Not Sure','3','3','0','0','0','0'),(917,'2014-06-14','Ohio','Dayton','Dayton Police Department',1,2,1,'Pit Bull Puppy 4 months old','Saturday night, the 100 block of McReynolds Street became the scene of an active investigation after witnesses said an officer wrongly shot a puppy. Dayton police officers originally responded to the east side area to address three adult dogs, including a white pit bull, that witnesses said were on the loose after attacking another neighborhing pit bull. Jenah Pearson and her husband, Curtis Gifford told 2NEWS that while chasing a dog an officer opened fire on Tike, their 4-month-old pit bull puppy. The bullet hit the tri-colored pit bull in his left hind leg, sending him to the vet according to the owners. Saturday they said they want justice for their pit bull. However, police officials had a different story. Officials said Officer Jason Olson tried to secure one loose dog in the alley when the puppy charged towards him, causing him to open fire. But Pearson and Gifford deny that version. The two own a licensed kennel, Roscoe&rsquo;s House of Blues, and said their $5,000 show dog was trained to stay on their property; in fact, they allege Tike was inside their gate going to the bathroom when they said the officer attacked. &ldquo;I heard my neighbor screaming, &lsquo;They shot your dog, they shot your dog&rsquo; and then when I went out there I found my puppy laying in a pool of blood,&rdquo; said Gifford. Moments after the shooting, two of the three dogs were caught and taken away by Montgomery County Animal Resource Center. At least eight police cruisers responded to the scene, as growing crowd surrounded the neighborhood. One man, Gifford&rsquo;s brother, was later arrested after jaywalking and refusing to provide his identification. Following this incident and a family member&rsquo;s arrest, the owners said they want an apology and for Officer Olson to be held accountable. &ldquo;Right now, I feel the police department should be sued for my medical bills and for two they should be sued for the fact that my dog will never be able to placed in a show again,&rdquo; said the owner. Saturday&rsquo;s incident is not the first time Dayton police have shot a pit bull; however, Sergeant Steven Bauer believes the breed is not the problem. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s just a pit bull problem that we have. I think it&rsquo;s a problem where the dogs aren&rsquo;t socialized with other people and other animals from being kept outside on chains 24 hours a day 7 days a week,&rdquo; he said.

The officers took it immediately to Pet Emergency, and it had to be euthanized.&quot; Two other officers talked Butler out of the home about 7:30 p.m. and arrested him for the warrants and on additional charges of assault, resisting arrest and violating a domestic violence restraining order.

Lying on a garage floor sprinkled with blood splatter, the empty bed reminds the Guzman family that Bella was shot and killed by a Victoria police officer on Monday night. &quot;My dog died doing what she was supposed to do, protecting me and my babies,&quot; Jacob Guzman, one of the dog&#039;s owners, said Tuesday. Two-year-old Bella was shot when a Victoria police officer entered the Guzmans&#039; garage at 1710 E. Rosebud Ave. while searching for a discarded gun. At 7:16 p.m., officers were dispatched to the Guzmans&#039; neighborhood to look for a man who was reportedly walking down the street with a gun in his right pocket, said Victoria Police Chief Bruce Ure. &quot;Police confirmed there had been several acts of criminal mischief in the area where a pistol shaped like a BB gun had been used,&quot; Ure said. &quot;If someone carries an object that is designed to look like a handgun, our officers will treat that as a real gun.&quot; Upon locating the suspect, the first officer on the scene witnessed the suspect take something out of his pocket and throw it toward a garage door that was partially open. After a second officer arrived, one officer detained the 18-year-old suspect while the other officer went to look for the possibly discarded gun. The officers&#039; names were not released. While searching for the gun, the officer peered underneath the partially open garage door and saw Jacob Guzman and the gun, which at first glance, appeared to be a Sig semi-automatic handgun, according to the officer&#039;s report. He also heard a dog barking loudly. The Guzman family described the gun owner as a family acquaintance, but said they did not know why he chose to throw the gun in their garage. After the garage door was lifted, the officer saw Bella attached to a dumbbell weight in the middle of the floor and visibly upset. He instructed Jacob Guzman to put the barking Bella inside the house.\r\nGuzman followed the officer&#039;s instructions, but soon after, a 7-year-old family member inadvertently opened the house door, enabling Bella to re-enter the garage, The officer&#039;s report indicated Guzman was unable to restrain Bella, who came charging toward the officer growling and snarling with her head twisted sideways in an attempt to bite. The officer shot Bella, who was within inches of biting him. Six children, ranging in ages from 1 to 8, witnessed the shooting from inside the Guzman house.\r\n&quot;They are traumatized, wanting to know why she was shot in the garage,&quot; said Maria Guzman, one of Bella&#039;s owners. &quot;We certainly wish that the Guzman&#039;s dog hadn&#039;t got shot. Unfortunately, our officer was left without any options,&quot; said Ure, adding that animals are occasionally harmed while officers investigate crimes. &quot;You have to remedy these situations quickly and safely.&quot; The family and neighbors said the officer shot Bella a total of three times. After being shot, Bella ran to her front porch and clawed to get inside, Jacob Guzman said. She died shortly afterward on the porch. Ure contends the officer followed correct procedure in handling the situation.\r\nThe Guzman family, who raised Bella since she was 2 days old, was upset over the officer&#039;s actions. &quot;She&#039;s aggressive, but she was on her own property,&quot; said Maria Guzman. &quot;He shot her for protecting her family.&quot; Maria said the problems could have been avoided by not going into the garage in the first place. &quot;There should have been a different type of procedure,&quot; said Maria Guzman, who cried as she held Bella&#039;s brown collar. &quot;If he heard her barking, why not just come to the front door?&quot; Her son expressed similar sentiments. By all accounts, the Guzmans described Bella as a loving, well-mannered dog that loved children and never attacked anyone.

Police were called to a home on Gilmore Street at 5:41 p.m. Tuesday in response to a complaint from a resident who said a neighbor&#039;s dog had chased him the day before &quot;and three or four times prior to that,&quot; the report states. The police report listed the dog as a pit bull, but the owner&#039;s roommate, Natalie Macias, said he&#039;s a 75-pound American Bulldog named Whitey. The neighbor complained that Whitey attacked his own dog, which was chained in his yard, as well as other people in the neighborhood. Police said they spoke with other neighbors who told them the dog had chased them. The officer who responded was able to reach the dog&#039;s owner by phone. The owner said he was on his way home from Charlotte. While officers waited at the home with animal control, Whitey charged the fence and later escaped through a hole. The dog then charged the police officer, who &quot;defended himself from the advancing [dog] by discharging his firearm at the [dog],&quot; which died as a result of his injuries, according to the report. Macias believes the use of deadly force was unnecessary, and said the neighbors&#039; accounts of the dog&#039;s viciousness were exaggerated. &quot;They could&#039;ve subdued the dog with a tranquilizer. Shooting and killing him is just outrageous,&quot; said Macias. &quot;Whitey was great with kids and never hurt anyone. Too many dogs are killed for no reason these days and it&#039;s just sad.&quot; Macias also said Whitey&#039;s heightened aggression Tuesday evening could been attributed to a female dog being in heat. The dog&#039;s owner was issued a ticket by animal control for alleged violation of the county leash law. The dog was hit with eight bullets, and three shots missed the dog.

The incident occurred at approximately 12:05 p.m. today, Monday, as a 74 year old Ellendale woman went to visit her daughter at a residence located in the 20000 block of Saw Mill Road in Ellendale, DE. The daughter was the owner of a Pit Bull dog which she had put away prior to the victim entering the residence for the visit. After a period of time, the victim advised her daughter that she was leaving and in fact left the residence. However, the victim had left something behind and re-entered the home. The daughter, not knowing that the victim had come back into the house, released the dog from the room it had been in. The dog then attacked the victim causing serious injuries to her. The dog owner was unable to subdue the animal as this was occurring. As responding Troopers arrived, the dog, which had not stopped its attack on the victim, became aggressive towards them, and had to be put down. Its body was turned over to the SPCA. The victim was transported by helicopter to the Beebe Medical Center where she was stabilized. She was then flown to the Christiana Hospital in Newark, where he was admitted. Her condition is unknown at this time. There were no other injuries. This incident remains under investigation.

The suit is Jane Flint v. City of Milwaukee et al Case Number: 2:2014cv00333. Filed: March 25, 2014 in Wisconsin Eastern District Court.\r\nFlint claims Milwaukee police shot to death two of her four friendly dogs while searching her house for dangerous animals - and all they found were turtles. Flint says it happened like this: In May 2010 she was living in a home owned by her boss, nonparty Terry Cullen. According to the 19-page lawsuit, Cullen bred and rehabilitated reptiles, including crocodiles, snakes and alligators, for zoos and humane societies. On May 7, 2010, police Det. Phil Simmert and another officer took a complaint from an informant who claimed that while considering an internship with Cullen, &quot;he treated her in a sexually inappropriate manner, and that he was illegally handling and keeping various reptiles, including alligators, in various locations,&quot; Flint says in the lawsuit. The informant also claimed that Cullen took her to Flint&#039;s home, according to the complaint. &quot;The informant then informed Detective Simmert that when she and Mr. Cullen entered Ms. Flint&#039;s residence, she was introduced to four dogs which were claimed to be Tibetan wolves. The informant told Detective Simmert that the &#039;wolves&#039; were &#039;somehow tamed and trained.&#039; &quot;The potential presence of four wolves in a Milwaukee residence was of interest to law enforcement, but somehow between May 7 and May 10, 2010, it was established that the animals originally described as Tibetan wolves by the informant were, in fact, Tibetan mastiffs. After they were learned to be Tibetan mastiffs, they were no longer of investigatory concern,&quot; the lawsuit states. Flint claims that on May 10, 2010, Det. Simmert contacted her and she told him that she was responsible for the care of the Tibetan mastiffs only, and was not in charge of any animals while Cullen was away.\r\nSimmert applied for and received a search warrant for Flint&#039;s residence. The warrant stated that Simmert was investigating the possibility of a threatened or endangered species and that Flint&#039;s residence had four purported Tibetan wolves, according to the complaint. Flint claims Simmert contacted a conservation warden from the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources to assist him in the search, because he believed that there would be a Chinese alligator in Flint&#039;s residence. Two days later, on May 12, Flint says, one of Cullen&#039;s employees called and told her that Simmert was executing a search warrant for her property. &quot;Ms. Flint immediately called Detective Simmert and told him she would leave work, and get home as soon as she could,&quot; the complaint states. &quot;Ms. Flint asked Detective Simmert to please wait so that she could have the opportunity to either confine her dogs or have a friend come and pick the dogs up so that the dogs would not be present during the search.&quot;\r\nIgnoring Flint&#039;s plea, Simmert executed the search warrant before she could retrieve her dogs. &quot;Ms. Flint&#039;s dogs were barking, but they did not approach the officers, they did not growl or show teeth, and they were wagging their tails,&quot; Flint claims. The conservation warden, nonparty Blankenheim, entered the house after it was cleared by Milwaukee police and saw some turtles in a glass cage, and heard a police officer yelling at Flint&#039;s dogs to lie down. &quot;After several minutes in the house, Warden Blankenheim heard the MPD tactical officer yelling for the dogs to get back. Warden Blankenheim heard several shots from an assault rifle and heard MPD officers saying two dogs were down,&quot; the complaint states. Flint says that when her dogs were shot, they were in a retreating position. When Flint finally arrived, she was told that the defendants had already shot two of her dogs. She was arrested for an &quot;on-the-scene determination&quot; that she had violated two state animal laws. Flint claims she was held and shuffled around jail as the defendants tried to concoct trumped-up felony charges to keep her there. &quot;Milwaukee Police Department records indicate that Ms. Flint was arrested on-view on May 14, 2010, at 5:13 p.m. and booked at 5:25 p.m. for felony charges of Viol/Endang/Threat S 29.604 [629 9MU] and Intentionally Mistreat 951.02 [620 1MA] However, Ms. Flint had already been arrested and held for more than 48 hours at this point,&quot; the complaint states. Flint was released from jail on May 15, 2010. Charges against her were dismissed; she was allowed to retrieve her two remaining living dogs for a fee and was issued two citations for possessing two midland painting turtles and seven common snapping turtles without a license. She seeks punitive damages for constitutional violations. She is represented by Jeff Olson, of Madison. A Chinese businessman last week paid $1.9 million for a single Tibetan mastiff puppy. It&#039;s believed to be the highest price ever paid for a dog.

According to Tehama County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office the CHP officer, Matt Nelson said he was running in the area and the two dogs came after him.\r\nBut the owners said that&rsquo;s not what happened. The Torres family said they are devastated that their two, eight-month-old dogs were shot and killed. &ldquo;We were looking in on the house that&#039;s in front of us and we heard six consecutive gun shots,&quot; said Alex Torres. Torres said his family let the dogs out for a couple of minutes. He said they then started to worry when they couldn&rsquo;t find them. While they were calling for them, Torres said he heard gun shots. &quot;My mom was telling me to take me over there where we heard the gun shots,&rdquo; said Torres. Torres said he drove to the other side of his house and that&rsquo;s were they found his puppies on the ground, with gun shot wounds. Torres said he saw CHP Officer Matt Nelson standing over his dogs.\r\n&ldquo;My first reaction, obviously I was telling him why did he do that, and he just put his hand up to me like don&#039;t talk to me,&quot;said Torres. Both parties called Tehama County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office, who came out and took a report. And to the dismay of the Torres family there was no further investigation. Torres said he can&#039;t understand why the off-duty officer would shoot his pups since they were friendly dogs. &quot;Everyone knew them in this area,&quot; said Torres. We tried getting more information but officials at the Williams CHP Office, the office Nelson patrols from, refused to comment. The Tehama County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office said it wasn&#039;t their investigation and referred us to the Red Bluff CHP. But Red Bluff CHP won&#039;t own this investigation either.\r\nThe Torres family said they still have questions and can&#039;t believe they can&#039;t get any answers from the different agencies. The Torres family said what the Williams CHP officer took from them is irreplaceable and that the pain of losing their dogs is almost too much to bear. &quot;We can&rsquo;t get them back just something we&#039;ll never get back again,&quot; said Torres.','http://m.krcrtv.com/offduty-chp-officer-shoots-dogs-owners-call-for-investigation/24210556#.UusZ1lR5GqQ.facebook','Unknown','Matt Nelson','2','0',2,0,0,'0','2','Plain Clothes','0','3','0','0','2','0'),(950,'2012-12-04','Wisconsin','Milwaukee','Milwaukee Police Department and Milwaukee Fire and Police Commission',1,50,0,'Dalmation, 7yo','Sonja and Vaughn Schroeder are upset after a Milwaukee police officer shot and killed their seven-year-old Dalmatian dog. However, a Milwaukee Police Department spokeswoman says there is more to this situation than what the Schroeders allege. Sonja Schroeder told FOX6 News her husband had just arrived home from the hospital early Tuesday morning, December 4th. She saw his cab arrive from her upstairs window, and let their dog Shandar down the stairs into their narrow hallway to greet Vaughn &mdash; as the dog always did. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know there was a cop in the hallway,&rdquo; Sonja said. Vaughn heard the shots as he stepped onto the porch. &ldquo;I just see the cop standing there and my dog laying there all bloody. I just said &lsquo;you killed my dog,&rsquo; and he didn&rsquo;t say nothing,&rdquo; Vaughn said. A Milwaukee Police Department spokeswoman sent FOX6 News a statement saying the veteran officer was at the home to do a welfare check on Vaughn because Sonja had called earlier about him having inhaled glue. When the officer arrived, he knocked on the door, and announced he was a police officer, before he heard barking and went back down the stairs. The statement goes on to say the officer: &ldquo;shouted for Sonja to grab the dog. The dog charged down the stairs, tail down, showing teeth and gums and growled at the officer, coming straight toward him. Officers are trained to stop the threat. The officer had no means of escape, and fearing for his safety, discharged his gun until the threat was stopped.&rdquo; Waukesha County Technical College Dean of Criminal Justice Brian Dorow says officers only have a split second to react in these types of situations. &ldquo;If they perceive that threat, they are justified to take actions and protect themselves,&rdquo; Dorow said. Sonja said she never heard anyone downstairs. Vaughn says the glue situation was a mistake he is embarrassed about. Both of the Schroeders feel it has nothing to do with how Shandar died. &ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t understand. There couldn&rsquo;t have been some other course of action he could have taken?&rdquo; Sonja said. &ldquo;They killed my dog. That&rsquo;s all I have to say,&rdquo; Vaughn said.

Owners of the dog could not be reached Wednesday.

Burns noted that another dog in the room, a pit bull terrier named Janie, ran to a bedroom when she heard the gunshot. Police had said that the dog was aggressive when officers entered the house on Sept. 15 in the 5300 block of McQuade Street. Just days before Willy was shot, police had arrested Dustin Keeble at the house on suspicion of stealing a car, evading arrest and possession of a controlled substance.\r\nOfficers were back at the house for additional evidence.

Good Samaritan citizens attempted to get the attackers off the little dog but were put in danger along with small children and other adults in the park. Police tried to pepper-spray the worst of the two, but when it made its third return to attack the helpless prey, Patrol Officer Mark Bunting put a bullet from his .40-caliber Glock pistol behind its right ear, reported Detective Sgt. Pedro Medina, Trenton police spokesman. Animal Control Officer Jason Riley disposed of the remains. Nobody in authority could tell The Trentonian what happened to the second pit bull. A police report did not identify the owner of the dogs or say whether charges are forthcoming. The owners of the little dog, Michelle Williams, 51, and Charles Page, were said by a neighbor and friend to have been unable to pay the $1,000-a-night fee for treatment at a veterinary hospital and are trying to bring it back to health at home. Medina said the animal bled profusely from bites on its head, facial area and three of its limbs. Another human victim, Michael Levine, was bitten on the right hand after the pit bull broke free from his grip. Medina said Levine refused hospital treatment. Witnesses called and told The Trentonian that the pit bulls &quot;attacked another dog and ripped him apart&quot; in the incident. High-visibility police patrols in the 400 block of Hamilton Avenue were flagged down by Michelle Williams in the first block of Division Street, waving her arms and crying hysterically in the middle of the street, screaming, &quot;Hurry, please help!&quot; Medina said. &quot;At that time, the officers saw there were several citizens gathered in a group, and when they (the officers) exited their car, they saw two pit bull dogs attacking a smaller dog, with several citizens attempting to pull the two aggressive dogs off the small dog,&quot; Medina said. &quot;As they approached the group, the citizens were able to successfully separate the dogs,&quot; he said. &quot;Michael Levine picked up one of the pit bulls and started walking toward Division Street, and an unidentified black juvenile was directed by Levine to grab the other pit bull by the leash and was struggling to pull the dog away toward Division Street. &quot;Charles Page was kneeling by the victim dog when suddenly one of the pit bulls broke loose by biting Levine&#039;s right hand and running directly at Page and the smaller dog and began biting it again as Page was still holding it.&quot; Police tried a burst of department-issue pepper spray, but it had no effect on the raging beasts; &quot;they continued to bite at the smaller dog&#039;s neck,&quot; Medina said. Incredibly, the smaller dog broke free from the killer and ran for safety, &quot;but the pit bull quickly started chasing the smaller dog through several small children and citizens who were in the park,&quot; he said. &quot;Citizens became frightened and several then ran in the opposite direction. The pit bull then caught the small dog for the third time and began to attack it in a more aggressive manner. And with no other means available, Officer (Mark) Bunting discharged a single round from his department issue Glock. Killed the dog.&quot; Medina said the small dog ran back to its home on Conrad Street where it resides with Williams and Page.','http://www.trentonian.com/article/TT/20101108/NEWS/311089984','Unknown','Police Officer Michael Bunting and Animal Control Officer Jason Riley','1','0',1,0,0,'2','2','Uniform','3','3','0','0','0','0'),(961,'2014-08-21','Arkansas','Alexander','Alexander Police Department',1,2,0,'Unconfirmed','An Alexander woman&#039;s dog was shot by a police chief but both parties are telling different stories.

Officers responded to 608 Carbon St. at about 1:30 p.m. after receiving a report of a possible burglary in progress, Syracuse police said. Officers had responded to the address Friday night for a possible burglary in progress, but couldn&#039;t confirm a burglary had taken place or find the homeowner. A K-9 officer, his dog and another officer arrived at the scene and began checking the outside of the house for signs of forced entry. They found a basement door that was open. The K-9 officer stood near the door with his leashed dog and announced himself. While the officers were still outside the house, a pit bull came through the basement door and attacked the police dog, police said. The officers unsuccessfully tried to get the pit bull to release its bite on the police dog, police said. At the same time, a man armed with an AR-15 rifle came out another door of the house and walked toward the officers. They drew their weapons and ordered the man to drop the rifle, which he did. He was briefly detained. Then the officers immediately turned their attention back to the pit bull, which still had a grip on the police dog. After several more tries to get the pit bull to let go of the police dog, the K-9 officer shot the pit bull once, police said. The pit bull held onto the police dog for about a minute after being shot, but finally released its grip, police said. The pit bull died at the scene. The police dog sustained what appeared to be minor injuries, but will have a veterinary check on Monday. The man who approached with the rifle was identified as Gaetano Colozzi, 23. Police said Colozzi lives at 608 Carbon St. and was not charged in the incident. Nicholas Bartell, who shares the house at 608 Carbon St. with Colozzi, said he owns the pit bull that was killed Saturday. He said Colozzi had earlier invited two women over, who used the basement door to enter the house. Reached by phone on vacation, Bartell said a neighbor who witnessed the incident called him to tell him his 10-month-old pit bull was dead. Bartell said neighbors told him that the police dog attacked his pit bull, not the other way around, and that his dog tried to get away from the police dog. He said the pit bull is very tame and hasn&#039;t bit anyone in the past. Officers later determined that there was not a burglary in progress, but did secure the AR-15 and another rifle for safekeeping because the owner could not be immediately found, police said.

Police say they were called at about 4:30 p.m. Wednesday about an intoxicated person trying to board a bus with an aggressive pit bull at the corner of North Lombard and Interstate. Officers heading to the scene were told the dog tried to attack a person in the area. Shortly after police arrived, the pit bull charged an officer and was fatally shot, authorities say. Jennifer Conway was working at a nearby gas station when she witnessed the shooting. &quot;I was inside the store helping a customer and I turned around and the doors to the store were open and I heard two shots. All I saw was the dog sitting there flinching and the officer had his gun, holding it over the dog,&quot; she said. Police identified the dog&#039;s owner as Richard Cook, 61. He is described as a transient who frequents the area. Cook was arrested on suspicion of reckless endangering, interfering with a peace officer, menacing and disorderly conduct in the second-degree. &quot;I&#039;ve been working here for 14 months. So, I&#039;ve known the dog for 14 months, as well. We feed the dog and we give the dog water every time it comes in and he&#039;s super friendly. He&#039;s never been aggressive toward anyone,&quot; Conway says. Police say the shooting is unfortunate and that even good dogs can be unpredictable. But people familiar with the dog are outraged. &quot;That just seems extreme and it&#039;s unfortunate because he was like a poodle, unfortunately, in a pit bull body and that is where it went wrong,&quot; says Deborah Sampson, who knew the dog. The use of force will be investigated internally, but the officer will not be put on leave. The dog shot by police bit two people late last year in Southeast Portland, including a 2-year-old girl and a skateboarder.\r\nIn a third incident in June, Multnomah County Animal Services advised the dog&#039;s owner, 61-year-old Richard Cook,  to keep the dog muzzled at all times, but he refused and was cited. Wednesday&#039;s shooting unfolded shortly after an apparently intoxicated transient, later identified as Cook, tried to board a bus with the pit bull about 4:30 p.m. at North Lombard Street and Interstate Avenue. As officers headed to the scene, they heard the dog had tried to attack someone, said Lt. Robert King, a Police Bureau spokesman.\r\nWhen they arrived at 4:40 p.m., the pit bull went after Officer Aaron Dauchy, who evaded it without injury, King said. When it charged again, Dauchy, a 12-year Police Bureau veteran, shot it dead. Cook was arrested and lodged at the Justice Center Jail on four misdemeanor counts: reckless endangerment, interfering with an officer, menacing and disorderly conduct. His bail was set at $9,000. King said under Police Bureau guidelines a supervisor will review the shooting to see if it followed bureau policy.\r\nThursday, the Police Bureau released the dog&#039;s history. All three incidents occurred at Southeast 38th Avenue and Hawthorne Boulevard: Nov. 10, 2010: Police responded to a report of a pit bull that had bitten a 2-year-old girl. Cook was booked into jail on an outstanding warrant and his dog was taken by Multnomah County Animal Services. Dec. 15, 2010: Police responded to a report of a pit bull that had bitten a skateboarder. Police again arrested Cook on an outstanding warrant and the dog again was taken by Animal Services. During this call, police said they learned that the pit bull had been trained as a fighting dog. June 2: Police were called to assist Animal Services officers handling a report of an aggressive dog. Animal Services told Cook that because of the two previous incidents, the pit bull was required to wear a muzzle at all times. Cook refused and was cited for a dog that was a public nuisance. People who knew Cook and the pit bull, named Buddy, said they were regulars in the Hawthorne neighborhood and frequently spent their days sitting at Southeast Hawthorne Boulevard and 38th Avenue. Some people placed flowers on the corner Thursday as a memorial. Peter de Garmo, the owner of Pastaworks on Hawthorne, said Cook liked to read on the corner, encouraged other transients to keep the street clean and rarely panhandled. De Garmo noted he had never seen Buddy act aggressively. Pastaworks employees regularly petted Buddy and gave him water and treats. A Pastaworks employee said people who worked in the area broke down in tears when they heard Buddy had been killed. They were not critical of the officer&#039;s decision to shoot the dog, just upset the incident had happened. De Garmo said Cook and his pet were inseparable. &quot;It&#039;s just a tragedy,&quot; he said. &quot;Here&#039;s a guy who is down on his luck and the one relationship that seemed to sustain him was Buddy.&quot;','http://www.kptv.com/story/15328677/officer-shoots-kills-dog-at-n-portland-max-stop','Buddy','Aaron Dauchy','1','0',2,0,0,'1','1','Uniform','3','3','0','0','0','0'),(969,'2010-05-31','Oregon','Portland','Portland Police Bureau',1,2,1,'Unconfirmed','Portland police say they shot a pit bull to death Monday morning after the dog mauled a man and bit a woman.

Police insist the tasers didn&#039;t kill the dog; rather, they say it died from &quot;over-excitement&quot; after multiple 50,000-volt zaps.\r\nPolice tangled with the dog when two officers responded to a call to a Northwest Naito Parkway apartment on the night of June 5. Tenant Aaron Palfoss wasn&#039;t home, so police used a janitor&#039;s key to enter. Police spokesman Sgt. Brian Schmautz says the pit bull attacked an officer, who responded by shooting the dog with his taser. Though the initial shock knocked the dog to the floor, it got up and continued to attack the officers, Schmautz says. The cops hit the dog with at least two more taser darts before it collapsed and died. Minutes later, Palfoss returned with a friend, Taylor Brotherton, who says the apartment was strewn with feces from the frightened dog. Palfoss could not be reached for comment. Taser International, the publicly traded Arizona company that manufactures the popular &quot;non-lethal&quot; stun guns, largely bases claims that its product poses no danger to human life on tests performed on pigs and dogs. Edward Jackson, a Washington, D.C.-based taser expert for Amnesty International, says the human-rights group has documented more than 100 taser-related human deaths, though none in Oregon. The Portland Police Bureau owns 270 taser guns, one for every on-duty officer. Oregon State University&#039;s veterinary lab performed a necropsy on the dog. A preliminary report concludes the pit bull died from circulatory collapse but reaches no judgment on whether repeated taser shocks killed it. To Jackson, the idea that a healthy dog just happened to die after being tasered is tough to swallow. &quot;If you can&#039;t say definitively that it played no role, then you have to say that you can&#039;t rule it out,&quot; Jackson says. &quot;You can&#039;t say the dog died of stress when the 800-pound gorilla in the room is what caused the stress.&quot; Police will not release the incident report on the visit to Palfoss&#039; apartment, citing privacy restrictions.

The dog was treated for injuries and is expected to survive, while the animal&rsquo;s owners may face charges in the incident. According to Kingsport Police Department Deputy Chief David Quillin, the incident began Saturday about 8:20 p.m. Central Dispatch received a call of a vicious pit bull having a woman trapped in an automobile outside her home, 1661 Ridgeway Drive. When KPD Officer Seth Brumfield arrived at the scene, the dog had wandered away from the woman&rsquo;s car, and she was able to gain access into her home through the garage. Police said Brumfield encountered the dog in the vicinity of the incident, and animal control was dispatched to come pick up the dog. However, Quillin said that before animal control arrived, the dog became very aggressive, lunging at the officer and then backing away numerous times. When a second officer, Matt Pendleton, arrived at the scene, the dog reportedly became more aggressive and charged police, forcing them to fire at the animal.\r\nQuillin said the dog&rsquo;s owners could not be located at the time, and the dog was transported to Airport Pet Emergency Clinic in Blountville. &ldquo;My understanding this morning is that the dog will probably live,&rdquo; Quillin said Monday. The dog&rsquo;s owners were later identified as Joyce Epps, 30, and Brandon Johnson, 28, both of 1669 Ridgeway Drive. Quillin said an investigation of the incident is continuing, and the two could face charges.\r\nThe dog&rsquo;s owners had the animal admitted to Indian Ridge Animal Hospital in Kingsport. According to Dr. Michael Bunch, the dog has facial injuries and lacerations to one side, but is otherwise doing well. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s unfortunate that it happened, but the officers clearly didn&rsquo;t have any other choice,&rdquo; Quillin said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just grateful there were not any small children or anyone playing (in the area) or this could be a very different story.&rdquo; The incident marks the second time in less than a week that Kingsport police have shot a pit bull. Quillin said this weekend&rsquo;s case is not expected to be handed over to the district attorney&rsquo;s office. He added that besides the two officers at the scene, numerous other residents witnessed the incident and the dog&rsquo;s aggressive actions.

Police say Johnson Johnson stepped over a low wire fence on Derwood Court, and was &quot;charged by three pit bull/bulldog-type dogs.&rdquo; &ldquo;Those dogs charged at him in a very aggressive manner,&rdquo; Quillin said. &ldquo;(Johnson) tried to retreat, but he did not have that opportunity. They continued to charge at him in a very aggressive manner, and that&rsquo;s when he was forced to fire. As a result, one of the pit bulls died.&rdquo; However, the dog&#039;s owner -- and at least two neighbor&#039;s who allegedly witnessed the events -- immediately and vehemently contradicted the KPD&#039;s version of what had occurred. Richie Hammonds, 1005 Derwood Court, No. 4, owned his dog &ldquo;Mace&rdquo; for three years. Contrary to what police reported, he says there were not three dogs in his back yard when Officer Johnson stepped over his fence, but only Mace; his other two dogs remained on the back porch. And while Johnson&rsquo;s report on the incident states he traveled about 20 feet into the fenced-in yard when he encountered the dogs, the alleged witnesses have told the Times-News that he only placed one foot over the fence. &ldquo;He put his foot back outside the fence, pulled out his weapon and shot him,&rdquo; said Jonathan Suit, Hammonds&rsquo; neighbor. &ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t a noise made, the dog wasn&rsquo;t running. It was just walking toward him.&rdquo; &ldquo;The officer stepped over the fence,&rdquo; said Amanda Bellamy, another of Hammonds&rsquo; neighbors. &ldquo;Mace came out of his doghouse, was walking up to (Johnson) to smell him. The officer stepped back out of the fence, pulled his weapon and shot that dog. That dog would not have come out of that fence. It&rsquo;s an electric fence. They&rsquo;re scared to death of it. The dog walked up to him wagging his tail.&rdquo; Hammonds claims that after the shooting, Johnson said &ldquo;I hate pit bulls.&rdquo; Bellamy and Suit told the Times-News that Johnson remarked he, &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t like those damn pit bulls anyway.&rdquo; Another point of contention for those living in the apartment complex is that police say they were chasing a suspect. Witnesses told the Times-News that responding officers warned children playing outside to get back; that they were looking for two suspicious black males. Following the shooting of the dog, Joe Shupe, 27, a white male that lived in one of the apartments, was arrested and charged with resisting and evading arrest. According to the incident report filed by Johnson, police were called to the area after a report of a suspicious person. While that person &mdash; or persons &mdash; was not apprehended, Shupe &ldquo;looked in my direction then proceeded in a fast walk away from me,&rdquo; according to Johnson&rsquo;s report. Johnson says he broadcast a description of Shupe over his radio and was proceeding in the direction Shupe had gone when he stepped into Hammonds&rsquo; fenced-in yard. According to the police report, Shupe was detained by another officer at nearby Carrington Court when the officer &ldquo;observed a male subject running down the hill towards him.&rdquo; Shupe, according to the report, claimed &ldquo;he was running because he was trying to hide from officers and thought there was a warrant out for him.&rdquo; He was arrested and charged with resisting and evading arrest.\r\n&ldquo;They said they were chasing after two black guys,&rdquo; Hammonds said. &ldquo;They just arrested (Shupe) to make themselves look good.&rdquo; Bellamy says Shupe went up the hill behind his apartment where an officer then asked what he was doing. &ldquo;I guess they decided they better take somebody to jail,&quot; Bellamy said. &quot;They got him for resisting and evading arrest. He didn&rsquo;t resist nothing. They didn&rsquo;t chase him.&rdquo; &ldquo;If he was in pursuit of somebody, and the dog was going to try and bite him, he should have shot the dog and went on after who he was going after instead of standing there,&rdquo; Hammonds said. &ldquo;He stood there and said &lsquo;The reason I shot him was because I hate pit bulls.&rsquo; That was his exact words. It took everything I had not to hit that guy.&rdquo;\r\nLess than two months after the incident at Carrington Court, Officer Johnson fatally shot another pit bull. On Aug. 6, following a call of possible drug activity in the parking lot of Wal-Mart on West Stone Drive, police responded to 2425 Jennings Drive. According to KPD Sgt. David Moore, Johnson fired a single round at a pit bull that cornered him and two other officers on the carport of a home. Ultimately, no one at the residence was charged with any offense. Following the killing, KPD handed its reports on the situation over to Sullivan County District Attorney Greeley Wells. Wells then requested the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation look into the incident. Agent Brian Pritchard was responsible for the TBI investigation and provided a report to DA Wells. Wells referred the matter to a Sullivan County grand jury in December 2009 who ultimately declined to press charges against Johnson. When Pritchard testified before the grand jury he critiqued witness statements that contradicted Darrell Johnson&#039;s version of events, calling them self-contradictory. Pritchard did not elaborate on why witnesses contradicted themselves. He also did not explain why every witness statement taken contradicted Johnson&#039;s story. The grand jury was not also not told that Johnson killed another dig two months after the shooting related to their indictment. &ldquo;The officer&rsquo;s actions were reasonable under all of the circumstances,&rdquo; said the district attorney responsible for prosecuting Johnson.','http://www.timesnews.net/article/9014873/kingsport-police-shoot-pit-bull-after-it-traps-woman-in-car-charges-officers','Mace','Darrell Johnson TBI Agent Brian Pritchard and Sullivan County District Attorney Greeley Wells','2','0',1,0,0,'0','2','Uniform','0','2','0','0','2','0'),(975,'2009-08-08','Tennessee','Kingsport','Kingsport Police Department',1,2,1,'Unconfirmed','On Aug. 6, following a call of possible drug activity in the parking lot of Wal-Mart on West Stone Drive, police responded to 2425 Jennings Drive.

But when he heard the sound of a window sliding open, the 24-year-old got up. Conger&rsquo;s 100-pound pit-bull mix, Cupid, slid into the living room ahead of him. Moments later, the black and white dog was dead, shot by Huntington Beach police officers who had entered the rose-covered double-wide without a warrant. As Cupid turned the corner, making his way toward the noise, Conger said he heard what sounded like three gunshots. He rushed to the scene where he was met with three police officers, his dog lying in a corner. &ldquo;It really didn&rsquo;t make any sense to me,&rdquo; Conger said. Huntington Beach police were unavailable for comment at the time of publication. He added that he did not remember hearing a bark when Cupid went ahead of him into the living room. Had he known police were in the house, Conger said, he would have kept the dog in the bedroom.\r\n&ldquo;Before he got out into the living room the dog was shot and killed,&rdquo; said Conger&rsquo;s father, Robert Conger. &ldquo;And the police officers had gone into the house.&rdquo; Police threw him on the ground and handcuffed him, Casey Conger said. Conger was told that he was under arrest for sicking the dog on the cops, who later un-cuffed then re-cuffed him. Conger told NBCLA.com that he sat in the police car for about an hour and a half before being released.\r\nCasey Conger raised the 3-year-old dog since it was a puppy and said Cupid was attached to him wherever he went. Cupid would bark at strangers, but never physically attacked anyone, Conger added. &ldquo;I can handle what they do to me, but I love that dog,&rdquo; Casey Conger said. &ldquo;What do you expect a dog to do when you come in through the window?&rdquo; Police came in through a plexiglass window, which, Casey Conger said, would be easy to jimmy open but was definitely locked. &ldquo;My heater&rsquo;s broken, so the night before I went through the house and made sure all the windows were closed and locked,&rdquo; he said.\r\nNeighbor Vince Ransom said he came home to find four police cars and several undercover officers at the scene. A month earlier, he said, officers had threatened to shoot Casey Conger&#039;s dog. &quot;A month earlier they came out to the house, and they said, &#039;Why don&#039;t we just shoot the dog?&#039;&quot; Ransom said. &quot;Then yesterday, they came out and they shot the dog.&quot; The Huntington Beach police department, which is investigating the incident, said in a press release that officers had responded to reports that transients were living in an abandoned trailer at the Ocean View Estates Mobile Home Park. &ldquo;Police officers knocked on the doors and windows and yelled inside, but received no response,&rdquo; Lt. Russell Reinhard said in the press release. &ldquo;They entered the trailer and were charged by a pit-bull terrier dog that weighed about 100 pounds. The police officers feared for their safety and one police officer fired his handgun, striking the dog and killing it.&rdquo; Reinhard repeatedly referred to the property as abandoned, and made a reference to Robert Conger as its former owner. Along with the police was an investigator for the city of Huntington Beach, which in an unusual arrangement actually owns the mobile home park. Huntington Beach Lt. John Cottriel, reached by telephone on Friday, said the police department was investigating the incident. He would not comment further. Ransom, the family&#039;s longtime neighbor, said the home was well-kept, and that no one stayed there when Casey Conger was away.\r\nRobert Conger said he and his wife have owned the mobile home in the park for twelve years. They rent the plot where it is located from the city. The family is behind on its $314 monthly rent to the city, but just by one month, Conger said. The elder Congers moved to Sacramento three years ago, but their son continued to live there, Robert Conger said, with the full knowledge of neighbors and the local police. Far from being abandoned, Robert Conger said, the property has a barbecue out front. Over Thanksgiving, he drove down from Sacramento, trimming roses and helping a neighbor put up Christmas lights. His son, Conger said, has had some difficulties, including teen-age drug issues and an encounter with police last month. But that didn&rsquo;t give officers the right to climb in through Casey&rsquo;s window and shoot his dog. &ldquo;My son didn&rsquo;t deserve this,&rdquo; Conger said.','http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Police-Kill-Pit-Bull-135318658.html','Cupid','Three Unknown Police','2','0',2,0,0,'0','2','Uniform','2','2','0','0','2','0'),(977,'2011-12-12','Mississippi','Gulfport','Gulfport Police Department',1,2,1,'Unconfirmed','On Monday afternoon, one family&#039;s Pit bull was shot and killed in his own yard.

And she shot between five and six rounds at my dog,&quot; Lovato remembered. &quot;I looked at her and I was shocked. And I said, &#039;I can&#039;t believe you just shot my dog,&#039; and I proceeded to go back in the house.&quot; Melmo was a big dog, more than 120 pounds, but the animal was on a chain in Lovato&#039;s back yard. Lovato questioned the use of deadly force. &quot;The officer was standing approximately right about here, about 30 feet away from where the chain ends.&quot; After the shooting, the dog&#039;s obviously distraught owner brought the animal for treatment at the Gulfport Veterinary Hospital, but it was too late. The wounds were too severe and the animal could not be saved. Dr. Jerry Spears is the veterinarian who treated Melmo. &quot;From the wounds that I examined, it looks like it had a spinal injury which paralyzed him from the hind legs,&quot; Dr. Spears said. &quot;Profuse bleeding from his mouth, plus some internal injuries, both of which led us to euthanize the animal.&quot; Police are looking into the incident, according to Lt.

Petersen said.  &quot;I feel really bad for the gentleman and the loss of his dog, but we&#039;ll conduct the internal investigation.&quot; He also said that officers have to make life and death decisions in an instant, including assessing threats from animals. &quot;The officer has discretion in how to protect themselves in these situations, totally up to the officer based on the facts and circumstances of that particular case.&quot; But this case has left a hole in Lovato&#039;s heart that won&#039;t heal anytime soon. &quot;I&#039;ve had her for 11 years.

It was reported that these dogs had killed a cat, had menaced some children, and one individual jumped on the hood of his car when he saw the dogs running loose. When the Police arrived on scene, they snared the dogs, placed them in the back of a van commonly used to transport prisoners, took them to a remote location near the City&#039;s incinerator. Once they arrived at the incinerator, the dogs were removed from the van, each dog was then shot in the head, and their bodies are believed to have been thrown into the City&#039;s incinerator.The dog&#039;s owner had left them in his yard, which was enclosed in a 6 foot wooden fence, while he went to work for the day.\r\nWhen he returned home, he noticed that the gate was open and his dogs were gone. He immediately called 911 to report them missing and then set about making a flier and posting it throughout the Midtown and Uptown areas of Harrisburg. For the next several days, the owner continually called the City Police to see if his dogs and been located and scoured the City looking for his dogs. Sometime the following Tuesday, the story about what had happened to the dogs was leaked to the Media. After the story broke, that City of Harrisburg Police contacted the dogs owner to tell them that they had &quot;euthanized&quot; his dogs. The owner was told the information provided above and when he asked where his dogs bodies were, he was denied an answer. \r\nThe owner distraught and frustrated, went to the media and subsequently found himself arrested on an old warrant from 2008. The warrant was served and it should be noted that the owner had the same address and phone number and was unaware that the warrant was pending. The Harrisburg City Police then began a media campaign letting it be known that new charges were pending on the dogs owner for the City Police shooting his dogs. The charges alleged were that the dogs were not vaccinated-this later turned out to be untrue, that he had let us dogs run loose, and that they were not licensed with the City which is a $6.00 yearly fee. Pennsylvania state law requires all animals to be held for a period of 48 hours. The purpose of this is two-fold. One reason is so their rightful owner may have the time needed to locate them. The other reason is that a behavioral evaluation, by a trained specialist, could be conducted. This requirement also extends to animals deemed &quot;dangerous&quot;. The City could have made arrangements to house the animals with the following means: The Carriage House (a stable owned and operated by the City&#039;s Animal Control Officer), one of the many K9&#039;s units the City currently has in operation, placing a call to a local rescue, or contacting neighboring Police Department (Susquehanna Township) who has kennel space.

For several days, the police had been looking for the pit-bull-type canine after having received a number of complaints. When they arrived they found the dog, which appeared to be &quot;dying on the ground,&quot; at the Green Street School playground, according to a press release from the police department. &quot;The officers used their years of training and experience and made a decision to put the dog down,&quot; Chief Gene Wrinn told the Reformer on Wednesday. The officers had to shoot the dog twice to kill it. It was sent to a state lab for testing, which determined the dog was not rabid. Wrinn said the town&#039;s animal control officer was not available at the time, so the officers had to use their best judgment. &quot;If they didn&#039;t take this action and if that dog had remained loose and had bit someone, who knows what might have happened?&quot; But a resident of the neighborhood, who was on the playground at that time with her husband, their two children, a friend and two other children, believes the officers could have dealt with the situation in a better way. &quot;I&#039;m certainly not going to against the decision they made at the time,&quot; said Isabel Matweecha, &quot;but there could have been better communication between the officers and the people present.&quot; Matweecha said for a number of days following the shooting she was angry and didn&#039;t understand why the officers had to do what they did. Now, she said, she and her family just want to put the trauma of that day behind them. &quot;We felt totally in the dark,&quot; said Matweecha. &quot;There was next to no communication about what was going on.&quot; A few minutes before the shooting, Matweecha and her group were at the Crowell Lot, where the officers told them they were looking for the dog, which they described as not aggressive, but warned them not to approach it if they saw it. They then went down to the playground and the officers arrived shortly thereafter, said Matweecha, and drew their guns. Matweecha, her family and friends were leaving the playground when the shots rang out. &quot;And after all that happened, neither officer came around front to check in on us or let us know what happened,&quot; she said. &quot;It just didn&#039;t seem professional.&quot; Wrinn confirmed that the people on the playground &quot;self-evacuated&quot; when the police arrived. &quot;It&#039;s obviously not ideal that it happened at the school, but that&#039;s where the dog was,&quot; he said. Matweecha said she hopes the police department uses this incident as an opportunity to train its officers in how to best respond to similar situations, including communicating with people in the vicinity and making better use of its animal control officer. &quot;If they really felt and believed that this dog was a threat and could harm us, then they could have told us it was not a good time to go to the playground,&quot; she said. &quot;Things could have been done differently.&quot; By town ordinance, dog owners are required to license their pets at the Town Clerk&#039;s office on an annual basis. They are also required to have control of the dog at all times.

On Sept. 9, the Maine State Veterinarian Don Hoenig had Fryeburg police shoot Michelob, a young black Labrador retriever on suspicion the dog carried rabies. Over the summer, the dog had been in a fight with a skunk and began displaying unusual behavior like acting aggressive and biting.\r\nMichelob&#039;s owner said a female police officer arrived to euthanize Michelob. The dogs owner, Jan Brown, who lives on Morningside Drive, said she remembers the police officer shot Michelob 13 times. Brown thinks authorities should have tried to tranquilize or quarantine Michelob.\r\nThe bullets rang out in sets of three, six and four, according to Brown. Many of the bullets hit Michelob in the gut, instead of the heart. Brown believes the officer kept shooting after the dog died but before it stopped twitching from nerves. Since this ordeal, Brown said she&#039;s suffered anxiety attacks. Brown said neighbors were drawn to the commotion thinking there might be a mass shooting going on in the neighborhood. Before the fight with the skunk Michelob was a loving dog, Brown said. &quot;I&#039;ve never seen anything so bad in my life,&quot; said Brown who owned Michelob with her fiance, Jeff. &quot;I constantly hear every shot in my mind.&quot; Brown&#039;s account differs from police chief Philip Weymouth&#039;s version of the story. Weymouth said the officer probably only had six bullets. The officer couldn&#039;t shoot Michelob in the head because the brain needed to be preserved for testing. Calls to Weymouth for this story were unreturned by press time. The test for rabies ultimately came up negative, meaning the dog did not have rabies, said Hoenig. Weymouth, a self-described animal lover, said the events that day were unfortunate and he hopes never to have that happen again. Since then, a new policy for handle such situations has been created that involves someone authorized to use a dart gun and tranquilizer. Brown said the dog&#039;s previous owner told them that Michelob&#039;s shots were up to date.

Police did not identify the man who was shot, but a witness to part of the incident said it was Martin Ruiz, 18. Police and District Attorney investigators are on scene in the 1100 block of Shelton Street. The man ran from police after he was approached over a suspected probation violation, police said. He was shot and killed at a neighbor&#039;s home, police said. Cpl. Anthony Bertagna of the Santa Ana Police Department said the man was on probation for a weapons violation. After officers approached him, he ran home and released a pit bull, Bertagna said. The dog attacked the officers, and the man ran off to another home four doors down, Bertagna said. Police shot the dog, and continued after the man, Bertagna said. There was an altercation at the neighbor&#039;s home, shots were fired and the man was killed, Bertagna said. There was a weapon found next to the man&#039;s body, Bertagna said, adding that he didn&#039;t know what sort. No officers were injured in the shooting, police said. The number of shots fired and how many officers were involved has not yet been disclosed. Anabel Gil, 22, who lives in the neighborhood, said the man was her 18-year-old cousin, Martin Ruiz. She said she saw her cousin run but the dog did not provoke the officers. &quot;The dog didn&#039;t attack,&quot; she said. &quot;He was barking (because) the police just came inside.&quot; Gil said her cousin ran from the police and jumped the fence into her neighbor&#039;s yard. She said her cousin had nowhere to go and she heard shots being fired. &quot;That&#039;s what upsets me.... He was cornered and had no where to go,&quot; she said. &quot;They don&#039;t want to give us any updates. They just keep pushing us back and that&#039;s what makes me think that there was something wrong.&quot; Gil said her neighborhood is swarming with police officers but her family has been given little information about the incident. Four hours after the shooting, Gil still did not have any information. Neighbors who lived on Shelton Street were told by police they would have to wait up to seven hours before re-entering their homes. A 19-year-old named Martin Ruiz is currently wanted on misdemeanor warrants for grafitti and possession of ammunition. [end of news transcript]\r\nLater, more details emerged. The teenager was approached by two Gang Suppression unit police who told him he had violated his probation. The teen ran. Chasing him to his house, they encountered the dog, which they shot. They continued chasing the boy, finally killing him four houses away from his own. The police claim to have found a knife next to his body. There was a lawsuit against the city, Police Chief Paul M Walter and the two un-named cops who were directly responsible for the killing. Lawyers for the estate of Martin Ruiz asserted in a federal civil rights lawsuit that cops attempted to arrest Ruiz &quot;without reasonable suspicion or probable cause&quot; and then repeatedly shot him in displays of &quot;excessive deadly force.&quot; City officials initially reacted to the December 2011 lawsuit filed at Orange County&#039;s Ronald Reagan Federal Courthouse by denying any wrongdoing and declaring that officers have &quot;complete immunity&quot; to kill citizens. But that stance may not have prevailed after a thorough review of the evidence. January of 2013, the city agreed to a pre-trial settlement before a jury could hear the case in U.S. District Court Judge David O. Carter&#039;s courtroom.

Ray Halteh, 28, said Sgt. Mike Remedios shot and killed Angel on Sept. 25, 2006, in Zamora Park after the dog was &quot;engaged in aggressive playful interaction&quot; with another dog named Buddy that happened to belong to the sergeant. Remedios was coming home from work and heard his wife screaming as she was walking Buddy, said Halteh&#039;s attorney, Eric Safire. Halteh separated the dogs, and no one was in immediate danger, Safire said. But Remedios then identified himself as a South San Francisco police officer and said &quot;step aside&quot; before shooting Angel, the suit said. Remedios &quot;instantly came to the conclusion that plaintiff&#039;s dog was out of control and deadly force was initiated,&quot; said Halteh&#039;s lawsuit, filed last week in U.S. District Court in San Francisco. The sergeant&#039;s dog, Buddy, received &quot;little, if any, medical veterinary treatment and displayed no visual evidence of injury,&quot; the suit said. Police Chief Mark Raffaelli and City Attorney Steven Mattas said Friday that the city conducted an internal investigation into the shooting and found no wrongdoing on the part of Remedios. The sergeant, Raffaelli and the city of South San Francisco are named as defendants in the suit. Raffaelli said another sergeant who was not involved in the case received a death threat as a result of the incident. The source of the threat, who hasn&#039;t been identified, had mistaken that sergeant for Remedios, the chief said. Safire said Remedios overreacted. &quot;If I came home and my dog was fighting with another dog and I happened to have a .45 in my pocket, I&#039;d be in jail,&quot; Safire said. &quot;I think it&#039;s an outrage.&quot; Initially city officials launched an internal police investigation of the incident, but then turned the matter over to an independent investigator because of the shooting&rsquo;s &quot;unique&quot; nature, given that an officer&rsquo;s direct family and pet are involved, City Manager Barry Nagel said. The full name of the officer involved in the shooting has not been released by the city and was not reported by the San Francisco Examiner, despite the fact his name was published a month earlier by SFGate.Com and was available in public court documents. Councilmember Mike Addiego said he &quot;cheered&quot; the independent investigation because a third-party opinion should satisfy those &quot;who are going to judge the officer.&quot;','http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Off-duty-police-sergeant-sued-over-shooting-dog-2497381.php','Angel','Mike Remedios','0','0',2,0,0,'2','2','Plain Clothes','3','3','0','0','1','0'),(989,'2005-07-27','California','Richmond','Richmond Police Department and Richmond Police Department&rsquo;s Professional  Standards Unit',1,50,1,'Pit Bull 18 months old','The city of Richmond has agreed to pay $225,000 to settle two federal civil rights lawsuits filed in connection with the controversial shooting death of a pit bull. Cynthia Peters and Mark Parr accused officers of acting in &quot;reckless and callous disregard&quot; of their constitutional rights when police shot their 1-1/2-year-old pit bull, Blu, on July 27, 2005. The Richmond City Council agreed to pay $210,000 to the couple and an additional $15,000 to Genevia Walker, a bystander who also sued the city in federal court, saying her neck was burned when three bullet casings fired by an officer hit her neck and left her temporarily unable to hear. &quot;We&#039;re happy with the way the case was resolved,&quot; Karen Snell, an attorney for Peters and Parr, said today. Blu was in the couple&#039;s fenced yard on Sixth Street when the officers opened the gate to pursue a suspect and shot the dog 11 times with pistols and a shotgun. When Parr ran up and asked the officers, &quot;Why&#039;d you shoot my dog?&quot; police &quot;pointed their guns at him, kicked and punched him and threw him to the ground,&quot; according to the lawsuit filed by the couple in U.S. District Court in San Francisco. Police arrested Parr on suspicion of obstructing police officers, but no charges were filed. An internal investigation by the police department found no fault with the officers; the couple appealed. The Police Commission in February 2006 ruled in their favor and attributed Blu&#039;s death to insufficient departmental guidelines for handling such situations. In court papers, the city said &quot;the destruction&quot; of Blu was necessary and therefore reasonable, that the force used against Parr was reasonable and that his arrest was lawful. In an unusual move, Richmond Police Chief Chris Magnus apologized to the couple. Magnus told The Chronicle last year that his apology doesn&#039;t necessarily mean he doesn&#039;t support his officers, but that owning up to Blu&#039;s death was the right thing to do. &quot;Being sorry that something happened doesn&#039;t mean that your people acted in the wrong way,&quot; Magnus said. Richmond police have since drafted a policy specifying when officers can use deadly force against dogs and provided training on how to deal with dogs in general. The city paid more than $500,000 in 1998 in connection with a lawsuit over another &quot;unnecessary shooting&quot; of a dog named Champ that belonged to James Fuller. Officers entered his yard in 1991 to speak with Fuller and shot the dog during the exchange. &quot;They did nothing to change their policy until the new chief came along,&quot; said Snell, who nevertheless applauded the city for outlining a policy that bars officers from shooting a dog &quot;if there are nonlethal alternatives.&quot; Attorneys for the city of Richmond did not immediately respond to requests for comment today. Richmond City Councilman Tom Butt said today, &quot;It is regretful that the city was so slow to learn. The adage &#039;once burned, twice shy&#039; suggests that when someone has had a bad experience, he or she is likely to shy away from being in the same position again, having better learned to deal with similar situations. &quot;Previous chiefs did not learn.

A lawyer for club members says a lot of property was destroyed in the raids and some evidence was kept for more than a year.&rdquo; (AP/CNN, Feb. 7). &ldquo;Although they had a week to plan for the raids and knew of the existence of guard dogs, including a Rottweiler, the San Jose police officers failed to do anything to find a non-lethal way of incapacitating the animals, the courts said.&rdquo; (Barry Witt, &ldquo;Hells Angels win nearly $1 million from Santa Clara County&rdquo;, San Jose Mercury News, Feb. 6). More than half the settlement, $530,000, will go to the lawyers representing the club, with the remaining $460,000 to be divided up among victims of the raid.&quot;&quot; The Opinion filed by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in Case number CV-99-20022-JF (see puppycideDB&#039;s FOIA documents section) is more detailed: &quot;&quot;On August 24, 1997, Kevin Sullivan was beaten to death at the Pink Poodle nightclub in San Jose. Linderman of the Santa Clara County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office led the murder investigation. He ultimately determined that Steve Tausan, one of the\r\nnightclub&rsquo;s bouncers and a member of the San Jose Charter of the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club (&ldquo;SJHA&rdquo;), committed the crime. Linderman also suspected other SJHA members and associates of concealing evidence of the murder. The District Attorney&rsquo;s Office charged Tausan with the murder of Kevin Sullivan. On October 6, 1997, Linderman applied for a warrant to search the SJHA clubhouse and the residences of various individuals alleged to be affiliated with the Hells Angels. On the basis of Linderman&rsquo;s 27-page affidavit and the testimony of confidential informants, Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge John Ball issued the search warrants on the same day, authorizing a search of the clubhouse and the individual residences for a security videotape depicting the beating of Sullivan, financial records connecting the Hells Angels to the Pink Poodle, and notes of a Hells Angels\r\nmeeting held five nights after the killing. Police investigative officers recovered meeting minutes after several exhaustive searches, but failed to find the alleged videotape. In January 1998, the District Attorney&rsquo;s Office sought a second set of search warrants for nine residences and the SJHA clubhouse. In support of the application for the second set of warrants, Linderman submitted a 24-page affidavit, which incorporated his October 6, 1997 affidavit. Judge Ball issued the warrants as requested on January 20, 1998. The ten warrants were substantially identical except for the location\r\nand the name of the resident. The second set of warrants again authorized the seizure of a copy of the security videotape, and notes or records of a Hells Angels meeting held on the Friday following the murder of Sullivan. Judge Ball also authorized a search for evidence that showed indicia of Hells Angels affiliation, including &ldquo;any evidence of membership in, affiliation with, activity of, or identity of, any gang, including but not limited to, any reference to &lsquo;Hells Angels.&rsquo; &rdquo; The purpose of this provision in the warrants was to obtain evidence supporting a street gang sentencing enhancement against Tausan under California Penal Code &sect; 186.22 because, allegedly, the murder had been committed in furtherance of the criminal\r\nconduct of the Hells Angels &ldquo;gang.&rdquo; Prior to the January 1998 searches, the Sheriff&rsquo;s Office had arranged for assistance from multiple law enforcement agencies, including the San Jose City Police Department. There were two types of law-enforcement teams that assisted with the execution of the warrants. First, &ldquo;entry teams&rdquo; composed of San Jose City police officers were used to enter the premises surrounding the residences and secure safe entry into the residences. Once the location was secured, &ldquo;search teams&rdquo; composed only of officers from the Sheriff&rsquo;s Office were to conduct the searches and take possession of property covered by the warrant. Leaders of the entry teams were given approximately one-week advance notice of the action in order to prepare for the searches. At 7:00 a.m. on the morning of January 21, 1998, teams of law enforcement officers simultaneously served the search warrants at residences of members of the Hells Angels in various\r\nparts of Santa Clara and Santa Cruz counties. It is the conduct of the law enforcement personnel in carrying out these searches under the second set of warrants that gave rise to plaintiffs&rsquo; claims. 1) Souza Residence - The entry operation at the Souza home was supervised by Sergeant Decena, who learned about the search a week prior to the operation. Officer Newman supervised the search of Souza&rsquo;s residence. He obtained Souza&rsquo;s arrest record, which revealed that Souza had been arrested for weapons and narcotics charges. The team also received background information which showed that there were two guard dogs, one which was a Rottweiler, at the Souza residence. During surveillance before the search, the SJPOs saw a sign on Souza&rsquo;s side gate stating &ldquo;Warning Property Protected By Guard Dog;&rdquo; the officers also learned that Souza owned a Rottweiler that was known to attack without provocation. [...] The SJPOs planned either to isolate or to shoot the dogs, so they would not threaten the safety of the primary entry team. The officers had no plan to use non-lethal methods of incapacitation; nor did they have a specific plan for &ldquo;isolating&rdquo; the dogs or any intention of giving Souza the opportunity to isolate his Rottweiler himself. On the day of the search, the primary entry team entered through the front door of the main house while the secondary team unsuccessfully tried to cut the lock on the side gate with bolt cutters. The secondary team&rsquo;s failure to gain entry through the gate caused them to enter the main house following the first team, at which point the secondary team informed the first team that they had failed to gain access to the backyard through the side gate. Although both teams were safely inside the house, the backyard remained unsecured and the dogs remained on the loose. We note, however, that because Souza was not home the teams could have conducted their search inside the house without hurriedly dealing with the dogs in the backyard. house, two of the officers proceeded to patrol the yard to look for the Rottweiler. Because misc objects and machinery strewn across the yard created obstacles to both motion and sight, the officers kept their firearms (MP-5) drawn. Then, according to Officer Manion: &quot;[t]he [R]ottweiler suddenly appeared around the corner, approaching from the west at a distance of about ten to fifteen feet. It looked at me, gave a low growl, and started advancing toward me. I feared that the dog was going to attack me and I immediately discharged my firearm pulling the trigger twice.&quot; Officer Manion&rsquo;s shots killed the Rottweiler instantly. The SJPOs left unharmed a small white dog that was also present but was judged to pose no threat once the Rottweiler had been killed. 2) Vieira Residence - Sergeant Carney supervised the search operation for the Vieira residence and was given about a week to plan the\r\nsearch. Like Souza, the Vieiras had not been accused of any crime. Officer Messier, the team leader, conducted surveillance and gathered intelligence several days prior to the operation which revealed that: (1) Robert Vieira had prior weapons-related convictions; (2) the Vieira property included\r\na residence and a junkyard completely encircled by a tall, padlocked, cyclone fence, and (3) there might be dogs, although the number and breed were unknown. Messier assigned Officer Nieves the task of handling any dogs that might be present. The plan for entering the property was to cut the lock on the outer fence, approach the house, give knock-notice, then enter and secure the house. At the Santa Clara Sheriff&rsquo;s Office briefing on the morning of the operation, Sergeant Carney was told that the Vieira property, in particular, was guarded by three large dogs. Officer Nieves, who was assigned the duty of protecting the entry team, planned to deal with the dogs in the following manner: First, he hoped that the dogs would not appear at the gate. If they did, he planned to poke them through the fence with his\r\nshotgun and try to scare them. (Nieves carried a shotgun specifically for dogs.) If that did not work, he planned to assess the situation and\r\nengage the dogs, to ensure the safety of the entry team. Because the SJPOs believed that they needed to secure quick entry to preserve an element of surprise and prevent the possible destruction of evidence, they had no intention of calling on the Vieiras to control their dogs. When the entry team approached the Vieiras&rsquo; gate, three large dogs resembling Bullmastiffs emerged and ran toward the gate barking and growling. As the officers stuck their hands through the fence to cut the lock, one of the dogs jumped and snapped at their hands. Although the SJPOs were armed with pepper spray, no officer attempted to use the spray to subdue the dogs.8 Instead, Officer Nieves attempted to scare the dogs away by yelling at them and pushing one of the dogs back with the barrel of his shotgun. The dogs, however, would not retreat, and the persistent barking caused Officer Nieves to fear that the surprise of the mission might be compromised. Officer Nieves pointed his shotgun at one of the barking dogs and shot it. The first dog went down, but the second dog did not retreat. Officer Nieves shot at the second dog twice,\r\ncritically wounding it, causing it and the third dog to retreat. Although he had already shot the first dog at point blank range, Officer Nieves testified that the dog &ldquo;was apparently trying to get back up [a]nd in an effort to ensure that he wasn&rsquo;t going to attack or be a problem for the team,&rdquo; Officer Nieves fired a fourth shot at the dog&rsquo;s head, killing it. The\r\nSJPOs left unharmed the third dog, which retreated to a hiding place away from the officers, and the fourth dog, which was chained in the backyard.\r\nMeanwhile, the noise outside awoke Robert Vieira. He emerged from the house at the second floor balcony just as the officers gained entry through the gate. The police instructed him to remain where he was with his hands up. An\r\nofficer broke through the front door using a ram. When the SJPOs reached Robert Vieira, they located a firearm propped up against the bedroom window.&quot;&quot; The court documents go on to detail how everything with a Hells Angels logo on it was stolen, including the following: belts, jewelry, plaques, t-shirts, hats, watches, vests, calendars, clocks, sculptures, photographs, correspondence, motorcycles, a mailbox, a refrigerator\r\ndoor with decals, and a cement portion of the driveway in front of the clubhouse containing the signatures of Hells Angels members.','http://overlawyered.com/2006/02/hells-angels-get-990-k-for-dead-dogs/','Unknown','Sgt Decena, Sgt Opinion Carney, Ofcr Messier, Ofcr Nieves, Ofcr Michael Fernandez, Ofcr William Manion, Ofcr D.

In 2013, the Colorado Legislature passed the Dog Protection Act, which requires law enforcement officers to receive training on differentiating aggressive and non-threatening behavior and how to employ non-lethal means of subduing an animal. The training comes after a Commerce City officer fatally shot a dog Wednesday when the dog bit the officer&rsquo;s leg and wouldn&rsquo;t release. The officers arrived at the house to look for a suspect in a child abuse case.\r\nThe dog&rsquo;s owner said the officer didn&rsquo;t need to shoot. &ldquo;The other cop had told him he should have Tasered the dog or something first instead of shooting him,&rdquo; Nikkol Hopkins, the dog&rsquo;s owner, said. But Chief Troy Smith said his officer was justified. &ldquo;The dog immediately attacked one of the officers, biting him on the lower leg. The officer was unable to get the dog to disengage,&rdquo; Smith said. The dog, named Bugs, was a mastiff-lab mix and weighed approximately 40-50 pounds. The officer, who hasn&rsquo;t been identified, was treated at a hospital. An investigation is ongoing. Commerce City police have killed dogs in four other incidents since 2009, including the infamous Chloe case that sparked protests and led to increased training for the city&rsquo;s police. Smith said officers&rsquo; training includes the &ldquo;identification of vicious animals, the examples of animal body language, the reasons animals bite&rdquo; and other factors. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy to report that the task force has nearly complete their duties and the training will be up and running next week,&rdquo; Diane Balkin, of the Animal Legal Defense Fund said.','http://denver.cbslocal.com/2014/09/25/after-another-dog-killed-animal-training-begins-for-police/','Bugs','Unknown','2','0',2,2,2,'2','2','Uniform','2','2','0','0','2','0'),(995,'2014-08-02','Texas','New Braunfels','New Braunfels Police Department',1,2,0,'Unconfirmed','The following is taken from a media report based solely on police statements: Police in New Braunfels say they were forced to shoot an aggressive dog as its owner was attempting to trespass on private property.

When the first officer arrived he talked to the boy and says he could see marks on the boy from the dog. The officer says the dog charged him, and that is when he fired three times, hitting the dog twice. Eyewitness news talked to the boy&#039;s mom.

Officer Michael R. Wasik and Lt. Marshall K. Belling responded to a call about suspicious activity at 335 South St. about 3:30 p.m. Saturday. The call was placed by a neighborhood resident. While the officers were in the front yard of 335 South, looking over the vacant premises, the dog entered the backyard &quot;and made a beeline for the officers,&quot; Chief Larry Eggert said Sunday. The dog broke through a locked gate between the front and back yards, tearing out several fasteners as it did, then jumped at one of the officers and tried to bite his face. Mace was sprayed at the dog and officers said it had no effect, as the attack continued, Eggert said. The other officer drew his weapon and shot the dog at least once, possibly twice. The dog then turned on that officer, sinking its teeth into the officer&#039;s bulletproof vest and tearing it. One or two more shots were fired and the dog was killed. Both officers ended up shooting the dog to protect themselves and each other, according to Eggert.\r\n&quot;It was a pretty violent attack,&quot; he said. &quot;There was no stopping that dog.&quot;\r\nSome neighborhood residents were upset with the officers after the shooting, but initial investigation of the incident supports the officers&#039; actions, the chief said. &quot;On our first look at this, it seems like the officers did what they were trained to do. They were being attacked,&quot; he said. The department&#039;s inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the shooting will pick up again today. Among facts to be confirmed is the number of times the dog was shot &mdash; the department is required to account for all bullets, so the dog is being autopsied &mdash; and the identity of the dog&#039;s owner. On Saturday, city animal control officer Joanie Black responded to the scene and determined that the dog was not licensed. Because without licensing there is no proof the dog received rabies vaccination, the dog has to be tested for rabies.

The bullet that went through Carley&#039;s cheek remains embedded in her shoulder. While the shoulder wound gapes open, Carley&#039;s face is swathed in bandages to provide pressure to prevent additional bleeding. Her owner, Ashley Seidel, 29, of Marshfield can&#039;t afford the medical care her dog needs after it was shot by a Wood County Sheriff&#039;s Department deputy. The deputy had responded along with Marshfield Police Department officers to a report that a woman was unconscious and lying on the sidewalk at 5:57 a.m. Sept. 20. When Seidel talked about her dog and the events that led up to Carley being shot, she started to cry. &quot;It&#039;s all my fault,&quot; Seidel says between sobs as she explained that she inadvertently double-dosed herself with over-the-counter sleeping and allergy medication at about 5 a.m. Sept. 20. A week of family tragedy &mdash; her grandmother had died and her boyfriend&#039;s mother was near death &mdash; had pushed her to exhaustion. After she took the sleeping and allergy pills, Seidel says she thought a quick walk outside with her dog would help her sleep. Seidel says she remembers stepping out of her house with Carley on a leash and starting to walk down the sidewalk. &quot;I started feeling drowsy. I didn&#039;t walk far,&quot; she says. What happened next she&#039;s not sure, but Seidel says she felt wide awake when she heard a car door slam. &quot;The next thing I remember is I heard a car door slam and it kind of snapped me out of it. I was sitting on the sidewalk. I must have dropped my phone because it was in my hand but the case was broken, and I wasn&#039;t holding Carley&#039;s leash. I must have been sitting there awhile. &quot;I looked to my side, and I saw there were squad cars and a lot of police. I didn&#039;t hear them say anything and they were walking towards me. I stood up and saw Carley run up. I said, &#039;That&#039;s my dog. Can I get her?&#039; They said, &#039;No.&#039; Then I heard a loud bang, and I said, &#039;Did you shoot my dog?&#039; I couldn&#039;t believe what was happening,&quot; Seidel says. Authorities say the dog was going to attack them, says Lt. Shawn Becker of the sheriff&#039;s department. The deputy, Shannon Tollefson, who has been with the department for six years, fired one round, Becker says. &quot;The dog came out running at the officers. It was justifiable in these circumstances,&quot; Becker says about the shooting. Officers are trained to respond with the force appropriate for the situation, Becker says. The deputy responded to the report because he was close to the area at the intersection of East Fifth Street and South Cedar Avenue. Tollefson was the first officer on scene and was talking with Seidel while she was sitting on the sidewalk, says Marshfield Police Chief Rick Gramza. According to the reports filed by the three responding MPD officers, Seidel was crying because Tollefson had told her she would be arrested for a warrant because she had outstanding fines she hadn&#039;t paid, says Gramza. As the officers walked towards Tollefson and Seidel, they heard a dog growling and saw it running towards them with teeth bared. The dog leaped at one of the Marshfield officers, who backed up to avoid being bitten, and the dog veered and headed for Tollefson, says Gramza. &quot;A - none of the officers knew whose dog it was. B - they needed to protect Seidel and themselves,&quot; says Gramza.\r\nNone of the reports document that Seidel told the responding officers that the dog was her&#039;s prior to it being shot, says Gramza. &quot;No one was aware the dog was her&#039;s. I feel bad this happened. I know our officers have to protect themselves and the community. When something like this happens, there isn&#039;t a whole lot of time to react when a dog is charging you,&quot; says Gramza. After she was shot, Carley ran toward home yelping and barking, which brought Seidel&#039;s boyfriend to the couple&#039;s front door. &quot;I opened the door, and Carley ran in, and there was blood all over the place,&quot; says John Gates, who added he initially wanted to let the dog back outside in order to clean the dog to find out why she was bleeding. &quot;But there were officers right there at the door yelling at me to not let her out because they would shoot her if I did,&quot; Gates says. Gates said he was dumbfounded as he learned a sheriff&#039;s deputy had shot his beloved pet, and Seidel was being arrested for a warrant related to unpaid fines. &quot;Why didn&#039;t they use a Taser or pepper spray? They didn&#039;t need to shoot her like that,&quot; says Gates. While Seidel was in custody, Gates used every towel he could find in the house to bundle Carley and protect her head while he drove to a veterinarian&#039;s office open for emergencies on a Saturday morning. As the couple describes what happened, Carley sleeps, but it is labored because of the pressure wrap around her head. Her breaths are punctuated with tiny whines and yelps from the pain.\r\n&quot;She&#039;s really a good dog. She&#039;s never been the kind of dog to be barking at other dogs or people walking by the house. I always walk her on a leash, and she&#039;s really obedient. She&#039;d never want to hurt anyone,&quot; says Seidel. The initial visit to clean the wounds, bandage Carley&#039;s head and provide pain medication for the dog, along with a series of antibiotics cost $550. For complete care to mend Carley&#039;s mouth, remove the bullet and repair her shoulder was estimated at the most to cost $3,000, Gates says. Gates says he took Carley home that day without paying the bill. Two days later, on Sept. 22, he took the dog back to the veterinarian&#039;s office to check that her wounds weren&#039;t infected and was told the dog would not be seen until the previous bill was paid. &quot;I had enough money to pay for that day&#039;s bill, but they wouldn&#039;t see her unless I paid off the other bill,&quot; Gates says. The couple is working to keep Carley&#039;s mouth clean while also feeding her dog food that won&#039;t stress her mouth. &quot;It&#039;s so important to make sure there isn&#039;t any food stuck in her teeth because it could cause an infection,&quot; says Seidel. Carley&#039;s head bandages also are changed daily while they make sure she swallows all of her medication. &quot;We&#039;re worried. She needs medical. But I&#039;m back in school, and there&#039;s no extra money,&quot; says Seidel.','http://www.marshfieldnewsherald.com/story/news/local/2014/09/29/owner-dog-shot-police-afford-vet-bills/16451461/','Carley','Shannon Tollefson','0','1',2,0,0,'1','1','Uniform','3','3','0','0','2','0'),(999,'2014-04-18','Texas','Austin','Austin Police Department',1,2,1,'Unconfirmed','An East Austin family forced to bury their pit bull Friday night wants to know why Austin police officers shot and killed their pet, instead of using non-lethal force.

According to the APD watch commander, police were responding to an auto theft call on the 4000 block of Prock Lane, just off of Springdale Road around 8:30 pm. According to police, the officers shot and killed the dog from the street after it charged.

She says the dog was being restrained by a family member when officers arrived, but the man let the dog go when he saw police draw their weapons. &quot;I guess when the cops arrived he was all offensive.

Lisa Maclin was hit in the head with a large pellet from a 12-gauge shotgun shell that a Cleveland officer fired at her dog, Dirt, a 3-year-old Rottweiler/Labrador mix, according to the lawsuit filed yesterday. (See lawsuit below in document viewer or here on a mobile device.) The lawsuit names a Lt. Michael Butler as the officer who fired the shots. However, Butler contacted The Plain Dealer Monday and said that is incorrect. Butler, a supervisor in the department&#039;s 5th District, said he was the supervisor on scene, not the officer who fired a weapon. Cleveland police spokeswoman Sgt. Jennifer Ciaccia said an incident did take place but the lawsuit was incorrect in naming Butler. According to the suit, Maclin and her husband, Michael, were walking their two dogs on leashes near E. 140th and Rugby Avenue on Aug. 12, 2012 when Dirt broke free to protect the family&#039;s other dog, Gordo, from an unleashed poodle that was acting aggressively. An officer pulled up in his cruiser and shot three times at Dirt, killing the dog, the suit said. Lisa Maclin, was hit with one of the pellets, which was later removed from her brain at University Hospitals, according to the lawsuit filed in Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court. Attorney Daniel Roth, who represents the Maclins, said the city has hidden information on the incident from the family, including the identity of the officer involved in the shooting. &quot;The city has done everything they could to prevent any information on this coming out,&quot; Roth said. Reached Monday night, Roth said he had to try and find out who the officer was through other channels because the city would not tell him who fired the shotgun or give him any information on the incident. Roth later provided The Plain Dealer with correspondence between his office and city officials dating back to 2012 in which he requested reports on the incident, including the name of the shooter. According to the letters Roth provided, he was told that because the case was open the records were &quot;unobtainable.&quot; Roth said detectives wanted to interview his client but he would not allow it because they city refused to turn over basic information on the shooting. Cleveland Communications Director Maureen Harper declined to comment earlier in the day because the litigation is pending. Cleveland Sgt. Ali Pillow earlier in the day confirmed Butler was a supervisor in the 5th District and said he would forward a reporter&#039;s request for information on the incident and Butler. In an email to The Plain Dealer Butler said he informed the city of the incorrect information in the lawsuit. The lawsuit names Butler, Mayor Frank G. Jackson and former Police Chief Michael McGrath. The suit accuses an officer of using excessive force recklessly in an urban area. Roth said Lisa Maclin has had ongoing medical and psychological issues related to the shooting. He said the pellet removed from her brain was the size of a .32-caliber bullet and was part of one of three shotgun rounds fired at the dog to kill it.

You had already hit her in the chest.&rdquo; A New Jersey State Police trooper and a member of the Mercer County Prosecutor&rsquo;s Office were executing an arrest warrant at 12:30 p.m. Tuesday in an alleyway on the first block of West End Avenue near Derry&rsquo;s home when Poodie appeared, according NJSP Capt. Stephen Jones. &ldquo;This very large dog ran out from behind from a backyard area where there was a fence that wasn&rsquo;t secured,&rdquo; Jones said Wednesday. &ldquo;It ran out of the yard of an abandoned property and charged at the trooper and officer. They both discharged rounds striking the dog and the dog ran away.&rdquo; The officers later found the dog dead in the rear parking lot of Cadwalader Elementary School. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very sad when this type of thing has to happen,&rdquo; Jones said. &ldquo;It unfortunately comes down to protecting life and limb there when you&rsquo;re dealing with a large aggressive animal.&rdquo; But Derry said Poodie was anything but aggressive. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a big baby,&rdquo; said Derry, who just tied the knot last Monday. &ldquo;Of course she&rsquo;s a big dog, but she was a really sweet, humble-type dog. She was very friendly and playful.&rdquo; Derry&rsquo;s husband, Dwayne, said cops came onto the scene with their guns drawn. &ldquo;Why are they going in the back with their guns drawn from the beginning?&rdquo; he questioned. &ldquo;What is your purpose of going in the back of someone&rsquo;s house with your gun drawn?&rdquo; Dwayne Derry said they could have ordered Poodie to stop. &ldquo;She likes to play,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When she sees people, she jumps up wanting to play because she&rsquo;s a playful dog, but shooting her three times was unnecessary.&rdquo;\r\nThe Derrys suggested cops could have pepper-strayed Poodie or shot in the air. &ldquo;They claimed she came at him, but even if that&rsquo;s the case, he could have shot in the air or shot her in the leg,&rdquo; Oweeda Derry said. &ldquo;Why shoot her in her chest and shoot her twice times in the back?&rdquo; Describing proper procedure, Jones explained when a dog is charging, they often move fast. &ldquo;If a situation is occurring and shots are fired within a second, it&rsquo;s not a matter of knowing that you hit a dog and that&rsquo;s the end of it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You got to stop the threat.&rdquo; Jones ruled out other possible uses of force against the animal. The captain said neither officer was carrying a Taser, but it wouldn&rsquo;t have mattered anyway. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s generally not too effective on a charging animal,&rdquo; Jones said. &ldquo;Pepper spray is clearly not effective on most dogs.&rdquo; In the end, Jones said situations like this are a matter of officer safety. &ldquo;If they&rsquo;re there legally serving a warrant on the premises and somebody has a dog that is not controlled, it might be a situation where it&rsquo;s just simply a matter of officer safety,&rdquo; he said.

Shear, who is out of town on business, said he was not at the facility off Broadway when the incident happened so he did not have full details. But he said the dog had been muzzled for the procedure.

John Cavazos said he held Pookie in his arms as the dog died. &ldquo;They shot my dog multiple times and left it for dead,&rdquo; Cavazos said. &ldquo;I had to call them back out to euthanize him.&rdquo; Westworth Village police Lt. Glenn Lippertt said that officers responding to a 911 call Thursday found a bulldog mix killing another large dog in the back yard of a home in the 5800 block of Straley Avenue. The officers reported that the bulldog had broken a steel-cable tether and attacked the other dog, which was still tethered, Lippertt said. The officers shot the bulldog twice with a Tazer and twice with beanbag rounds from a shotgun, trying to get it off the other dog, Lippertt said. When that failed, they shot it with a 45-caliber pistol. Cavazos said he was at work when he got a call from his fiance, who told him he needed to come home because his dog had been shot. He said he arrived about 1:30 p.m. to find the bulldog &ldquo;covered in a blanket, kicking and screaming.&rdquo; Cavazos said Pookie was an American bulldog mix and his other dog is a German shepherd mix named Dino. He said the dogs had a habit of getting into fights. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been together for five years and they just get into it every few months,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We just have to hose them down and they separate.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s what Cavazos&rsquo; son, Kameran Jordan, 7, and nephew, Jeremiah Smith, 12, and his father, Johnny Cavazos, were trying to do when the officers arrived. The 911 call that summoned them was made by former Westworth Village Mayor Jim Parnell, who lives next door. Parnell said that he saw Jordan, Smith and the elder Cavazos trying to separate the dogs, and that he even tried spraying water on the dogs himself from the safety of his yard. &ldquo;The pit bull had Dino where he couldn&rsquo;t get loose and was killing him,&rdquo; Parnell said. &ldquo;I knew Dino was going to die, so I called 911.&rdquo; Officers responded within moments, Parnell said, and were communicating with Johnny Cavazos. &ldquo;The police officer was saying, &lsquo;What do you want me to do?&rsquo; &rdquo; Parnell said. &ldquo;The man told the kids to go inside. I saw the officer pull his gun. He told me to get inside, because I was in the line of fire. I got my wife into the house and heard a pop. A little later I heard a pop-pop, and looked outside again. The pit bull was walking around, then he went after Dino again.&rdquo; Lippert said that what happened then was unlike anything he&rsquo;s seen in his 18 years with Westworth Village police. After the Tazer and beanbag rounds failed to make the bulldog release his grip on the other dog&rsquo;s throat, the officers said the older Cavazos asked them to shoot it, Lippert said. &ldquo;One officer shot the pit bull once with a 45-caliber and it broke off from the other dog,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But then it rushed back in and attacked the other dog again. The officer shot the pit bull a second time, and it let go and laid down.&rdquo; About then, Lippert arrived at the scene and saw that the bulldog was down with two gunshots to its body, but not dead. He said that because the bulldog was suffering, he told one of the officers to shoot it again. The officer fired one round into the dog&rsquo;s head, Lippert said, and when the bulldog stopped moving, the officers thought it was dead and left. When Cavazos called Westover police back to the yard, Lippert said he was shocked to see that the bulldog was still breathing. &ldquo;We called Fort Worth Animal Control, and they used four injections before it finally died,&rdquo; he said. Audio recorded by police during the incident confirms everything the officers reported, Lippert said. The two officers involved will not be identified until the reports are released Monday or Tuesday, he said. Cavazos believes none of the police measures were necessary. &ldquo;My son knows how to deal with the dogs and had they not intervened with such disgustingly brutal force my dog would still be alive,&rdquo; Cavazos said. &ldquo;They took matters into their own hands.

It appeared to be unattended and aggressively barking at children as they walked to school. According to investigators, the dog broke from a chain and attacked an adult and child. A passing motorist saw the attack and stopped, grabbing a rake to help hold the dog off. Those victims, identified as 44-year-old Michelle Bennett and 14-year-old Alen Velic, were taken to the hospital with bite wounds to their legs. Velic was on his way to school, but never made it there. &quot;It just came out of nowhere and started attacking us,&quot; he said.

Some say it was unnecessary force. ABC11 cameras captured the incident at a home on Dunstan Avenue April 12. Officers were looking for Pete Moses and Vania Sisk. According to search warrants, Moses is a suspect in the disappearance of a woman and a 5-year-old boy. Sisk is the boy&#039;s mother. While they&#039;ve not been charged in the disappearances, the SWAT team arrested the pair on other charges at the Dunstan Avenue home after surrounding it the evening of April 12. After the people in the home surrendered, the SWAT team approached to make sure no one else was inside. As ABC11 cameras recorded, the lead officer went up the front steps and then turned and fired at a dog three times - killing it. The dog doesn&#039;t appear to be vicious and doesn&#039;t appear to lunge at officers. In the video, you can see a man sitting on the stoop of a home next door and others standing on the next porch as the three high-powered rounds were fired in their direction. The bystanders were not hurt. Eighteen-year-old Deshawn Porter told ABC11 the dog - a lab named Sheba - was his best friend.\r\n&quot;I didn&#039;t know what to say,&quot; he said. &quot;My neighbor says they shot my dog several times.&quot; Porter said he asked police why the dog was killed. &quot;He said the dog was getting vicious and ready to attack,&quot; said Porter. But that&#039;s not how others saw it. ABC11 asked the Durham Police Department about the incident. It said the officers were making a high-risk entry and the dog appeared to growl and make aggressive moves. We showed the video to Kimberly Alboum, state director for the Humane Society. &quot;That&#039;s devastating,&quot; she said. &quot;Wow, that&#039;s absolutely devastating. That&#039;s just shocking.&quot; Alboum said she sees in the video a SWAT team that needs to be trained in dealing with dogs. &quot;The way it appears on this footage, is that it was just a dog standing up watching them come up on the stairs,&quot; she said.

The report states as fact a police claim that the same report explains is contested and was made without evidence in a graph after the jump. Lazy errors like this are a common feature of Puppycide reporting: When Mary and Rickey Brown heard barking in their yard Monday afternoon, they never imagined they were in danger. That quickly changed when they realized four aggressive dogs were confronting the men painting their house. &ldquo;One of them ran into our house,&rdquo; Mary Brown said. &ldquo;My daughter was frightened and then another dog, a pit bull, ran around back and bit our painter on the arm,&rdquo; she said. The dogs had somehow escaped their home next door, and entered through a hole in the Brown&rsquo;s fence. Mary&rsquo;s husband told her to call 9-1-1. &ldquo;The pit bull was really aggressive, and even foaming at the mouth,&rdquo; he said. Seattle firefighters and paramedics parked their vehicles directly in the driveway of the home where the dogs live. The Browns watched as the paramedics and firefighters were surrounded by the aggressive dogs. &ldquo;They couldn&rsquo;t get to the wounded man because of the dogs,&rdquo; she said. Seattle police officers shot and killed a mixed-pitbull terrier Tuesday after it bit a man in the arm, drawing blood. A dog from the same home bit a Seattle Police Officer last August. Tuesday officers were called to the same home just after 1 p.m. because a man painting a home nearby had been bitten in the arm. When firefighters tried to give the bite victim medical aid the dog and three others barked and lunged, so firefighters called police. The dog, 4-year old Aries, is described as a mixed-breed American Staffordshire terrier which is a type of pit bull. Kim Pace lives with Aries&#039; owner and says something must have provoked him. &quot;It&#039;s their property,&quot; Pace said, &quot;They probably felt threatened and felt like they needed to defend their area. If an animal of any breed feels like they are backed into a corner, they will defend themselves; it has nothing to do with the fact that they are pit bulls.&quot; Witt says officers and firefighters tried many methods to get the loose dogs, described as three pit bulls and one smaller dog, to retreat with no success: &quot;One of the firefighters used a clipboard to throw at the dogs, and he tried to kick them but they continued to advance on the firefighters, and then the officers also used a fire extinguisher, they used pepper spray and none of that worked.&quot; Officers felt threatened enough for one of them to open fire. But neighbors say they have never had any trouble with Aries or any of the other dogs who live with Kim Pace. &quot;I&#039;ve had pit bulls before. I&#039;m very comfortable with them. I think they&#039;re misunderstood a lot,&quot; said neighbor Felicia Saephan. &quot;Honestly I don&#039;t know what to think,&quot; said neighbor Demetria Ahlquist, &quot;because I told them the owners were coming and if they just waited they could have gotten him safely and this wouldn&#039;t have happened.&quot; The officer who fired the fatal shot is on paid administrative leave while the SPD&#039;s Firearms Review Board conducts its investigation into the shooting. The dogs&rsquo; owner also wanted to clarify a claim made by Seattle Police on Tuesday. Officer Renee Witt told reporters the dog police shot was the same Pit Bull that bit an officer on the hand inside a home last August.

Reportedly, the trio of dogs has attacked a man earlier Wednesday morning. Lt. Tracey Ibarra said the man, 37-year-old Andrew Ross of Pasadena, suffered slight puncture wounds to his left leg and scrapes to his knee but declined medical treatment. The dog that was killed was a female pit bull or pit bull mix less than a year old, according to Ricky Whitman, spokesperson for the Pasadena Humane Society and SPCA. Whitman said the dog wasn&rsquo;t spayed and looked like it was in heat. She didn&rsquo;t know yet the breed of the injured dogs. Police identified all three dogs as pit bulls or pit bull mixes. The incident happened shortly after 5 a.m. Wednesday in the 1400 block of Fair Oaks Avenue. Ross was walking his bicycle southbound when the dogs charged him from across the street, according to Ibarra. She said Ross tried to put the bike between himself and dogs that were trying to bite his legs. One bit him. Ross dropped his bicycle and jumped onto the hood of a parked car, Ibarra said. Police found out about the incident when a woman called and said dogs were attacking a man on the sidewalk on Fair Oaks Avenue. &ldquo;The witness reported that the man was being dragged by the dogs, that he was able to break free and take refuge on top of a parked vehicle,&rdquo; Ibarra said.\r\nPolice were told the dogs were still in the area. Two officers found Ross, who was still perched on the car. He pointed out the three dogs north of the vehicle and standing on the sidewalk. Ibarra said it was still dark. The officers used the spotlight on the dogs. The canines trotted south and past Ross. The officers got out of the unit and were now adjacent to the vehicle, Ibarra said. She said the dogs turned around and walked back towards the officers. They were growling and barking as they neared the police, she added. One of the officers fired a shotgun multiple times. &ldquo;The lead dog goes down to the ground,&rdquo; Ibarra said. The two other dogs, which were injured, ran southbound. They were later found and taken by an animal control officer. Ibarra said the dogs had no tags and police don&rsquo;t know who owns the dogs. Ross didn&rsquo;t return a phone call seeking comment. Steve McNall, president and CEO of the Pasadena Humane Society and SPCA, said the two wounded dogs were being treated at an animal emergency center in South Pasadena. A necropsy will be done on the dead dog to find out if it had rabies, he added. McNall said police reached the dogs before an animal control officer, who was in Glendale when the call came in. Councilman Steve Madison, who proposed the mandatory spay/neuter ordinance for pit bull breeds, posted on Facebook about the attack. &ldquo;Pit bulls viciously attacked a cyclist in Pasadena this morning. A witness calling 9-1-1 reported that the dogs were dragging the cyclist down the street. When officers responded the cyclist was up on a car. The pits charged the officers and were shot with a shotgun,&rdquo; Madison wrote. &ldquo;Coincidentally, 36 hours ago my colleagues on the City Council rejected my proposed ordinance that would have called for mandatory spay and neuter of pit bulls. Not a ban, mind you, or even a limit on the number one can own, just spay and neuter to control the overpopulation of this breed. One of my colleagues, Terry Tornek, stated that the &lsquo;evidence&rsquo; did not support the ordinance.&rdquo; When reached by phone, Madison said he wasn&rsquo;t surprised by Wednesday&rsquo;s incident. He has pushed to ban pit bulls in Pasadena for the past two years. Bans on the animals are prohibited by state law, &ldquo;This is going to happen, that was the whole point of my work on this issue over the last couple of years,&rdquo; Madison said. &ldquo;They are just a time bomb. They are killing machines.&rdquo; Madison said he found out about the alleged attack from an e-mail that Police Chief Phillip Sanchez sent to all council members. He said he did not know Ross. Pit bull advocate Josh Liddy of Pasadena said the attack was a problem of circumstance and owner neglect, not breed. He also doubted the identification of the dogs as pit bulls. &ldquo;Just because a police officer claims a dog is a pit bull doesn&rsquo;t mean it is. Even the Humane Society said they don&rsquo;t know how to identify dogs,&rdquo; Liddy said. &ldquo;Even if it was three pit bulls it&rsquo;s still three loose dogs. The breed is irrelevant. You can&rsquo;t demonize every pit bull in Pasadena because three loose dogs attacked a cyclist. It just doesn&rsquo;t make sense.&rdquo; In a statement, Chief Sanchez said it was very fortunate the victim was not badly injured by the attacking dogs. &ldquo;If the animals had been properly secured, this might not have happened. In this instance the officer&rsquo;s quick actions prevented anyone else from being harmed,&rdquo; Sanchez said. The police department isn&rsquo;t conducting a criminal or internal affairs investigation on the shooting. &ldquo;(Due to the) circumstances of the situation, we felt that his actions were not only reasonable but necessary for public safety,&rdquo; Ibarra said. She said the dogs were growling and barking as they approached the officer and had already attacked a man. Any use of force results in a review of department policy and procedure, Ibarra said. A use-of-force report is done which gets reviewed at a later date, she added. At this time, she said the department is not releasing the name of the officer who shot the dog.\r\n&ldquo;There will be an administrative review on the use of force,&rdquo; she said. Under the officer&rsquo;s bill of rights, Ibarra said the officer has the right not to have his name released.','http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/general-news/20140129/pasadena-police-fatally-shoot-pit-bull-after-attack-injure-two-other-dogs','Unknown','Two Unknown Police','1','0',2,0,0,'3','3','Uniform','3','3','0','0','0','0'),(1020,'2010-09-22','Maryland','Landover','Prince Georges County Police Department',1,50,0,'Rottweiler mix 4yo','Two men armed with guns attempted to rob a familys house. The family defended themselves with a gun, resulting in a brief shoot-out. The robbers fled. The family immediately called police. On arrival, the police beat one of the family members while detaining his elderly mother in the home and forcing her not to use her own bathroom. While five police held the man down and punched him in the face, a female police officer shot and killed his dog. Neighbors witnessing these events confirmed the dog did not attack anyone and was merely present in the front yard. Police then charged and arrested the man for a host of charges, including insulting an officer. The police made no attempt to pursue the men who robbed the home. Local news described the event as follows: Family members claim they called police for help Wednesday morning, but when officers arrived, they were treated like criminals and an officer shot and killed their family dog. It all unfolded in the 1100 block of Fiji Lane in Landover. Four-year-old Mercedes, a Rottweiler mix, is the latest dog shot and killed by police in Prince George&#039;s County. Dog owner Sterling Barlow said about Mercedes, &quot;Cold blood... Shot in the head for no reason.&quot; The problem started when owner Sterling Barlow&#039;s brother pulled into the family driveway after work early Wednesday morning. The family claims two men immediately approached, armed with a gun and demanding his car. The brother managed to fight them off, ran into the house and came back out firing his gun. &quot;If somebody did that to your family you will retaliate the best way you know how,&quot; said Barlow. After a shootout with the alleged robbers, the two brothers called police. When police arrived, Barlow says things got out of hand with the officers and his innocent dog paid the tragic price. Barlow said, &quot;One grabs me in the head lock and starts punching me in the face.&quot; Mother Dwana Barlow said, &quot;The police officer wouldn&#039;t even let me go to the bathroom... and held me hostage in my own house.&quot; While being wrestled to the ground by five different cops, Barlow and witnesses in the neighborhood tell us a female Prince George&#039;s County officer shot the dog in the head. Barlow stated, &quot;While this was going on I said &#039;please, don&#039;t point a gun at my dog.&#039; I begged her. She didn&#039;t need to be involved in this. She was in the yard.&quot; But Barlow was arrested and charged with multiple crimes, including insulting an officer. Police say the officer acted appropriately when shooting the dog. Neighbor Barbara Wells said, &quot;The dog did not attack anyone. He never approached anyone. Even as the officers grabbed Sterling the dog didn&#039;t do anything.&quot; Police spent hours Wednesday searching for the full police report. Around 10:30 p.m. Wednesday, police called ABC 7 News on the phone and confirmed that an officer did shoot and kill the dog out of self defense.

Police said officers were chasing a home invasion suspect through Damron&#039;s neighborhood on Madelon Court around 6 p.m. when the suspect darted into her back yard. &quot;I got up to see what was going on because the dog was raising a fit, just barking, and I saw somebody else come as I was getting to the door, and as soon as I opened the door, I heard two gunshots,&quot; Damron said. &quot;I looked over and my dog was hollering and there was blood everywhere, and he went inside of his dog house and eventually died.&quot; &quot;He went back in there crying and screaming and eventually died. He suffered,&quot; Damron continued. &quot;They were chasing an armed robber and I guess he feared he was going to get bit. That dog wouldn&#039;t have bit.&quot; Police said the Doberman jumped on the suspect and then attacked an officer. They said the officer had to shoot the dog in self-defense and to protect the suspect. Still, Damron is unconvinced. &quot;It did not give them the right to shoot my dog. I mean, a dog is going to bark. That&#039;s his job. He&#039;s in his yard. You come in his yard, he&#039;s going to bark,&quot; Damron said.

When the officers arrived, the suspects fled into the yard where the dog was, Garcia said. The officers were trying to catch the suspects when the dog attacked the K-9. An officer tried several times to free the K-9 from the other dog but it didn&#039;t work, Garcia said. &quot;The officer, who was in fear for his and his K-9 partner&rsquo;s safety, used lethal force to free his K-9 partner from the other dog&rsquo;s mouth,&quot; Garcia said in a statement. She didn&#039;t say whether any suspects were taken into custody. Antonio Spann, the pit bull&#039;s owner, said he had warned police about the dog and told them not to open the fence, which was chained and had a sign reading &quot;Beware of The Dog.&quot; &quot;I hear one shot. &#039;Boom.&#039; Then two shots, &#039;boom, boom&#039;,&quot; Spann said. &quot;That means he was shot again when he already down.&quot; Spann&#039;s father, Anthony Sinkfield, said he tried to stop the officers. &quot;When they opened the gate, the dog rushed out and the officer ran out and before I could get outside to tell the dogs to go back, they shot and killed my dog,&quot; Sinkfield said.\r\nSinkfield said he&#039;d had the pit bull, a 4-year-old named U-law, since he was a puppy. &quot;We raised them since they were puppies, they were like part of the family,&quot; he said. Spann said to make matters worse, officers just left the dog laying on the ground. &quot;They left my dog there all night long, you&#039;re talking about cruelty to animals,&quot; Spann said. &quot;They didn&#039;t do anything, they just left my dog on the ground and left, didn&#039;t say anything to us, picked up the shell casings and just left,&quot; Sinkfield said. A police department spokesperson said officers on scene offered to help with the removal of the animal, but the owner would not allow it.

The boy&rsquo;s family members ran out of the house to pull the pit bull off of the boy when the family&rsquo;s black Labrador retriever began fighting with the pit bull, Carreon said. &ldquo;Once the black dog was tazed, it started to walk back up the porch to the house when the other followed,&rdquo; Carreon recalled. As the family tried to save the boy, neighbors also ran into the street to assist, he said. &ldquo;It was chaotic for a while,&rdquo; Carreon said. When police arrived on scene, they used a Taser on both dogs before an officer shot the pit bull to death. Carreon said police used the Taser on the pit bull four times before they had to shoot it. The boy&rsquo;s aunt, Kristen Tucker, 27, said her nephew suffered a gash on his leg. She said the pit bull had her nephew by the leg when she and other relatives ran to pull the dog off. &ldquo;We thought he was going to go for his throat,&rdquo; the boy&rsquo;s grandmother, Liz Ellis, said. &ldquo;I started hollering we needed help because they weren&rsquo;t getting their dog off the kid.&rdquo; Two neighbor girls also ran to the porch to help the boy, Ellis said.

Ellis said she&rsquo;s seen the pit bull tied up in the neighbor&rsquo;s yard at 688 W. 13th St., but the neighbor is denying ownership of the dog. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve got a dog and you know it bites, you&rsquo;ve got to keep it locked down,&rdquo; Ellis said.

He can&#039;t understand why an officer shot the dog dead. Cooke&#039;s yellow Labrador retriever Callaway was shot once in the head by officer Mark Morales near the back door to Cooke&#039;s house about 4:30 p.m. Saturday. Cooke said he was away at Mass when his burglar alarm went off. Officers responded and started to check the back door to see if anyone had broken in. The dog ran at Morales in a &quot;full aggressive charge,&quot; the officer wrote in a preliminary report, and posed an &quot;imminent threat of physical harm.&quot; Cooke, a dentist, noted that Morales was not bitten or scratched by the dog. He said Morales should have either kicked the dog away or used his Taser or pepper spray. &quot;He could have done any number of things, other than shoot the dog,&quot; Cooke said. &quot;I don&#039;t think any family should have to endure this.&quot; Police took Callaway, named after the golf equipment, to the West Park Animal Hospital and notified Cooke and his family. Cooke said he agreed to euthanize the dog. News of the shooting made its way through animal rights e-mail lists Sunday and Monday. Most of those e-mails did not mention the dog charging the officer, only that it barked. By late Monday, police and Westlake Mayor Dennis Clough received several calls and e-mails angry over the shooting. &quot;I am mortified,&quot; wrote resident Linda Stacks. Resident and dog owner Jessica Monnolly called the shooting &quot;shocking&quot; in an e-mail. &quot;I am rightly concerned about my own dog&#039;s well-being should something like this (house alarm, etc.) happen at my home,&quot; she wrote. &quot;What are the regulations that protect us and our dogs from the same fate!?&quot; The Animal Protective League in Cleveland plans to review the incident, said director Sharon Harvey. The group needs to know more facts before reaching any conclusions, she said. Clough cannot remember any previous incidents of officers shooting pets at homes in his more than 20 years as mayor. He said he would wait for a full report before making further comment. &quot;We&#039;re sorry about the dog being shot,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#039;s an unfortunate incident at this point.&quot; Police spokesman Ray Arcuri said officers do not believe any neighbors were home at the time of the shooting and urged any witnesses to come forward. He said supervisors will talk with Morales, but the standards for how police respond to the shooting of an animal differ from the shooting of a person. Morales has been on the force four years and has never fired his gun on duty before. He will continue working during the investigation, Arcuri said. Police and Cooke agree on the events that brought police to the house: Cooke said he keeps his two retrievers in his garage while away from the house and that the dogs probably pushed open the garage&#039;s back door, setting off the alarm. A third dog belonging to his daughter was also there.\r\nArcuri said the home has had four false alarms since the start of December and had a few earlier last year. Cooke said the dogs would naturally bark and approach officers and bark or growl since the officers are strangers on the dogs&#039; territory. But he insists the dogs do not bite and pose no real threat. Arcuri said one dog trotted toward Morales barking but Callaway ran past the other at the officer. Morales backed away and yelled at Callaway to stop, but he did not. The dog was shot three to four feet from where the officer was standing. &quot;He didn&#039;t have the option to go to things less than lethal,&quot; Arcuri said. Cooke said Morales could have taken shelter behind yard furniture near the door or gone around a fence. In the calls and e-mails to the city, others questioned training they said should have had the officer better prepared. U.S. Postal Service carriers deal with dogs on their routes all the time, but carry only pepper spray, said spokesman Victor Dubina. But in coming through the same areas regularly, they learn the dogs and behaviors and know which ones to watch out for. Even so, 18 carriers were bitten last year in the Greater Cleveland area, which includes most of Cuyahoga County. Another seven were injured evading dogs.','http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2010/03/owner_animal_advocates_questio.html','Callaway','Mark Morales','1','0',0,0,0,'0','0','Uniform','1','2','0','0','2','0'),(1028,'2011-01-12','Washington','Seattle','Seattle Police Department West Precinct',2,2,0,'Unconfirmed','A Seattle police officer responding to a report of domestic violence shot a dog Wednesday in West Seattle.

Police reported hearing hysterical screams from a woman and growling dogs inside the home. Officers entered through an unlocked front door and saw two dogs on top of a woman, according to investigators. Officers found blood on the mouths of the two dogs and blood on the clothing and hands of the woman, a department spokesman said. After the woman broke free, police said the dogs attacked each other. When one of the dogs reportedly charged at the officers, both were shot. One dog died, the other survived. The woman was arrested after it was suspected she assaulted her brother at the home.

Moses&rsquo; 7-month-old Akita dog, Diva, was shot 13 times and killed April 5 during police pursuit of juveniles who&rsquo;d been driving down South Side streets and shooting. But Youngstown&rsquo;s police chief says the situation called for a quick decision to protect police officers. The driver of the 1998 Pontiac had fled from police, and pulled into a front yard on Lucius Avenue. There, officers chased the five suspects on foot, a police report states. One of the five was followed into the East Lucius Avenue home of Moses and Darcel Gilmore. Officers were met inside the house by the couple&rsquo;s 42-pound dog. The teenager ran down the basement stairs to hide. When officers opened the basement door from the kitchen, &ldquo;the dog approached Officer [Ryan] Laatsch in an aggressive manner,&rdquo; the police report states. There were three officers in the house. &ldquo;Officer Laatsch, who already had service weapon drawn due to the circumstances of the situation, shot approximately five to six times striking the dog ... then shot the dog approximately five to six more times ...then shot the dog one more time directly in the top of his head from only a few inches away,&rdquo; the report stated. &ldquo;I know you have to do your job, but they overdid it,&rdquo; said Moses, who has no relationship to the teenager who ran into the house. One of the other juveniles was Gilmore&rsquo;s son, but does not live at the East Lucius Avenue residence, Moses said. When the basement door was opened, Diva had been trained to come upstairs to be let outside. The dog never had any problems with the neighbors nor any history of aggressiveness, he said. &ldquo;She was still a puppy &mdash; still playful,&rdquo; Moses said. &ldquo;If she was so vicious, why wouldn&rsquo;t she attack the stranger who ran into the basement?&rdquo; he asked. Akitas can weigh about 100 pounds when fully grown. Dave Nelson, Mahoning County deputy dog warden, said they are generally a breed to use caution around. Akitas are generally protective of their family and property, he said. Police Chief Jimmy Hughes said officers had few options. &ldquo;For the most part, the [situation] came about in fast succession, within close quarters and the officers had little place to go,&rdquo; Hughes said. The kitchen where the dog was shot is about 7 feet by 15 feet, Moses estimated. &ldquo;The dog was coming after the officer and he was in fear for his life and the lives of the other officers,&rdquo; Hughes said. Officers are taught to use force when necessary and Laatsch didn&rsquo;t have much room or time to defend himself, he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s unfortunate that it was as many rounds as it was, but he fired until the dog ceased to attack,&rdquo; Hughes said. The suspect hiding in the basement was arrested on obstructing official business charges. Officers found a box of live ammunition, as well as a scale and a bag of suspected cocaine near the suspect&rsquo;s hiding place, the report states. The items were collected as evidence, but no one is charged in connection with the items. Moses and Gilmore said their dog and home were innocent bystanders to the episode that left their dog dead and kitchen with seven bullet holes in the floor, as well damage to their walls and refrigerator.\r\n&ldquo;That was a daughter,&rdquo; Gilmore said of Diva. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m messed up; we raised her since she was 5 weeks old,&rdquo; Moses added. Officers should have used a different kind of force, such as pepper spray, the couple said. &ldquo;It was just a senseless killing,&rdquo; Moses said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if restitution is in order at this time&rdquo; for the dog and house owners, Hughes said. Taser guns may have been an alternative to shooting the animal, but officers aren&rsquo;t equipped with that kind of weapon, he said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t encourage officers to shoot their guns unless it&rsquo;s a life-threatening situation,&rdquo; Hughes said. &ldquo;In this case, they felt it was life-threatening.&rdquo;','http://www.vindy.com/news/2009/apr/14/youngstown-police-shoot-8216aggressive8217/','Diva','Ryan Laatsch and Two Unknown Police','2','0',1,0,0,'0','0','Uniform','0','0','2','2','2','2'),(1030,'2013-09-23','Arizona','Kingman','Kingman Police Department',1,50,0,'German Shepherd','Police shot a dog while it was restrained on a choke pole.

Patrolman William McCauley reported that while he was checking an area where cars are often stripped next to the Lehigh River off E. Market Street, he came across a man who was walking his dog and had no identification, gave two dates for his birth and no address. McCauley requested a warrant check on the man, who gave the name Isreal Rosario, 46 or 47, and was told first there were no warrants for Rosario, then that the state Probation Office issued a warrant for possession with the intent to deliver drugs. McCauley said he had already let Rosario go, but called after him to secure his dog, drop a duffle bag he was carrying and approach the officer to be arrested. According to McCauley&#039;s report, Rosario was handcuffed, and the dog broke free and charged toward the officer menacingly. McCauley reported he placed Rosario between himself and the charging dog when the suspect did nothing to stop the dog&#039;s progress. McCauley said he raised his shotgun to shoot the dog, when a backup officer, David Cimera, fired his service revolver. Cimera reported he fired three shots and the dog may have been hit on one of its rear paws. Rosario ordered the dog to stop after the shooting, police said.

Responding to complaints of loud music, three Burbank police officers arrived at the hilltop home of Avis Gyandzhyan, in the 2500 block of East Elmwood Avenue, just as the combination Halloween-birthday party was ending and people were gathered on the front lawn saying their good nights around 11 p.m. Wednesday. Max, the family&#039;s beloved boxer, who was dressed in a cowboy costume for the party, barked and ran out to the entrance of the courtyard on the Gyandzhyan property to greet the officers, one of whom then removed his gun from his holster and shot the dog in the head with one bullet, said Alisa Abelian, one of the dog&#039;s owners. &quot;Instead of saying, &#039;Please, hold your dog,&#039; he just takes out his gun and shoots him in the head, not in the leg, in the head,&quot; said Abelian, 27, who had helped raise Max since he was a puppy.

After being shot, the dog ran away from police and has yet to be found. Animal control officers were called to the 4400 block of Anderson Ave. on Tuesday night by residents who were concerned about dogs running loose in the neighborhood, according to Suffolk spokeswoman Debbie George. When they arrived, the animal control officers were trapped in their vehicle by two dogs, a boxer and a black Labrador, which charged the vehicle every time officers attempted to leave the vehicle, she said. They soon called for police backup. When police officers arrived on the scene, George said both animals &ldquo;acted in an aggressive manner&rdquo; to the officers. The police officers attempted to use their tasers on the dogs, but they were unsuccessful. The dogs still kept charging at the officers, until officers shot at them, George said on Tuesday. The boxer ran away and was not found until late Wednesday morning. After being shot at the first time, the Labrador retriever, according to George, charged again at the officers. The officers than shot again at the dog, this time hitting the animal, which ran away to the nearby woods, limping. Police officers and animal control officers could not find the dog Tuesday. As of press time Wednesday, the dog has not been found. The owners of the boxer was charged with allowing a dog to run at large. The owner of the missing lab, Tiffanie Garner, also was charged with allowing a dog to run at large, along with not having a city license for the animal, according to George. George added that the officers acted well within their rights to shoot at the dogs. &ldquo;Officers do have the authority to euthanize an animal if they feel it is a danger to someone else or the officers themselves,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Every situation is handled on a case-by-case basis.

Paula Rodecap said Friday afternoon she had been told by a Topeka animal control officer that the dog would recover from its wounds. But she is angry that officials won&rsquo;t tell her where the dog is being held after being treated by a local veterinarian, and even angrier that she can&rsquo;t retrieve the animal until appearing in municipal court to answer charges related to maintaining a dangerous dog. The incident was reported around 1:30 a.m. Friday in an alley behind a residence at 1532 S.W. Central Park as two police officers were responding to a call. Police Lt. Chuck Haggard said a dog &ldquo;charged&rdquo; toward one of the officers from the backyard of a residence. The officer responded by shooting the dog. Rodecap, 44, said the staffordshire pit bull terrier named Jackson Smore suffered at least one gunshot wound to his right hind-quarter. She said Jackson Smore is a registered companion dog to her husband, Rick Rodecap, 56, who is disabled, and that his personal care attendant had let the dog out the back door to relieve itself around 1:30 a.m. Friday. She said the dog encountered a pair of Topeka police officers who she said were doing &ldquo;foot patrol&rdquo; in the alley. She was inside her home watching television, she said, when she heard gunfire behind her house. She said police told her the dog was shot after it charged at them. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt the dog came at the officers,&rdquo; Rodecap said, &ldquo;but not in an aggressive manner.&rdquo; Rodecap said her backyard doesn&rsquo;t have a fence and the dog wasn&rsquo;t on a cable because it was only outside for a few minutes to go to the bathroom. She said her pit bull wasn&rsquo;t aggressive and that it was known as a friendly animal to residents of the Central Park neighborhood and at her former residence, Knightsbridge Manor, 501 S.W. Franklin, where she and her husband formerly lived. She said she found four spent shell casings in her backyard and questioned why officers had to shoot the dog, which she believes was moving away from officers when it was wounded. After the dog was shot, Rodecap said, it came back inside her residence where he &ldquo;bled all over the place.&rdquo; Bloodstains could be seen behind her home and inside her kitchen, living room, staircase and upstairs. Rodecap said she called for the police shift supervisor to come to her house after the incident because she was so upset. She said the supervisor did come to her home. However, she said, some officers at her residence left shortly before 2 a.m. to respond to a shooting in the 600 block of S.W. Tyler that turned out to be the city&rsquo;s fourth homicide of the year.

Cops were called when the dogs couldn&#039;t be separated, and when they arrived, witnesses were stunned at the reaction. One officer shot at the dogs five times with a pistol, then another fired one blast from a shotgun. Both dogs were killed. And this all went down right in front of Chester High School. Tehran Freeman, a dog owner himself who lives down the block from the shooting, captured the incident on video with his cell phone and was outraged at the handling of the situation. &quot;I don&#039;t care how bad they try to make Chester seem, this is not a war zone, you don&#039;t do things like that,&quot; he told NBCPhiladelphia.com. &quot;I thought them as the police should be held to a higher standard and would have some type of procedure for breaking it up than actually pulling out your pistols in front of the high school.&quot; Freeman told NBCNews.com that the bigger, more aggressive dog seemed to be a pit bull and had a leash, but the other smaller dog didn&#039;t. It was unclear who the owners were.

The incident started when police tried to pull over a vehicle for trying to run another vehicle off the road shortly after 11 p.m. Thursday, according to a news release from Lake City Police Department. Police say a 26-year-old man called 911 Thursday night to report a truck was driving recklessly behind him and trying to run him off the road. When police got to the intersection of U.S. 90 and S.W. Baya  Drive, they allegedly watched as both vehicles drove by and noted that the truck did not have its headlights on. Officers tried to pull the truck being driven by 47-year-old Timothy Schultz over, but Schultz reportedly did not stop for police. Schultz drove the speed limit as officers pursued, but he kept slamming on his brakes for an unknown reason. He continued driving until he reached his home in the 500 block of N.E. Jacksonville Loop where police saw him drive into his yard. Once out of his truck, Schultz stood and stared at the officers, before being ordered to get onto the ground several times. At that point Schultz reportedly opened the door to the back seat of his truck, releasing his dog, a German Shepherd. Once out of the truck, the dog ran aggressively toward police.\r\nOne of the officers then shot the dog, which then ran from the area. Officers then turned their attention back to dealing with Schultz, who was still not obeying officers&#039; commands. Police used a Taser on Schultz, but there was no effect. In fact, officers said Schultz even tried to remove the prongs from the Taser. A second officer used his Taser on Schultz, this time causing him to fall to the ground. As police attempted to handcuff Schultz, he allegedly continued to fight with officers until they finally subdued him. Officers contacted the animal shelter to treat the wounded German Shepherd. Schultz&#039;s injuries were treated by paramedics with Lifeguard EMS.\r\nSchultz was arrested and taken to the Columbia County Jail. While at the jail, corrections officers tried to get Schultz to give relevant samples, since police suspected him of DUI.  Schultz refused the test, resulting in his driver&#039;s license being automatically suspended for 12 months due to his refusal.

Note how in the lied the report claims that both dogs killed were pit bulls, while later the same article claims that one dog was a german shepherd and the other a pit bull mix: The city of Minneapolis has settled a lawsuit stemming from an incident two years ago in which city cops shot two pit bulls &mdash; one of which was so close to 3-year-old girl it splattered blood on her pajamas &mdash; in a North Minneapolis home. The City Council agreed to pay James and Aisha Keten $225,000 on March 29, a few weeks after U.S. District Judge Donovan Frank wrote that he would not dismiss several counts of a complaint filed in 2011. Most notably, Frank wrote that a reasonable juror could conclude that a Minneapolis police officer acted unreasonably when he fired multiple shots into small kitchen with a young girl nearby. According to court documents: Officers on April 13 were conducting a search warrant, looking for an assault rifle they believed was used by James Keten&rsquo;s brother Lamont to shoot a woman eight days earlier. Officers were warned that four potentially aggressive pit bulls were in the home, and also that children would be present. First, one officer shot a 60-pound pit bill mix named Kano. The officer testified that the dog charged him. Keten alleges that officers hand-tied him and beat him, but a hospital could find no bruises or injuries to Keten. Another officer, Chad Fuchs, went into the kitchen where the couple&rsquo;s 3-year-old daughter was eating breakfast. The Kenten&rsquo;s allege that Fuchs fired several shots close to the girl, including ones that killed a 40-pound pit bull-German Shepard mix named Remy. Remy was sitting near the feet of the girl. Remy&rsquo;s blood splattered on the girl&rsquo;s pajamas, and the girl has since been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. She regularly sees the therapist. Aisha Keten attempted to rush into the kitchen to grab her daughter, but police restrained her in the bathroom, where she had been getting ready for work. Fuchs claims the dog was threatening, but the girl and Aisha Keten say the dog did not bark or growl. The family also says officers damaged several of their belongings. The gun was not found in the home, and Aisha and James were not arrested. City Attorney Susan Segal has not responded to request for comment this morning on possible punishment for any of the officers. The lawsuit identification information is as follows: Keten et al v.

The dog was killed Feb. 11 by a deputy who had gone to a residence in the 300 block of 20th Street East in Palmetto looking for 20-year-old Raphael J. Houston, who was wanted on grand theft and burglary charges. When a 13-year-old girl let the dog out a side door, a deputy looking for Houston shot and killed the dog. Now the family, who has retained an attorney, is considering a lawsuit. Tiffany Summerall, 13, who resides at the residence with her parents, Raphael O. Houston and Christina Summerall, and five younger siblings, said she let the family dog out not knowing deputies were in her yard. Brooklyn, a 6-year-old brown and white dog, normally was let out at the time the deputies were at the residence, according to family members. Tiffany heard a man&rsquo;s voice telling her to come and get the dog. &ldquo;I called the dog three times and then walked over,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;(The deputy) was swinging a walkie talkie at the dog. He then pulled out a gun. I said, &lsquo;Please don&rsquo;t shoot him. He&rsquo;s not going to bite.&rsquo;&rdquo; Tiffany called the dog one last time and the dog started to walk toward her, she said. &ldquo;He started walking toward me and he shot him,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I started screaming, &lsquo;Why did you shoot my dog?&rsquo;&rdquo; According to a sheriff&rsquo;s office internal affairs report, the deputy told investigators, &ldquo;The dog was barking and/or growling and bearing it&rsquo;s (sic) teeth. I began back peddling (sic) and the dog continued charging toward me and lunged toward me with its front legs leaving the ground. I swung my radio at the dog in an attempt to avoid being bitten.&rdquo; The sheriff&rsquo;s office classified the dog as a pit bull in reports, while the family said the dog was not a pit bull, but rather a mixed breed. The deputy told investigators Brooklyn lunged at him a several times before he fired. The dog sustained a gunshot wound to its right side and later died. Sheriff&rsquo;s office policy allows deputies to shoot dogs if they fear for their personal safety or the safety of others. The deputy was exonerated, according to the internal affairs report. &ldquo;Due to the fact the dog was aggressively pursuing (the deputy) with the apparent intention of inflicting physical harm, coupled with the fact that no one in the residence had any control over the animal whatsoever, (he) was only left with the options of being attacked by the dog or resorting to lethal force to terminate the attack,&rdquo; the reports states. Raphael J. Houston was not arrested, but he was picked up the next day.\r\nHouston&rsquo;s father lives at the residence, but Houston hasn&rsquo;t lived there in almost five years, according to family members. According to the sheriff&rsquo;s office, when deputies go to pick up people on warrants, they usually check the person&rsquo;s driver&rsquo;s license and latest arrest report and talk with their probation officer to determine their whereabouts. They look up relatives and known associates. Sometimes, they do surveillance on properties before making contact, according to authorities. According to the internal affairs report on the shooting, authorities relied upon the address on Raphael J. Houston&rsquo;s driver&rsquo;s license. &ldquo;His relatives live there. We had every reason to believe he might be there,&rdquo; said sheriff&rsquo;s spokesman Dave Bristow. Bristow said the family never filed a complaint with the sheriff&rsquo;s office\r\nHouston said his son was recently in jail. Had authorities checked with a probation officer or arrest reports, they would have had the correct address, he said &ldquo;If they had investigated, my dog would be alive today,&rdquo; Raphael O.

Luis Crespo, 54, is scheduled to appear in Mansfield Municipal Court on Thursday for a hearing on the charges, which stem from a June 5 case involving a 1 year old German shepherd named Thor that ran off after a freak accident in which a woman’s finger was amputated after it got caught in the dog’s harness. The dogs owner, Thomas Lockhart, said his fiancée, Patricia Adams, was walking the dog down stairs when a ring on her pinkie got caught in its harness. The finger was cut off when the dog pulled away from her. It took half her finger off, Lockhart said in an interview, adding that the dog did bite Adams other hand as she tried to free herself. Responding police from Beverly and Edgewater Park believed the dog had bitten Adams finger off, and the animal was shot after it allegedly approached the officers in an aggressive manner in a vacant lot off Perkins Lane. The dog was shot three times in the neck and chest, but survived after being treated at a veterinary hospital. The dog was returned to Lockhart on Thursday after being quarantined at the Burlington County Animal Shelter in Westampton. A follow up investigation with doctors confirmed that Adams injury was not consistent with a dog bite, and was more consistent with having the finger separated via pulling action, Public Safety Director Richard Wolbert said. Crespo was at the scene of the shooting and was charged with obstruction and disorderly conduct for allegedly failing to follow officers directions to stay away from the dog, Wolbert said. Crespo is also accused of ignoring officers instructions by chasing the dog after it was shot and of allegedly trying to grab the snare of an animal control officer after she arrived on the scene, he said. The case has been assigned to Mansfields municipal court because Crespo is a former member of the City Council. He served for about seven years, but was defeated first in the Democratic primary in June 2012 and later in the 2013 general election after he was reappointed to fill an unexpired term. Reached Friday, Crespo said he would contest the charges. He denied trying to take the animal control officers snare, and said he complied with officers instructions as soon as it was safe for him to do so. Crespo said he became involved in the incident after seeing the dog run loose along Warren Street. He said he initially believed the dog belonged to a friend, but he followed it into the vacant lot because he was worried it might injure a bystander. Crespo said the dog acted petrified in the lot, began growling and snarling at him when he approached, and moved toward him when he tried to back away. He said officers from Beverly and Edgewater Park arrived and came from behind him with their service weapons drawn. They yelled for me to get behind them, but the dog wouldnt let me move. He was growling and snarling and clearly petrified, Crespo said. I didnt feel safe moving. I didnt want to turn my back on him, because I was afraid Id get mauled. He said he was eventually able to retreat behind an Edgewater Park officer, who then shot the dog. I didnt interfere with officers. The only order I was given was to get behind them, Crespo said, adding that he did chase the dog after it was shot because he was afraid it might attack another bystander. Crespo said that he did not believe the animal needed to be shot and that he did not see it charge aggressively at any officers. I heard the officer say, If the dog comes any closer, Im taking it down. Then they shot it in the field, he said. Wolbert has said the shooting is under investigation. The identity of the officer who shot the dog has not been released. Crespo is no stranger to controversy in this small riverfront town. He was previously named in a sexual harassment lawsuit filed by a former female police officer and another female employee. The city paid a $200,000 settlement to the officer last year and a $75,000 settlement to the other employee in 2012. In April 2010, police responded to a bomb scare involving Crespos truck, but an investigation revealed there was no evidence that a third party was involved. In a letter obtained by the Burlington County Times, an assistant prosecutor with the Burlington County Prosecutors Office said there was evidence to suggest Crespo may have attached an inoperable device to his own truck for unknown reasons.','http://www.burlingtoncountytimes.com/news/local/former-beverly-councilman-charged-with-obstruction-in-dog-shooting/article_57eedac6-65d6-578a-beeb-a260f543fce8.html','Thor','Unknown','1','1',2,1,0,'2','2','Uniform','3','3','0','0','0','0'),(1060,'2010-04-10','Massachusetts','Beverly','Beverly Police Department',1,50,1,'English Bull Terrier','Beverly Police shot an English bull terrier to stop its attack on a 4-month-old border collie, which later had to be euthanized, Saturday, April 10. The terrier was euthanized as well. According to Beverly Police, the incident occurred at 10 a.m. near Bay and Lothrop streets, where a man was walking his border collie. Without warning, the dog was attacked by an unleashed bull terrier as the collie&rsquo;s owner tried unsuccessfully to kick the dog away. The terrier&rsquo;s owner, who tried to restrain her dog, told police the dog &ldquo;suddenly got loose from her house&rdquo; and was roaming unattended through the neighborhood. The responding officer ordered both owners to clear the area and discharged pepper spray at the terrier several times. When the dog didn&rsquo;t react to the spray and continued to attack the upper body and neck of the collie, the officer decided the dog was an &ldquo;obvious danger to other animals and people in the area&rdquo; and shot one round into the terrier&rsquo;s shoulder at close range. &ldquo;It was a pretty vicious attack, and the service officer had to use his weapon to subdue the dog,&rdquo; Beverly Police Public Information Officer April Clarizia said. The terrier finally stopped its attack, and both dogs were transported to Beverly Animal Hospital. A spokesperson for the hospital said one dog had to be euthanized. The other dog, she said, was taken to an emergency hospital, where it had to be euthanized later in the day. Although Beverly has a leash law, Animal Control Officer Jim Lindley said it is unlikely the owner of the bull terrier will be cited in the incident. The dog had gotten loose but was not intentionally without a leash. Lindley said it is possible for the border collie&rsquo;s owner to take the bull terrier&rsquo;s owner to civil court, but he believes the two owners have come to an agreement on covering veterinary costs. &ldquo;Based on preliminary reports, the dog got out of the house through a faulty door,&rdquo; Lindley said &ldquo;The owner was out looking for the dog at the time.&rdquo; Clarizia said that in recent years there haven&rsquo;t been any similar attacks in which an officer had to shoot a dog to subdue it, although there have been smaller attacks. &ldquo;There has been nothing of this magnitude in the last few years,&rdquo; she said. Although English bull terriers are not closely related to the pit bull breed, which is considered to be a more aggressive type of dog, Lindley said he could not verify for certain the actual breed without seeing the dog himself. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s what it actually was,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Sometimes, people play games with the naming of the animal to avoid using the pit bull label.&rdquo; ','http://www.wickedlocal.com/article/20100413/News/304139741','Unknown','Unknown','1','0',2,0,0,'0','0','Uniform','3','3','0','0','2','0'),(1061,'2014-06-04','Oklahoma','Tulsa','Tulsa Police Department',1,2,1,'Unconfirmed','People at one north Tulsa apartment complex are upset after Tulsa police shot and killed a dog Wednesday night. They said this happened in front of several residents and children. FOX23&rsquo;s Angela Hong spoke with neighbors and police about the incident. FOX23 found out from police that a call came into 911 for a dog that was acting vicious. Right now the shooting is being reviewed as all officer-involved shootings are, but neighbors said this shouldn&rsquo;t have happened. Around 9:30 p.m. Wednesday night, the security at the Comanche Park Apartments tried to get the dog under control. Cell phone video showed the pit bull mix barking. Security pepper sprayed the dog three times, but it wouldn&rsquo;t calm down. Some neighbors told FOX23 the dog was likely scared and said it was anything but vicious. &ldquo;My kids were playing with it earlier in the day. My kids were outside when it was outside and it never once tried to attack any of my kids,&rdquo; said Tawny Glenn, a witness to the shooting. But the Tulsa Police Department said someone felt this dog was dangerous enough to call police. &ldquo;The dog might have been a friendly dog at one point but again, we were called to that location for a vicious dog,&rdquo; said Officer Leland Ashley with Tulsa police. When two Tulsa police officers got to the scene they found the dog on a porch after a few minutes of more barking neighbors heard three shots fired. &ldquo;They could have put a sheet over the dog and pinned it down. They could have brought a pole out and caught it with a breaker pole. There are a million of other things they could have done instead of shoot it in front of people,&rdquo; said Glenn. Some of the neighbors are upset that the dog was shot in front of young children, they say without warning. &ldquo;They here three to four shots and they bust out crying, wondering why it&rsquo;s happening,&rdquo; said Daniel Bass who also witnessed the shooting. But TPD said the officers did what they had to do for safety. &quot;Actions were taken at that point that officers felt needed to be taken. And unfortunately, if someone viewed it who didn&rsquo;t wish to view it, that&rsquo;s unfortunate, but as an officer you&rsquo;re first thinking of your safety and the safety of others,&rdquo; said Ashley. Neighbors told FOX23 they tried to tell security and officers they could get the dog to calm down but were repeatedly told to stay away. FOX23 also found out Tulsa animal control was not dispatched to the scene.','http://www.fox23.com/news/news/breaking-news/tulsa-police-shoot-and-kill-dog-at-north-tulsa-apa/ngHRm/','Unknown','Two Unknown Police','2','0',1,0,0,'2','2','Uniform','3','3','2','2','2','0'),(1062,'2013-05-18','New Jersey','Plainfield','Plainfield Police Division',2,50,0,'American Bulldog 5yo','The video is brief but disturbing: A woman, lying defenseless on a Plainfield street, pleads for help as two large dogs bite her relentlessly and onlookers scream in horror. One woman acts as a human shield, lying atop of the victim, while a bystander drags the dogs away by their hind legs and another uses a large stick to try and keep them at bay. But the animals continue to break free and lunge at the victim, until police officers show up and draw their pistols. Then, just as a car rolls into the frame, a series of loud gunshots ring out. Plainfield police officers shot and killed the two dogs Saturday on the 1000 block of West 7th Street, according to Police Director Martin Hellwig. The 5-year-old American bulldogs, which police and neighbors say did not have a history of violence, escaped from their backyard around 6 p.m. and attacked a woman walking down the street. &quot;These were very powerful dogs, and they were intent on doing damage,&quot; Hellwig said. The victim, whom police identified as a 55-year-old Plainfield resident, was semi-conscious and bleeding when officers arrived and found one dog with its teeth around her head. The officers shot and killed the first dog, and when the second dog ran toward the victim again, police killed it as well, Hellwig said. &ldquo;I think the officers displayed calmness and courage in the situation,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#039;m very proud of them.&quot; The victim is in stable condition Tuesday at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital, police said. She sustained numerous bites from both dogs. Shannon Gwynn was driving her boyfriend and cousin down West 7th Street when she saw the commotion. &ldquo;At first it looked like they were playing with her,&rdquo; Gwynn, 19, said. &ldquo;But I just stopped the car and I started screaming. They were on a mission &mdash; they just wanted to get at her.&rdquo; Gwynn, who took video of the ordeal and posted it to YouTube, said she tried to turn the car across the street in an attempt to hit the dogs, but there were too many people around. She wouldn&rsquo;t allow her boyfriend or cousin to get out of the car, either, because of how menacing the dogs looked as they returned again and again, biting the woman on the ground. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like it,&rdquo; Gwynn, of Edison, said. &ldquo;It was so gruesome.&rdquo; Neighbor Kashif Davis, 20, who witnessed the attack, said the dogs&rsquo; owner was the woman in the video using herself as a shield to protect the victim. &quot;The owner was lying on top of the lady to cover her,&quot; Davis said. His 24-year-old brother was the man in the video who used the large stick to keep the dogs back, he said.  Davis said police arrived quickly, and, realizing the victim was losing blood, were forced to act quickly. &quot;It took a lot to take them dogs out. After three shots, they were still running,&quot; Davis said. He said police shot the two dogs a total of 10 times as the owner stood by, watching sadly. &quot;It&#039;s tragic what happened, all the way around. Obviously no one wants to see the dogs killed, but they had to do what they had to do,&quot; Hellwig said. The dogs had been released into their backyard like any other day, Hellwig said, but the owner was unaware that her gate was left open. The dogs were able to get through the gate and into the front yard, where they attacked the victim. That gate was shut tight Tuesday, and a sign hanging from it read: &ldquo;Beware of Dogs.&rdquo; The dogs&#039; owner &mdash; who was not identified by police or neighbors &mdash; could not be reached for comment. None of the neighbors had ever complained about the dogs, Hellwig said, and an eyewitness told police they even appeared friendly just before the attack started. &ldquo;They were very nice dogs. I pet them through the gate,&quot; Davis said. The owner of the dogs, who Hellwig said does not have any history of problems with animals, was issued two summonses under a vicious dog ordinance and another two for violation of leash laws.','http://www.nj.com/union/index.ssf/2013/05/plainfield_police_shoot_2_dogs.html','Unknown','Unknown','2','0',2,1,0,'1','1','Uniform','3','3','2','0','0','0'),(1063,'2002-08-22','Minnesota','Minneapolis','Minneapolis Police Department',1,2,1,'Unconfirmed','Minneapolis police shot a 11 year old boy boy named Julius Powell while trying to kill a dog during a drug raid. The surrounding community was outraged, leading to demonstrations and riots. Both police and journalists were attacked. The boy was hospitalized, but survived his injuries. The story went national, covered by CBS, NPR and others. United Press International described the events as follows: Dozens of people shouted at police officers and attacked reporters late Thursday after 11-year-old boy was wounded from a bullet that ricocheted from a police officer&#039;s gun, a police spokeswoman said. The officer was shooting at a pit bull dog that had been turned loose on police who were trying to serve a search warrant on a house suspected of narcotics activity. The child, who lives at the house, was struck after the officer shot and killed the pit bull, but the bullet ricocheted off the street and struck him. The boy wounded in the drug raid was taken to a local hospital, said police spokesman Cyndi Barrington. His wounds did not appear to be life-threatening, she said. One person inside the house was taken into custody before the disturbance began, police said. While the police raid occurred at 7:30 p.m., tensions throughout the suburban Minneapolis community grew later as TV news crews arrived to cover the incident. Barrington said around 75 to 100 people gathered in the neighborhood and began to shout at police and journalists. Windows were broken out of one news van and a city bus, the police spokeswoman said. Two reporters from the Star Tribune of Minneapolis, a photographer for the St. Paul Pioneer Press and a reporter for WCCO-TV were hurt.

On Friday, four deputies with the Baldwin County Sheriff&#039;s Office were serving a warrant at a home on Stacey Drive. A spokesperson with the sheriff&#039;s office said the dog came after the deputy and that&#039;s when Belle was shot. The family however says that&#039;s not the case. In the hills near the Hadley&#039;s family homes, the pit bull is more like family than a four-legged friend. Angel Fretwell said Belle is old, toothless and hardly gets around anymore. She&#039;s lived to see generations of the Hadley&#039;s grow up, now Fretwell hopes she will live through this. &quot;She&#039;s gentle, she has a caring soul, she wouldn&#039;t hurt anything and she never has, we&#039;ve never had this problem ever,&quot; Fretwell said. According to Fretwell, when deputies arrived, Belle ran before she was shot in the shoulder. &quot;Somebody entered her home unannounced, I think she was just truly shocked, she didn&#039;t know what to do,&quot; she said, &quot;they have to be cautious, you know, I just think that maybe if they would have announced themselves or give it some kind of warning or anything at that point I think it would&#039;ve helped this situation a lot.&quot; She says after Belle was shot, deputies didn&#039;t allow them to go near the home or the dog for another hour. After the ordeal was over, Belle was taken to the Bay Minette Animal Clinic for surgery. According to Fretwell, veterinarians say it could cost as much as a $1,000.

Other living dogs could be heard barking inside the truck. Neighbors were sympathetic to police shooting the large dogs during a drug raid that occurred nearly an hour earlier, but wished the bodies weren&#039;t removed so crudely, especially with at least four children watching it all from neighboring homes and porch steps. &quot;What can you do?&quot; said neighbor Albert Garrett Jr. who watched the ordeal from across the street with his 3-year-old son. &quot;If you&#039;ve got three dogs in there and you know these dogs are killers, because they are going to go for your throat, no, I don&#039;t blame them&quot; for shooting the dogs. Garrett took his son, who rode a small bike with training wheels, down the street after he saw the dead dogs being brought out. &quot;He&#039;ll forget about it in time,&quot; said Garrett, but &quot;I was kind of amazed. They should have backed up to the house or something, rather than just drag the dogs across the street. &quot;They could have put them in bags.&quot; Another neighbor, she asked not to be named, said she heard the shots and police came over to tell her the dogs were shot. &quot;That&#039;s a shame,&quot; she said as the first body was loaded into the Animal Control truck. The neighbor had seen at least one of the three dogs in the backyard prior to Thursday but she couldn&#039;t gauge its demeanor. &quot;Unfortunately, with a lot of these drug houses, once you make entry, a lot of them do have pit bulls or any type of dog that will serve as guard dogs and that is their purpose, that is why they have them,&quot; said Detroit Police Officer Adam Madera of the Public Information Office. &quot;Officers should be cognizant of children in the area and not drag them out in front of them.

Michael Woody said narcotics, guns and a young baby were also in the house when police in riot gear entered the home with a search warrant about 1:30 p.m. Thursday. Jacqueline Banks, 52, who lives two doors to the west of the targeted home, said she saw one male resident placed under arrest. There was a lot of activity and noise at the residence, but Banks said she wasn&#039;t aware there was drug dealing going on.

They are just the most amazing dogs.&rdquo; Stephens said she plans to file a lawsuit against the sheriff&rsquo;s department and the Cheyenne Animal Shelter, which oversees the city and county&rsquo;s Animal Control officers. Bob Fecht, director of the animal shelter, said Animal Control Officer Myra Pacheco responded to a report of &ldquo;two dogs at large&rdquo; near College Drive, north of Laramie County Community College. When she arrived on the scene and exited her vehicle, Pacheco did not immediately see any dogs, Fecht said. &ldquo;Then they appeared and came full speed at her,&rdquo; Fecht said. &ldquo;She pulled out her baton to keep them at arm&rsquo;s length and backed up. Then she got back in her vehicle.&rdquo; The dogs then began to circle her vehicle. Pacheco called the sheriff&rsquo;s department for back-up, Fecht said. Soon after, two sheriff&rsquo;s deputies arrived on the scene, Fecht said. Gerry Luce, spokesman for the sheriff&rsquo;s department, identified the deputies as David Stevens and Heidi Koehler. Fecht, a former Cheyenne Police chief, said he knows Stevens personally. &ldquo;You are talking about a pretty experienced officer,&rdquo; he said. Luce said Stevens exited the police car while Koehler remained in the vehicle. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t get two steps out of the car before the dogs charged,&rdquo; Fecht said. Luce said, &ldquo;Deputy Stevens first tried to get the dogs to leave the area and retreat by yelling at them.&rdquo; The dogs continued to act in &ldquo;an extremely aggressive manor,&rdquo; and Stevens was forced to fire his service weapon and kill the dog, Luce said. After the incident, Star showed up on the nearby doorstep of Rica Robinson. Robinson described the year-and-a-half-old pit bull as &ldquo;kind and loving.&rdquo; &ldquo;She was just the sweetest thing,&rdquo; Robinson said. &ldquo;She got along with my dog, my cat, everyone.&rdquo; Robinson added, &ldquo;If they showed any aggression, it is probably because the Animal Control officer came at them with a (baton).&rdquo; She added, &ldquo;If (Buddy and Star) were anything alike, they were raised and trained to be very sweet.&rdquo; Robinson never had any contact with Buddy. Fecht said all dog breeds have innate character traits, like aggressiveness. &ldquo;But you can enhance or diminish those traits through training,&rdquo; Fecht said. &ldquo;(The Cheyenne Animal Shelter) can connect dog owners with trainers that can help dogs curtail or control those natural tendencies (like aggressiveness).&rdquo; Pit bulls are known to be a breed prone to aggressiveness. But that does not mean that all pit bulls are aggressive. It simply means they must be properly trained, Fecht said.','http://www.wyomingnews.com/articles/2014/01/25/news/01top_01-25-14.txt#.VC6T1fldXGA','Buddy','Deputy David Stevens, Deputy Heidi Koehler and Animal Control Officer Myra Pacheco ','2','0',2,0,0,'2','2','Uniform','3','3','2','2','2','0');
